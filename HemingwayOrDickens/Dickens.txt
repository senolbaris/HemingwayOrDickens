Chapter 1
The Period
It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of
wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was
the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of
Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had
everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct
to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way—in short, the period
was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities
insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative
degree of comparison only.
There were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a plain face, on
the throne of England; there were a king with a large jaw and a queen
with a fair face, on the throne of France. In both countries it was clearer
than crystal to the lords of the State preserves of loaves and fishes, that
things in general were settled for ever.
It was the year of Our Lord one thousand seven hundred and
seventy-five. Spiritual revelations were conceded to England at that
favoured period, as at this. Mrs. Southcott had recently attained her
five-and-twentieth blessed birthday, of whom a prophetic private in
the Life Guards had heralded the sublime appearance by announcing
that arrangements were made for the swallowing up of London and
Westminster. Even the Cock-lane ghost had been laid only a round
dozen of years, after rapping out its messages, as the spirits of this very
year last past (supernaturally deficient in originality) rapped out theirs.
Mere messages in the earthly order of events had lately come to the English Crown and People, from a congress of British subjects in America:
which, strange to relate, have proved more important to the human race
than any communications yet received through any of the chickens of
the Cock-lane brood.
France, less favoured on the whole as to matters spiritual than her
sister of the shield and trident, rolled with exceeding smoothness down
hill, making paper money and spending it. Under the guidance of her
Christian pastors, she entertained herself, besides, with such humane
achievements as sentencing a youth to have his hands cut off, his tongue
torn out with pincers, and his body burned alive, because he had not
kneeled down in the rain to do honour to a dirty procession of monks

A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
which passed within his view, at a distance of some fifty or sixty yards.
It is likely enough that, rooted in the woods of France and Norway,
there were growing trees, when that sufferer was put to death, already
marked by the Woodman, Fate, to come down and be sawn into boards,
to make a certain movable framework with a sack and a knife in it,
terrible in history. It is likely enough that in the rough outhouses of
some tillers of the heavy lands adjacent to Paris, there were sheltered
from the weather that very day, rude carts, bespattered with rustic mire,
snuffed about by pigs, and roosted in by poultry, which the Farmer,
Death, had already set apart to be his tumbrils of the Revolution. But
that Woodman and that Farmer, though they work unceasingly, work
silently, and no one heard them as they went about with muffled tread:
the rather, forasmuch as to entertain any suspicion that they were awake,
was to be atheistical and traitorous.
In England, there was scarcely an amount of order and protection to
justify much national boasting. Daring burglaries by armed men, and
highway robberies, took place in the capital itself every night; families
were publicly cautioned not to go out of town without removing their
furniture to upholsterers’ warehouses for security; the highwayman in
the dark was a City tradesman in the light, and, being recognised and
challenged by his fellow-tradesman whom he stopped in his character of
“the Captain,” gallantly shot him through the head and rode away; the
mall was waylaid by seven robbers, and the guard shot three dead, and
then got shot dead himself by the other four, “in consequence of the failure of his ammunition:” after which the mall was robbed in peace; that
magnificent potentate, the Lord Mayor of London, was made to stand
and deliver on Turnham Green, by one highwayman, who despoiled the
illustrious creature in sight of all his retinue; prisoners in London gaols
fought battles with their turnkeys, and the majesty of the law fired blunderbusses in among them, loaded with rounds of shot and ball; thieves
snipped off diamond crosses from the necks of noble lords at Court
drawing-rooms; musketeers went into St. Giles’s, to search for contraband goods, and the mob fired on the musketeers, and the musketeers
fired on the mob, and nobody thought any of these occurrences much
out of the common way. In the midst of them, the hangman, ever busy
and ever worse than useless, was in constant requisition; now, stringing
up long rows of miscellaneous criminals; now, hanging a housebreaker
on Saturday who had been taken on Tuesday; now, burning people in
the hand at Newgate by the dozen, and now burning pamphlets at the
5
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
door of Westminster Hall; to-day, taking the life of an atrocious murderer, and to-morrow of a wretched pilferer who had robbed a farmer’s
boy of sixpence.
All these things, and a thousand like them, came to pass in and
close upon the dear old year one thousand seven hundred and seventyfive. Environed by them, while the Woodman and the Farmer worked
unheeded, those two of the large jaws, and those other two of the plain
and the fair faces, trod with stir enough, and carried their divine rights
with a high hand. Thus did the year one thousand seven hundred and
seventy-five conduct their Greatnesses, and myriads of small creatures—
the creatures of this chronicle among the rest—along the roads that lay
before them.
Chapter 2
The Mail
It was the Dover road that lay, on a Friday night late in November,
before the first of the persons with whom this history has business. The
Dover road lay, as to him, beyond the Dover mail, as it lumbered up
Shooter’s Hill. He walked up hill in the mire by the side of the mail, as
the rest of the passengers did; not because they had the least relish for
walking exercise, under the circumstances, but because the hill, and the
harness, and the mud, and the mail, were all so heavy, that the horses
had three times already come to a stop, besides once drawing the coach
across the road, with the mutinous intent of taking it back to Blackheath.
Reins and whip and coachman and guard, however, in combination,
had read that article of war which forbade a purpose otherwise strongly
in favour of the argument, that some brute animals are endued with
Reason; and the team had capitulated and returned to their duty.
With drooping heads and tremulous tails, they mashed their way
through the thick mud, floundering and stumbling between whiles, as
if they were falling to pieces at the larger joints. As often as the driver
rested them and brought them to a stand, with a wary “Wo-ho! so-hothen!” the near leader violently shook his head and everything upon it—
like an unusually emphatic horse, denying that the coach could be got
up the hill. Whenever the leader made this rattle, the passenger started,
as a nervous passenger might, and was disturbed in mind.
6
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
There was a steaming mist in all the hollows, and it had roamed in
its forlornness up the hill, like an evil spirit, seeking rest and finding
none. A clammy and intensely cold mist, it made its slow way through
the air in ripples that visibly followed and overspread one another, as
the waves of an unwholesome sea might do. It was dense enough to
shut out everything from the light of the coach-lamps but these its own
workings, and a few yards of road; and the reek of the labouring horses
steamed into it, as if they had made it all.
Two other passengers, besides the one, were plodding up the hill by
the side of the mail. All three were wrapped to the cheekbones and over
the ears, and wore jack-boots. Not one of the three could have said,
from anything he saw, what either of the other two was like; and each
was hidden under almost as many wrappers from the eyes of the mind,
as from the eyes of the body, of his two companions. In those days, travellers were very shy of being confidential on a short notice, for anybody
on the road might be a robber or in league with robbers. As to the latter, when every posting-house and ale-house could produce somebody
in “the Captain’s” pay, ranging from the landlord to the lowest stable
non-descript, it was the likeliest thing upon the cards. So the guard of
the Dover mail thought to himself, that Friday night in November, one
thousand seven hundred and seventy-five, lumbering up Shooter’s Hill,
as he stood on his own particular perch behind the mail, beating his feet,
and keeping an eye and a hand on the arm-chest before him, where a
loaded blunderbuss lay at the top of six or eight loaded horse-pistols,
deposited on a substratum of cutlass.
The Dover mail was in its usual genial position that the guard suspected the passengers, the passengers suspected one another and the
guard, they all suspected everybody else, and the coachman was sure
of nothing but the horses; as to which cattle he could with a clear conscience have taken his oath on the two Testaments that they were not fit
for the journey.
“Wo-ho!” said the coachman. “So, then! One more pull and you’re
at the top and be damned to you, for I have had trouble enough to get
you to it!—Joe!”
“Halloa!” the guard replied.
“What o’clock do you make it, Joe?”
“Ten minutes, good, past eleven.”
“My blood!” ejaculated the vexed coachman, “and not atop of
Shooter’s yet! Tst! Yah! Get on with you!”
7
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
The emphatic horse, cut short by the whip in a most decided negative, made a decided scramble for it, and the three other horses followed
suit. Once more, the Dover mail struggled on, with the jack-boots of
its passengers squashing along by its side. They had stopped when the
coach stopped, and they kept close company with it. If any one of the
three had had the hardihood to propose to another to walk on a little
ahead into the mist and darkness, he would have put himself in a fair
way of getting shot instantly as a highwayman.
The last burst carried the mail to the summit of the hill. The horses
stopped to breathe again, and the guard got down to skid the wheel for
the descent, and open the coach-door to let the passengers in.
“Tst! Joe!” cried the coachman in a warning voice, looking down
from his box.
“What do you say, Tom?”
They both listened.
“I say a horse at a canter coming up, Joe.”
“I say a horse at a gallop, Tom,” returned the guard, leaving his
hold of the door, and mounting nimbly to his place. “Gentlemen! In the
kings name, all of you!”
With this hurried adjuration, he cocked his blunderbuss, and stood
on the offensive.
The passenger booked by this history, was on the coach-step, getting in; the two other passengers were close behind him, and about to
follow. He remained on the step, half in the coach and half out of;
they re-mained in the road below him. They all looked from the coachman to the guard, and from the guard to the coachman, and listened.
The coachman looked back and the guard looked back, and even the
emphatic leader pricked up his ears and looked back, without contradicting.
The stillness consequent on the cessation of the rumbling and labouring of the coach, added to the stillness of the night, made it very quiet
indeed. The panting of the horses communicated a tremulous motion
to the coach, as if it were in a state of agitation. The hearts of the passengers beat loud enough perhaps to be heard; but at any rate, the quiet
pause was audibly expressive of people out of breath, and holding the
breath, and having the pulses quickened by expectation.
The sound of a horse at a gallop came fast and furiously up the hill.
“So-ho!” the guard sang out, as loud as he could roar. “Yo there!
Stand! I shall fire!”
8
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
The pace was suddenly checked, and, with much splashing and floundering, a man’s voice called from the mist, “Is that the Dover mail?”
“Never you mind what it is!” the guard retorted. “What are you?”
“Is that the Dover mail?”
“Why do you want to know?”
“I want a passenger, if it is.”
“What passenger?”
“Mr. Jarvis Lorry.”
Our booked passenger showed in a moment that it was his name.
The guard, the coachman, and the two other passengers eyed him distrustfully.
“Keep where you are,” the guard called to the voice in the mist,
“because, if I should make a mistake, it could never be set right in your
lifetime. Gentleman of the name of Lorry answer straight.”
“What is the matter?” asked the passenger, then, with mildly quavering speech. “Who wants me? Is it Jerry?”
(“I don’t like Jerry’s voice, if it is Jerry,” growled the guard to himself.
“He’s hoarser than suits me, is Jerry.”)
“Yes, Mr. Lorry.”
“What is the matter?”
“A despatch sent after you from over yonder. T. and Co.”
“I know this messenger, guard,” said Mr. Lorry, getting down into
the road—assisted from behind more swiftly than politely by the other
two passengers, who immediately scrambled into the coach, shut the
door, and pulled up the window. “He may come close; there’s nothing
wrong.”
“I hope there ain’t, but I can’t make so ’Nation sure of that,” said
the guard, in gruff soliloquy. “Hallo you!”
“Well! And hallo you!” said Jerry, more hoarsely than before.
“Come on at a footpace! d’ye mind me? And if you’ve got holsters
to that saddle o’ yourn, don’t let me see your hand go nigh ’em. For I’m
a devil at a quick mistake, and when I make one it takes the form of
Lead. So now let’s look at you.”
The figures of a horse and rider came slowly through the eddying
mist, and came to the side of the mail, where the passenger stood. The
rider stooped, and, casting up his eyes at the guard, handed the passenger a small folded paper. The rider’s horse was blown, and both horse
and rider were covered with mud, from the hoofs of the horse to the hat
of the man.
9
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
“Guard!” said the passenger, in a tone of quiet business confidence.
The watchful guard, with his right hand at the stock of his raised
blunderbuss, his left at the barrel, and his eye on the horseman, answered curtly, “Sir.”
“There is nothing to apprehend. I belong to Tellson’s Bank. You
must know Tellson’s Bank in London. I am going to Paris on business.
A crown to drink. I may read this?”
“If so be as you’re quick, sir.”
He opened it in the light of the coach-lamp on that side, and read—
first to himself and then aloud: “ ‘Wait at Dover for Mam’selle.’ It’s not
long, you see, guard. Jerry, say that my answer was, recalled to life.”
Jerry started in his saddle. “That’s a Blazing strange answer, too,”
said he, at his hoarsest.
“Take that message back, and they will know that I received this, as
well as if I wrote. Make the best of your way. Good night.”
With those words the passenger opened the coach-door and got in;
not at all assisted by his fellow-passengers, who had expeditiously secreted their watches and purses in their boots, and were now making a
general pretence of being asleep. With no more definite purpose than to
escape the hazard of originating any other kind of action.
The coach lumbered on again, with heavier wreaths of mist closing
round it as it began the descent. The guard soon replaced his blunderbuss in his arm-chest, and, having looked to the rest of its contents,
and having looked to the supplementary pistols that he wore in his belt,
looked to a smaller chest beneath his seat, in which there were a few
smith’s tools, a couple of torches, and a tinder-box. For he was furnished with that completeness that if the coach-lamps had been blown
and stormed out, which did occasionally happen, he had only to shut
himself up inside, keep the flint and steel sparks well off the straw, and
get a light with tolerable safety and ease (if he were lucky) in five minutes.
“Tom!” softly over the coach roof.
“Hallo, Joe.”
“Did you hear the message?”
“I did, Joe.”
“What did you make of it, Tom?”
“Nothing at all, Joe.”
“That’s a coincidence, too,” the guard mused, “for I made the same
of it myself.”
10
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
Jerry, left alone in the mist and darkness, dismounted meanwhile,
not only to ease his spent horse, but to wipe the mud from his face, and
shake the wet out of his hat-brim, which might be capable of holding
about half a gallon. After standing with the bridle over his heavilysplashed arm, until the wheels of the mail were no longer within hearing
and the night was quite still again, he turned to walk down the hill.
“After that there gallop from Temple Bar, old lady, I won’t trust your
fore-legs till I get you on the level,” said this hoarse messenger, glancing
at his mare. “ ‘Recalled to life.’ That’s a Blazing strange message. Much
of that wouldn’t do for you, Jerry! I say, Jerry! You’d be in a Blazing
bad way, if recalling to life was to come into fashion, Jerry!”
Chapter 3
The Night Shadows
A wonderful fact to reflect upon, that every human creature is constituted to be that profound secret and mystery to every other. A solemn
consideration, when I enter a great city by night, that every one of those
darkly clustered houses encloses its own secret; that every room in every
one of them encloses its own secret; that every beating heart in the hundreds of thousands of breasts there, is, in some of its imaginings, a secret
to the heart nearest it! Something of the awfulness, even of Death itself,
is referable to this. No more can I turn the leaves of this dear book that
I loved, and vainly hope in time to read it all. No more can I look into
the depths of this unfathomable water, wherein, as momentary lights
glanced into it, I have had glimpses of buried treasure and other things
submerged. It was appointed that the book should shut with a spring,
for ever and for ever, when I had read but a page. It was appointed that
the water should be locked in an eternal frost, when the light was playing on its surface, and I stood in ignorance on the shore. My friend is
dead, my neighbour is dead, my love, the darling of my soul, is dead; it
is the inexorable consolidation and perpetuation of the secret that was
always in that individuality, and which I shall carry in mine to my life’s
end. In any of the burial-places of this city through which I pass, is
there a sleeper more inscrutable than its busy inhabitants are, in their
innermost personality, to me, or than I am to them?
11
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
As to this, his natural and not to be alienated inheritance, the messenger on horseback had exactly the same possessions as the King, the
first Minister of State, or the richest merchant in London. So with the
three passengers shut up in the narrow compass of one lumbering old
mail coach; they were mysteries to one another, as complete as if each
had been in his own coach and six, or his own coach and sixty, with the
breadth of a county between him and the next.
The messenger rode back at an easy trot, stopping pretty often at
ale-houses by the way to drink, but evincing a tendency to keep his
own counsel, and to keep his hat cocked over his eyes. He had eyes
that assorted very well with that decoration, being of a surface black,
with no depth in the colour or form, and much too near together—as
if they were afraid of being found out in something, singly, if they kept
too far apart. They had a sinister expression, under an old cocked-hat
like a three-cornered spittoon, and over a great muffler for the chin and
throat, which descended nearly to the wearer’s knees. When he stopped
for drink, he moved this muffler with his left hand, only while he poured
his liquor in with his right; as soon as that was done, he muffled again.
“No, Jerry, no!” said the messenger, harping on one theme as he
rode. “It wouldn’t do for you, Jerry. Jerry, you honest tradesman, it
wouldn’t suit your line of business! Recalled—! Bust me if I don’t think
he’d been a drinking!”
His message perplexed his mind to that degree that he was fain, several times, to take off his hat to scratch his head. Except on the crown,
which was raggedly bald, he had stiff, black hair, standing jaggedly all
over it, and growing down hill almost to his broad, blunt nose. It was
so like Smith’s work, so much more like the top of a strongly spiked
wall than a head of hair, that the best of players at leap-frog might have
declined him, as the most dangerous man in the world to go over.
While he trotted back with the message he was to deliver to the
night watchman in his box at the door of Tellson’s Bank, by Temple Bar,
who was to deliver it to greater authorities within, the shadows of the
night took such shapes to him as arose out of the message, and took
such shapes to the mare as arose out of her private topics of uneasiness.
They seemed to be numerous, for she shied at every shadow on the road.
What time, the mail-coach lumbered, jolted, rattled, and bumped
upon its tedious way, with its three fellow-inscrutables inside. To whom,
likewise, the shadows of the night revealed themselves, in the forms their
dozing eyes and wandering thoughts suggested.
12
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
Tellson’s Bank had a run upon it in the mail. As the bank passenger—
with an arm drawn through the leathern strap, which did what lay in
it to keep him from pounding against the next passenger, and driving
him into his corner, whenever the coach got a special jolt—nodded in
his place, with half-shut eyes, the little coach-windows, and the coachlamp dimly gleaming through them, and the bulky bundle of opposite
passenger, became the bank, and did a great stroke of business. The
rattle of the harness was the chink of money, and more drafts were
honoured in five minutes than even Tellson’s, with all its foreign and
home connection, ever paid in thrice the time. Then the strong-rooms
underground, at Tellson’s, with such of their valuable stores and secrets
as were known to the passenger (and it was not a little that he knew
about them), opened before him, and he went in among them with the
great keys and the feebly-burning candle, and found them safe, and
strong, and sound, and still, just as he had last seen them.
But, though the bank was almost always with him, and though the
coach (in a confused way, like the presence of pain under an opiate) was
always with him, there was another current of impression that never
ceased to run, all through the night. He was on his way to dig some one
out of a grave.
Now, which of the multitude of faces that showed themselves before
him was the true face of the buried person, the shadows of the night did
not indicate; but they were all the faces of a man of five-and-forty by
years, and they differed principally in the passions they expressed, and
in the ghastliness of their worn and wasted state. Pride, contempt, defiance, stubbornness, submission, lamentation, succeeded one another;
so did varieties of sunken cheek, cadaverous colour, emaciated hands
and figures. But the face was in the main one face, and every head was
prematurely white. A hundred times the dozing passenger inquired of
this spectre:
“Buried how long?”
The answer was always the same: “Almost eighteen years.”
“You had abandoned all hope of being dug out?”
“Long ago.”
“You know that you are recalled to life?”
“They tell me so.”
“I hope you care to live?”
“I can’t say.”
“Shall I show her to you? Will you come and see her?”
13
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
The answers to this question were various and contradictory. Sometimes the broken reply was, “Wait! It would kill me if I saw her too
soon.” Sometimes, it was given in a tender rain of tears, and then it
was, “Take me to her.” Sometimes it was staring and bewildered, and
then it was, “I don’t know her. I don’t understand.”
After such imaginary discourse, the passenger in his fancy would
dig, and dig, dig—now with a spade, now with a great key, now with
his hands—to dig this wretched creature out. Got out at last, with earth
hanging about his face and hair, he would suddenly fan away to dust.
The passenger would then start to himself, and lower the window, to
get the reality of mist and rain on his cheek.
Yet even when his eyes were opened on the mist and rain, on the
moving patch of light from the lamps, and the hedge at the roadside
retreating by jerks, the night shadows outside the coach would fall into
the train of the night shadows within. The real Banking-house by Temple Bar, the real business of the past day, the real strong rooms, the
real express sent after him, and the real message returned, would all be
there. Out of the midst of them, the ghostly face would rise, and he
would accost it again.
“Buried how long?”
“Almost eighteen years.”
“I hope you care to live?”
“I can’t say.”
Dig—dig—dig—until an impatient movement from one of the two
passengers would admonish him to pull up the window, draw his arm
securely through the leathern strap, and speculate upon the two slumbering forms, until his mind lost its hold of them, and they again slid
away into the bank and the grave.
“Buried how long?”
“Almost eighteen years.”
“You had abandoned all hope of being dug out?”
“Long ago.”
The words were still in his hearing as just spoken—distinctly in his
hearing as ever spoken words had been in his life—when the weary
passenger started to the consciousness of daylight, and found that the
shadows of the night were gone.
He lowered the window, and looked out at the rising sun. There was
a ridge of ploughed land, with a plough upon it where it had been left
last night when the horses were unyoked; beyond, a quiet coppice-wood,
14
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
in which many leaves of burning red and golden yellow still remained
upon the trees. Though the earth was cold and wet, the sky was clear,
and the sun rose bright, placid, and beautiful.
“Eighteen years!” said the passenger, looking at the sun. “Gracious
Creator of day! To be buried alive for eighteen years!”
Chapter 4
The Preparation
When the mail got successfully to Dover, in the course of the forenoon,
the head drawer at the Royal George Hotel opened the coach-door as
his custom was. He did it with some flourish of ceremony, for a mail
journey from London in winter was an achievement to congratulate an
adventurous traveller upon.
By that time, there was only one adventurous traveller left be congratulated: for the two others had been set down at their respective
roadside destinations. The mildewy inside of the coach, with its damp
and dirty straw, its disageeable smell, and its obscurity, was rather like
a larger dog-kennel. Mr. Lorry, the passenger, shaking himself out of it
in chains of straw, a tangle of shaggy wrapper, flapping hat, and muddy
legs, was rather like a larger sort of dog.
“There will be a packet to Calais, tomorrow, drawer?”
“Yes, sir, if the weather holds and the wind sets tolerable fair. The
tide will serve pretty nicely at about two in the afternoon, sir. Bed, sir?”
“I shall not go to bed till night; but I want a bedroom, and a barber.”
“And then breakfast, sir? Yes, sir. That way, sir, if you please. Show
Concord! Gentleman’s valise and hot water to Concord. Pull off gentleman’s boots in Concord. (You will find a fine sea-coal fire, sir.) Fetch
barber to Concord. Stir about there, now, for Concord!”
The Concord bed-chamber being always assigned to a passenger by
the mail, and passengers by the mail being always heavily wrapped up
from head to foot, the room had the odd interest for the establishment
of the Royal George, that although but one kind of man was seen to go
into it, all kinds and varieties of men came out of it. Consequently, another drawer, and two porters, and several maids and the landlady, were
all loitering by accident at various points of the road between the Concord and the coffee-room, when a gentleman of sixty, formally dressed
15
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
in a brown suit of clothes, pretty well worn, but very well kept, with
large square cuffs and large flaps to the pockets, passed along on his
way to his breakfast.
The coffee-room had no other occupant, that forenoon, than the
gentleman in brown. His breakfast-table was drawn before the fire, and
as he sat, with its light shining on him, waiting for the meal, he sat so
still, that he might have been sitting for his portrait.
Very orderly and methodical he looked, with a hand on each knee,
and a loud watch ticking a sonorous sermon under his flapped waistcoat, as though it pitted its gravity and longevity against the levity and
evanescence of the brisk fire. He had a good leg, and was a little vain
of it, for his brown stockings fitted sleek and close, and were of a fine
texture; his shoes and buckles, too, though plain, were trim. He wore
an odd little sleek crisp flaxen wig, setting very close to his head: which
wig, it is to be presumed, was made of hair, but which looked far more
as though it were spun from filaments of silk or glass. His linen, though
not of a fineness in accordance with his stockings, was as white as the
tops of the waves that broke upon the neighbouring beach, or the specks
of sail that glinted in the sunlight far at sea. A face habitually suppressed
and quieted, was still lighted up under the quaint wig by a pair of moist
bright eyes that it must have cost their owner, in years gone by, some
pains to drill to the composed and reserved expression of Tellson’s Bank.
He had a healthy colour in his cheeks, and his face, though lined, bore
few traces of anxiety. But, perhaps the confidential bachelor clerks in
Tellson’s Bank were principally occupied with the cares of other people;
and perhaps second-hand cares, like second-hand clothes, come easily
off and on.
Completing his resemblance to a man who was sitting for his portrait, Mr. Lorry dropped off to sleep. The arrival of his breakfast roused
him, and he said to the drawer, as he moved his chair to it:
“I wish accommodation prepared for a young lady who may come
here at any time to-day. She may ask for Mr. Jarvis Lorry, or she may
only ask for a gentleman from Tellson’s Bank. Please to let me know.”
“Yes, sir. Tellson’s Bank in London, sir?”
“Yes.”
“Yes, sir. We have oftentimes the honour to entertain your gentlemen in their travelling backwards and forwards betwixt London and
Paris, sir. A vast deal of travelling, sir, in Tellson and Company’s
House.”
16
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
“Yes. We are quite a French House, as well as an English one.”
“Yes, sir. Not much in the habit of such travelling yourself, I think,
sir?”
“Not of late years. It is fifteen years since we—since I—came last
from France.”
“Indeed, sir? That was before my time here, sir. Before our people’s
time here, sir. The George was in other hands at that time, sir.”
“I believe so.”
“But I would hold a pretty wager, sir, that a House like Tellson and
Company was flourishing, a matter of fifty, not to speak of fifteen years
ago?”
“You might treble that, and say a hundred and fifty, yet not be far
from the truth.”
“Indeed, sir!”
Rounding his mouth and both his eyes, as he stepped backward
from the table, the waiter shifted his napkin from his right arm to his
left, dropped into a comfortable attitude, and stood surveying the guest
while he ate and drank, as from an observatory or watchtower. According to the immemorial usage of waiters in all ages.
When Mr. Lorry had finished his breakfast, he went out for a stroll
on the beach. The little narrow, crooked town of Dover hid itself away
from the beach, and ran its head into the chalk cliffs, like a marine ostrich. The beach was a desert of heaps of sea and stones tumbling wildly
about, and the sea did what it liked, and what it liked was destruction.
It thundered at the town, and thundered at the cliffs, and brought the
coast down, madly. The air among the houses was of so strong a piscatory flavour that one might have supposed sick fish went up to be dipped
in it, as sick people went down to be dipped in the sea. A little fishing
was done in the port, and a quantity of strolling about by night, and
looking seaward: particularly at those times when the tide made, and
was near flood. Small tradesmen, who did no business whatever, sometimes unaccountably realised large fortunes, and it was remarkable that
nobody in the neighbourhood could endure a lamplighter.
As the day declined into the afternoon, and the air, which had been
at intervals clear enough to allow the French coast to be seen, became
again charged with mist and vapour, Mr. Lorry’s thoughts seemed to
cloud too. When it was dark, and he sat before the coffee-room fire,
awaiting his dinner as he had awaited his breakfast, his mind was busily
digging, digging, digging, in the live red coals.
17
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
A bottle of good claret after dinner does a digger in the red coals no
harm, otherwise than as it has a tendency to throw him out of work.
Mr. Lorry had been idle a long time, and had just poured out his last
glassful of wine with as complete an appearance of satisfaction as is ever
to be found in an elderly gentleman of a fresh complexion who has got
to the end of a bottle, when a rattling of wheels came up the narrow
street, and rumbled into the inn-yard.
He set down his glass untouched. “This is Mam’selle!” said he.
In a very few minutes the waiter came in to announce that Miss
Manette had arrived from London, and would be happy to see the gentleman from Tellson’s.
“So soon?”
Miss Manette had taken some refreshment on the road, and required
none then, and was extremely anxious to see the gentleman from Tellson’s immediately, if it suited his pleasure and convenience.
The gentleman from Tellson’s had nothing left for it but to empty
his glass with an air of stolid desperation, settle his odd little flaxen wig
at the ears, and follow the waiter to Miss Manette’s apartment. It was a
large, dark room, furnished in a funereal manner with black horsehair,
and loaded with heavy dark tables. These had been oiled and oiled,
until the two tall candles on the table in the middle of the room were
gloomily reflected on every leaf; as if they were buried, in deep graves of
black mahogany, and no light to speak of could be expected from them
until they were dug out.
The obscurity was so difficult to penetrate that Mr. Lorry, picking
his way over the well-worn Turkey carpet, supposed
Miss Manette to be, for the moment, in some adjacent room, until,
having got past the two tall candles, he saw standing to receive him
by the table between them and the fire, a young lady of not more than
seventeen, in a riding-cloak, and still holding her straw travelling-hat by
its ribbon in her hand. As his eyes rested on a short, slight, pretty figure,
a quantity of golden hair, a pair of blue eyes that met his own with an
inquiring look, and a forehead with a singular capacity (remembering
how young and smooth it was), of rifting and knitting itself into an
expression that was not quite one of perplexity, or wonder, or alarm,
or merely of a bright fixed attention, though it included all the four
expressions-as his eyes rested on these things, a sudden vivid likeness
passed before him, of a child whom he had held in his arms on the
passage across that very Channel, one cold time, when the hail drifted
18
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
heavily and the sea ran high. The likeness passed away, like a breath
along the surface of the gaunt pier-glass behind her, on the frame of
which, a hospital procession of negro cupids, several headless and all
cripples, were offering black baskets of Dead Sea fruit to black divinities
of the feminine gender-and he made his formal bow to Miss Manette.
“Pray take a seat, sir.” In a very clear and pleasant young voice; a
little foreign in its accent, but a very little indeed.
“I kiss your hand, miss,” said Mr. Lorry, with the manners of an
earlier date, as he made his formal bow again, and took his seat.
“I received a letter from the Bank, sir, yesterday, informing me that
some intelligence—or discovery—”
“The word is not material, miss; either word will do.”
“—respecting the small property of my poor father, whom I never
saw—so long dead—”
Mr. Lorry moved in his chair, and cast a troubled look towards the
hospital procession of negro cupids. As if they had any help for anybody
in their absurd baskets!
“—rendered it necessary that I should go to Paris, there to communicate with a gentleman of the Bank, so good as to be despatched to Paris
for the purpose.”
“Myself.”
“As I was prepared to hear, sir.”
She curtseyed to him (young ladies made curtseys in those days),
with a pretty desire to convey to him that she felt how much older and
wiser he was than she. He made her another bow.
“I replied to the Bank, sir, that as it was considered necessary, by
those who know, and who are so kind as to advise me, that I should go
to France, and that as I am an orphan and have no friend who could
go with me, I should esteem it highly if I might be permitted to place
myself, during the journey, under that worthy gentleman’s protection.
The gentleman had left London, but I think a messenger was sent after
him to beg the favour of his waiting for me here.”
“I was happy,” said Mr. Lorry, “to be entrusted with the charge. I
shall be more happy to execute it.”
“Sir, I thank you indeed. I thank you very gratefully. It was told
me by the Bank that the gentleman would explain to me the details of
the business, and that I must prepare myself to find them of a surprising
nature. I have done my best to prepare myself, and I naturally have a
strong and eager interest to know what they are.”
19
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
“Naturally,” said Mr. Lorry. “Yes—I—”
After a pause, he added, again settling the crisp flaxen wig at the
ears, “It is very difficult to begin.”
He did not begin, but, in his indecision, met her glance. The young
forehead lifted itself into that singular expression—but it was pretty
and characteristic, besides being singular—and she raised her hand, as
if with an involuntary action she caught at, or stayed some passing
shadow.
“Are you quite a stranger to me, sir?”
“Am I not?” Mr. Lorry opened his hands, and extended them outwards with an argumentative smile.
Between the eyebrows and just over the little feminine nose, the line
of which was as delicate and fine as it was possible to be, the expression
deepened itself as she took her seat thoughtfully in the chair by which
she had hitherto remained standing. He watched her as she mused, and
the moment she raised her eyes again, went on:
“In your adopted country, I presume, I cannot do better than address
you as a young English lady, Miss Manette?”
“If you please, sir.”
“Miss Manette, I am a man of business. I have a business charge to
acquit myself of. In your reception of it, don’t heed me any more than
if I was a speaking machine-truly, I am not much else. I will, with your
leave, relate to you, miss, the story of one of our customers.”
“Story!”
He seemed wilfully to mistake the word she had repeated, when he
added, in a hurry, “Yes, customers; in the banking business we usually
call our connection our customers. He was a French gentleman; a scientific gentleman; a man of great acquirements—a Doctor.”
“Not of Beauvais?”
“Why, yes, of Beauvais. Like Monsieur Manette, your father, the
gentleman was of Beauvais. Like Monsieur Manette, your father, the
gentleman was of repute in Paris. I had the honour of knowing him
there. Our relations were business relations, but confidential. I was at
that time in our French House, and had been—oh! twenty years.”
“At that time—I may ask, at what time, sir?”
“I speak, miss, of twenty years ago. He married—an English lady—
and I was one of the trustees. His affairs, like the affairs of many other
French gentlemen and French families, were entirely in Tellson’s hands.
In a similar way I am, or I have been, trustee of one kind or other for
20
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
scores of our customers. These are mere business relations, miss; there
is no friendship in them, no particular interest, nothing like sentiment.
I have passed from one to another, in the course of my business life,
just as I pass from one of our customers to another in the course of my
business day; in short, I have no feelings; I am a mere machine. To go
on—”
“But this is my father’s story, sir; and I begin to think”—the curiously roughened forehead was very intent upon him—“that when I was
left an orphan through my mother’s surviving my father only two years,
it was you who brought me to England. I am almost sure it was you.”
Mr. Lorry took the hesitating little hand that confidingly advanced
to take his, and he put it with some ceremony to his lips. He then
conducted the young lady straightway to her chair again, and, holding
the chair-back with his left hand, and using his right by turns to rub his
chin, pull his wig at the ears, or point what he said, stood looking down
into her face while she sat looking up into his.
“Miss Manette, it was I. And you will see how truly I spoke of
myself just now, in saying I had no feelings, and that all the relations
I hold with my fellow-creatures are mere business relations, when you
reflect that I have never seen you since. No; you have been the ward
of Tellson’s House since, and I have been busy with the other business
of Tellson’s House since. Feelings! I have no time for them, no chance
of them. I pass my whole life, miss, in turning an immense pecuniary
Mangle.”
After this odd description of his daily routine of employment, Mr.
Lorry flattened his flaxen wig upon his head with both hands (which
was most unnecessary, for nothing could be flatter than its shining surface was before), and resumed his former attitude.
“So far, miss (as you have remarked), this is the story of your regretted father. Now comes the difference. If your father had not died when
he did—Don’t be frightened! How you start!”
She did, indeed, start. And she caught his wrist with both her hands.
“Pray,” said Mr. Lorry, in a soothing tone, bringing his left hand
from the back of the chair to lay it on the supplicatory fingers that
clasped him in so violent a tremble: “pray control your agitation—a
matter of business. As I was saying—”
Her look so discomposed him that he stopped, wandered, and began
anew:
“As I was saying; if Monsieur Manette had not died; if he had sud21
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
denly and silently disappeared; if he had been spirited away; if it had
not been difficult to guess to what dreadful place, though no art could
trace him; if he had an enemy in some compatriot who could exercise a
privilege that I in my own time have known the boldest people afraid to
speak of in a whisper, across the water there; for instance, the privilege
of filling up blank forms for the consignment of any one to the oblivion
of a prison for any length of time; if his wife had implored the king,
the queen, the court, the clergy, for any tidings of him, and all quite in
vain;—then the history of your father would have been the history of
this unfortunate gentleman, the Doctor of Beauvais.”
“I entreat you to tell me more, sir.”
“I will. I am going to. You can bear it?”
“I can bear anything but the uncertainty you leave me in at this
moment.”
“You speak collectedly, and you—are collected. That’s good!”
(Though his manner was less satisfied than his words.) “A matter of
business. Regard it as a matter of business-business that must be done.
Now if this doctor’s wife, though a lady of great courage and spirit, had
suffered so intensely from this cause before her little child was born—”
“The little child was a daughter, sir.”
“A daughter. A-a-matter of business—don’t be distressed. Miss, if
the poor lady had suffered so intensely before her little child was born,
that she came to the determination of sparing the poor child the inheritance of any part of the agony she had known the pains of, by rearing
her in the belief that her father was dead—No, don’t kneel! In Heaven’s
name why should you kneel to me!”
“For the truth. O dear, good, compassionate sir, for the truth!”
“A-a matter of business. You confuse me, and how can I transact
business if I am confused? Let us be clear-headed. If you could kindly
mention now, for instance, what nine times ninepence are, or how many
shillings in twenty guineas, it would be so encouraging. I should be so
much more at my ease about your state of mind.”
Without directly answering to this appeal, she sat so still when he
had very gently raised her, and the hands that had not ceased to clasp
his wrists were so much more steady than they had been, that she communicated some reassurance to Mr. Jarvis Lorry.
“That’s right, that’s right. Courage! Business! You have business
before you; useful business. Miss Manette, your mother took this course
with you. And when she died—I believe broken-hearted—having never
22
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
slackened her unavailing search for your father, she left you, at two
years old, to grow to be blooming, beautiful, and happy, without the
dark cloud upon you of living in uncertainty whether your father soon
wore his heart out in prison, or wasted there through many lingering
years.”
As he said the words he looked down, with an admiring pity, on the
flowing golden hair; as if he pictured to himself that it might have been
already tinged with grey.
“You know that your parents had no great possession, and that what
they had was secured to your mother and to you. There has been no
new discovery, of money, or of any other property; but—”
He felt his wrist held closer, and he stopped. The expression in the
forehead, which had so particularly attracted his notice, and which was
now immovable, had deepened into one of pain and horror.
“But he has been—been found. He is alive. Greatly changed, it is
too probable; almost a wreck, it is possible; though we will hope the
best. Still, alive. Your father has been taken to the house of an old
servant in Paris, and we are going there: I, to identify him if I can: you,
to restore him to life, love, duty, rest, comfort.”
A shiver ran through her frame, and from it through his. She said,
in a low, distinct, awe-stricken voice, as if she were saying it in a dream,
“I am going to see his Ghost! It will be his Ghost—not him!”
Mr. Lorry quietly chafed the hands that held his arm. “There, there,
there! See now, see now! The best and the worst are known to you,
now. You are well on your way to the poor wronged gentleman, and,
with a fair sea voyage, and a fair land journey, you will be soon at his
dear side.”
She repeated in the same tone, sunk to a whisper, “I have been free,
I have been happy, yet his Ghost has never haunted me!”
“Only one thing more,” said Mr. Lorry, laying stress upon it as a
wholesome means of enforcing her attention: “he has been found under
another name; his own, long forgotten or long concealed. It would be
worse than useless now to inquire which; worse than useless to seek to
know whether he has been for years overlooked, or always designedly
held prisoner. It would be worse than useless now to make any inquiries,
because it would be dangerous. Better not to mention the subject, anywhere or in any way, and to remove him—for a while at all events—out
of France. Even I, safe as an Englishman, and even Tellson’s, important
as they are to French credit, avoid all naming of the matter. I carry
23
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
about me, not a scrap of writing openly referring to it. This is a secret
service altogether. My credentials, entries, and memoranda, are all comprehended in the one line, ‘Recalled to Life;’ which may mean anything.
But what is the matter! She doesn’t notice a word! Miss Manette!”
Perfectly still and silent, and not even fallen back in her chair, she
sat under his hand, utterly insensible; with her eyes open and fixed
upon him, and with that last expression looking as if it were carved
or branded into her forehead. So close was her hold upon his arm, that
he feared to detach himself lest he should hurt her; therefore he called
out loudly for assistance without moving.
A wild-looking woman, whom even in his agitation, Mr. Lorry observed to be all of a red colour, and to have red hair, and to be dressed
in some extraordinary tight-fitting fashion, and to have on her head a
most wonderful bonnet like a Grenadier wooden measure, and good
measure too, or a great Stilton cheese, came running into the room in
advance of the inn servants, and soon settled the question of his detachment from the poor young lady, by laying a brawny hand upon his chest,
and sending him flying back against the nearest wall.
(“I really think this must be a man!” was Mr. Lorry’s breathless
reflection, simultaneously with his coming against the wall.)
“Why, look at you all!” bawled this figure, addressing the inn servants. “Why don’t you go and fetch things, instead of standing there
staring at me? I am not so much to look at, am I? Why don’t you go
and fetch things? I’ll let you know, if you don’t bring smelling-salts,
cold water, and vinegar, quick, I will.”
There was an immediate dispersal for these restoratives, and she
softly laid the patient on a sofa, and tended her with great skill and
gentleness: calling her “my precious!” and “my bird!” and spreading
her golden hair aside over her shoulders with great pride and care.
“And you in brown!” she said, indignantly turning to Mr. Lorry;
“couldn’t you tell her what you had to tell her, without frightening her
to death? Look at her, with her pretty pale face and her cold hands. Do
you call that being a Banker?”
Mr. Lorry was so exceedingly disconcerted by a question so hard to
answer, that he could only look on, at a distance, with much feebler
sympathy and humility, while the strong woman, having banished the
inn servants under the mysterious penalty of “letting them know” something not mentioned if they stayed there, staring, recovered her charge
by a regular series of gradations, and coaxed her to lay her drooping
24
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
head upon her shoulder.
“I hope she will do well now,” said Mr. Lorry.
“No thanks to you in brown, if she does. My darling pretty!”
“I hope,” said Mr. Lorry, after another pause of feeble sympathy and
humility, “that you accompany Miss Manette to France?”
“A likely thing, too!” replied the strong woman. “If it was ever
intended that I should go across salt water, do you suppose Providence
would have cast my lot in an island?”
This being another question hard to answer, Mr. Jarvis Lorry withdrew to consider it.
Chapter 5
The Wine-shop
A large cask of wine had been dropped and broken, in the street. The
accident had happened in getting it out of a cart; the cask had tumbled
out with a run, the hoops had burst, and it lay on the stones just outside
the door of the wine-shop, shattered like a walnut-shell.
All the people within reach had suspended their business, or their
idleness, to run to the spot and drink the wine. The rough, irregular
stones of the street, pointing every way, and designed, one might have
thought, expressly to lame all living creatures that approached them,
had dammed it into little pools; these were surrounded, each by its own
jostling group or crowd, according to its size. Some men kneeled down,
made scoops of their two hands joined, and sipped, or tried to help
women, who bent over their shoulders, to sip, before the wine had all
run out between their fingers. Others, men and women, dipped in the
puddles with little mugs of mutilated earthenware, or even with handkerchiefs from women’s heads, which were squeezed dry into infants’
mouths; others made small mud-embankments, to stem the wine as it
ran; others, directed by lookers-on up at high windows, darted here
and there, to cut off little streams of wine that started away in new directions; others devoted themselves to the sodden and lee-dyed pieces of
the cask, licking, and even champing the moister wine-rotted fragments
with eager relish. There was no drainage to carry off the wine, and
not only did it all get taken up, but so much mud got taken up along
25
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
with it, that there might have been a scavenger in the street, if anybody
acquainted with it could have believed in such a miraculous presence.
A shrill sound of laughter and of amused voices—voices of men,
women, and children—resounded in the street while this wine game
lasted. There was little roughness in the sport, and much playfulness.
There was a special companionship in it, an observable inclination on
the part of every one to join some other one, which led, especially
among the luckier or lighter-hearted, to frolicsome embraces, drinking
of healths, shaking of hands, and even joining of hands and dancing, a
dozen together. When the wine was gone, and the places where it had
been most abundant were raked into a gridiron-pattern by fingers, these
demonstrations ceased, as suddenly as they had broken out. The man
who had left his saw sticking in the firewood he was cutting, set it in
motion again; the women who had left on a door-step the little pot of
hot ashes, at which she had been trying to soften the pain in her own
starved fingers and toes, or in those of her child, returned to it; men
with bare arms, matted locks, and cadaverous faces, who had emerged
into the winter light from cellars, moved away, to descend again; and
a gloom gathered on the scene that appeared more natural to it than
sunshine.
The wine was red wine, and had stained the ground of the narrow
street in the suburb of Saint Antoine, in Paris, where it was spilled. It
had stained many hands, too, and many faces, and many naked feet,
and many wooden shoes. The hands of the man who sawed the wood,
left red marks on the billets; and the forehead of the woman who nursed
her baby, was stained with the stain of the old rag she wound about her
head again. Those who had been greedy with the staves of the cask,
had acquired a tigerish smear about the mouth; and one tall joker so
besmirched, his head more out of a long squalid bag of a nightcap than
in it, scrawled upon a wall with his finger dipped in muddy wine-lees—
blood.
The time was to come, when that wine too would be spilled on the
street-stones, and when the stain of it would be red upon many there.
And now that the cloud settled on Saint Antoine, which a momentary gleam had driven from his sacred countenance, the darkness of it
was heavy-cold, dirt, sickness, ignorance, and want, were the lords in
waiting on the saintly presence-nobles of great power all of them; but,
most especially the last. Samples of a people that had undergone a terrible grinding and regrinding in the mill, and certainly not in the fabulous
26
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
mill which ground old people young, shivered at every corner, passed in
and out at every doorway, looked from every window, fluttered in every
vestige of a garment that the wind shook. The mill which had worked
them down, was the mill that grinds young people old; the children had
ancient faces and grave voices; and upon them, and upon the grown
faces, and ploughed into every furrow of age and coming up afresh,
was the sigh, Hunger. It was prevalent everywhere. Hunger was pushed
out of the tall houses, in the wretched clothing that hung upon poles
and lines; Hunger was patched into them with straw and rag and wood
and paper; Hunger was repeated in every fragment of the small modicum of firewood that the man sawed off; Hunger stared down from the
smokeless chimneys, and started up from the filthy street that had no
offal, among its refuse, of anything to eat. Hunger was the inscription
on the baker’s shelves, written in every small loaf of his scanty stock
of bad bread; at the sausage-shop, in every dead-dog preparation that
was offered for sale. Hunger rattled its dry bones among the roasting
chestnuts in the turned cylinder; Hunger was shred into atomics in every
farthing porringer of husky chips of potato, fried with some reluctant
drops of oil.
Its abiding place was in all things fitted to it. A narrow winding
street, full of offence and stench, with other narrow winding streets
diverging, all peopled by rags and nightcaps, and all smelling of rags
and nightcaps, and all visible things with a brooding look upon them
that looked ill. In the hunted air of the people there was yet some
wild-beast thought of the possibility of turning at bay. Depressed and
slinking though they were, eyes of fire were not wanting among them;
nor compressed lips, white with what they suppressed; nor foreheads
knitted into the likeness of the gallows-rope they mused about enduring, or inflicting. The trade signs (and they were almost as many as the
shops) were, all, grim illustrations of Want. The butcher and the porkman painted up, only the leanest scrags of meat; the baker, the coarsest
of meagre loaves. The people rudely pictured as drinking in the wineshops, croaked over their scanty measures of thin wine and beer, and
were gloweringly confidential together. Nothing was represented in a
flourishing condition, save tools and weapons; but, the cutler’s knives
and axes were sharp and bright, the smith’s hammers were heavy, and
the gunmaker’s stock was murderous. The crippling stones of the pavement, with their many little reservoirs of mud and water, had no footways, but broke off abruptly at the doors. The kennel, to make amends,
27
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
ran down the middle of the street—when it ran at all: which was only after heavy rains, and then it ran, by many eccentric fits, into the houses.
Across the streets, at wide intervals, one clumsy lamp was slung by a
rope and pulley; at night, when the lamplighter had let these down, and
lighted, and hoisted them again, a feeble grove of dim wicks swung in a
sickly manner overhead, as if they were at sea. Indeed they were at sea,
and the ship and crew were in peril of tempest.
For, the time was to come, when the gaunt scarecrows of that region
should have watched the lamplighter, in their idleness and hunger, so
long, as to conceive the idea of improving on his method, and hauling
up men by those ropes and pulleys, to flare upon the darkness of their
condition. But, the time was not come yet; and every wind that blew
over France shook the rags of the scarecrows in vain, for the birds, fine
of song and feather, took no warning.
The wine-shop was a corner shop, better than most others in its appearance and degree, and the master of the wine-shop had stood outside
it, in a yellow waistcoat and green breeches, looking on at the struggle
for the lost wine. “It’s not my affair,” said he, with a final shrug of
the shoulders. “The people from the market did it. Let them bring
another.”
There, his eyes happening to catch the tall joker writing up his joke,
he called to him across the way:
“Say, then, my Gaspard, what do you do there?”
The fellow pointed to his joke with immense significance, as is often
the way with his tribe. It missed its mark, and completely failed, as is
often the way with his tribe too.
“What now? Are you a subject for the mad hospital?” said the wineshop keeper, crossing the road, and obliterating the jest with a handful
of mud, picked up for the purpose, and smeared over it. “Why do you
write in the public streets? Is there—tell me thou—is there no other
place to write such words in?”
In his expostulation he dropped his cleaner hand (perhaps accidentally, perhaps not) upon the joker’s heart. The joker rapped it with
his own, took a nimble spring upward, and came down in a fantastic
dancing attitude, with one of his stained shoes jerked off his foot into
his hand, and held out. A joker of an extremely, not to say wolfishly
practical character, he looked, under those circumstances.
“Put it on, put it on,” said the other. “Call wine, wine; and finish
there.” With that advice, he wiped his soiled hand upon the joker’s
28
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
dress, such as it was—quite deliberately, as having dirtied the hand on
his account; and then recrossed the road and entered the wine-shop.
This wine-shop keeper was a bull-necked, martial-looking man of
thirty, and he should have been of a hot temperament, for, although it
was a bitter day, he wore no coat, but carried one slung over his shoulder.
His shirt-sleeves were rolled up, too, and his brown arms were bare to
the elbows. Neither did he wear anything more on his head than his
own crisply-curling short dark hair. He was a dark man altogether, with
good eyes and a good bold breadth between them. Good-humoured
looking on the whole, but implacable-looking, too; evidently a man of
a strong resolution and a set purpose; a man not desirable to be met,
rushing down a narrow pass with a gulf on either side, for nothing
would turn the man.
Madame Defarge, his wife, sat in the shop behind the counter as he
came in. Madame Defarge was a stout woman of about his own age,
with a watchful eye that seldom seemed to look at anything, a large
hand heavily ringed, a steady face, strong features, and great composure
of manner. There was a character about Madame Defarge, from which
one might have predicated that she did not often make mistakes against
herself in any of the reckonings over which she presided. Madame Defarge being sensitive to cold, was wrapped in fur, and had a quantity
of bright shawl twined about her head, though not to the concealment
of her large earrings. Her knitting was before her, but she had laid
it down to pick her teeth with a toothpick. Thus engaged, with her
right elbow supported by her left hand, Madame Defarge said nothing
when her lord came in, but coughed just one grain of cough. This, in
combination with the lifting of her darkly defined eyebrows over her
toothpick by the breadth of a line, suggested to her husband that he
would do well to look round the shop among the customers, for any
new customer who had dropped in while he stepped over the way.
The wine-shop keeper accordingly rolled his eyes about, until they
rested upon an elderly gentleman and a young lady, who were seated in
a corner. Other company were there: two playing cards, two playing
dominoes, three standing by the counter lengthening out a short supply
of wine. As he passed behind the counter, he took notice that the elderly
gentleman said in a look to the young lady, “This is our man.”
“What the devil do you do in that galley there?” said Monsieur
Defarge to himself; “I don’t know you.”
But, he feigned not to notice the two strangers, and fell into dis29
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
course with the triumvirate of customers who were drinking at the
counter.
“How goes it, Jacques?” said one of these three to Monsieur Defarge. “Is all the spilt wine swallowed?”
“Every drop, Jacques,” answered Monsieur Defarge.
When this interchange of Christian name was effected, Madame Defarge, picking her teeth with her toothpick, coughed another grain of
cough, and raised her eyebrows by the breadth of another line.
“It is not often,” said the second of the three, addressing Monsieur
Defarge, “that many of these miserable beasts know the taste of wine,
or of anything but black bread and death. Is it not so, Jacques?”
“It is so, Jacques,” Monsieur Defarge returned.
At this second interchange of the Christian name, Madame Defarge,
still using her toothpick with profound composure, coughed another
grain of cough, and raised her eyebrows by the breadth of another line.
The last of the three now said his say, as he put down his empty
drinking vessel and smacked his lips.
“Ah! So much the worse! A bitter taste it is that such poor cattle
always have in their mouths, and hard lives they live, Jacques. Am I
right, Jacques?”
“You are right, Jacques,” was the response of Monsieur Defarge.
This third interchange of the Christian name was completed at the
moment when Madame Defarge put her toothpick by, kept her eyebrows up, and slightly rustled in her seat.
“Hold then! True!” muttered her husband. “Gentlemen—my wife!”
The three customers pulled off their hats to Madame Defarge, with
three flourishes. She acknowledged their homage by bending her head,
and giving them a quick look. Then she glanced in a casual manner
round the wine-shop, took up her knitting with great apparent calmness
and repose of spirit, and became absorbed in it.
“Gentlemen,” said her husband, who had kept his bright eye observantly upon her, “good day. The chamber, furnished bachelor-fashion,
that you wished to see, and were inquiring for when I stepped out, is on
the fifth floor. The doorway of the staircase gives on the little courtyard
close to the left here,” pointing with his hand, “near to the window of
my establishment. But, now that I remember, one of you has already
been there, and can show the way. Gentlemen, adieu!”
They paid for their wine, and left the place. The eyes of Monsieur
Defarge were studying his wife at her knitting when the elderly gentle30
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
man advanced from his corner, and begged the favour of a word.
“Willingly, sir,” said Monsieur Defarge, and quietly stepped with
him to the door.
Their conference was very short, but very decided. Almost at the first
word, Monsieur Defarge started and became deeply attentive. It had not
lasted a minute, when he nodded and went out. The gentleman then
beckoned to the young lady, and they, too, went out. Madame Defarge
knitted with nimble fingers and steady eyebrows, and saw nothing.
Mr. Jarvis Lorry and Miss Manette, emerging from the wine-shop
thus, joined Monsieur Defarge in the doorway to which he had directed
his own company just before. It opened from a stinking little black
courtyard, and was the general public entrance to a great pile of houses,
inhabited by a great number of people. In the gloomy tile-paved entry
to the gloomy tile-paved staircase, Monsieur Defarge bent down on one
knee to the child of his old master, and put her hand to his lips. It was a
gentle action, but not at all gently done; a very remarkable transformation had come over him in a few seconds. He had no good-humour in
his face, nor any openness of aspect left, but had become a secret, angry,
dangerous man.
“It is very high; it is a little difficult. Better to begin slowly.” Thus,
Monsieur Defarge, in a stern voice, to Mr. Lorry, as they began ascending the stairs.
“Is he alone?” the latter whispered.
“Alone! God help him, who should be with him!” said the other, in
the same low voice.
“Is he always alone, then?”
“Yes.”
“Of his own desire?”
“Of his own necessity. As he was, when I first saw him after they
found me and demanded to know if I would take him, and, at my peril
be discreet—as he was then, so he is now.”
“He is greatly changed?”
“Changed!”
The keeper of the wine-shop stopped to strike the wall with his hand,
and mutter a tremendous curse. No direct answer could have been half
so forcible. Mr. Lorry’s spirits grew heavier and heavier, as he and his
two companions ascended higher and higher.
Such a staircase, with its accessories, in the older and more crowded
parts of Paris, would be bad enough now; but, at that time, it was vile
31
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
indeed to unaccustomed and unhardened senses. Every little habitation
within the great foul nest of one high building—that is to say, the room
or rooms within every door that opened on the general staircase—left
its own heap of refuse on its own landing, besides flinging other refuse
from its own windows. The uncontrollable and hopeless mass of decomposition so engendered, would have polluted the air, even if poverty and
deprivation had not loaded it with their intangible impurities; the two
bad sources combined made it almost insupportable. Through such
an atmosphere, by a steep dark shaft of dirt and poison, the way lay.
Yielding to his own disturbance of mind, and to his young companion’s
agitation, which became greater every instant, Mr. Jarvis Lorry twice
stopped to rest. Each of these stoppages was made at a doleful grating,
by which any languishing good airs that were left uncorrupted, seemed
to escape, and all spoilt and sickly vapours seemed to crawl in. Through
the rusted bars, tastes, rather than glimpses, were caught of the jumbled
neighbourhood; and nothing within range, nearer or lower than the
summits of the two great towers of Notre-Dame, had any promise on it
of healthy life or wholesome aspirations.
At last, the top of the staircase was gained, and they stopped for the
third time. There was yet an upper staircase, of a steeper inclination
and of contracted dimensions, to be ascended, before the garret story
was reached. The keeper of the wine-shop, always going a little in advance, and always going on the side which Mr. Lorry took, as though
he dreaded to be asked any question by the young lady, turned himself
about here, and, carefully feeling in the pockets of the coat he carried
over his shoulder, took out a key.
“The door is locked then, my friend?” said Mr. Lorry, surprised.
“Ay. Yes,” was the grim reply of Monsieur Defarge.
“You think it necessary to keep the unfortunate gentleman so retired?”
“I think it necessary to turn the key.” Monsieur Defarge whispered
it closer in his ear, and frowned heavily.
“Why?”
“Why! Because he has lived so long, locked up, that he would
be frightened-rave-tear himself to pieces-die-come to I know not what
harm—if his door was left open.”
“Is it possible!” exclaimed Mr. Lorry.
“Is it possible!” repeated Defarge, bitterly. “Yes. And a beautiful
world we live in, when it is possible, and when many other such things
32
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
are possible, and not only possible, but done—done, see you!—under
that sky there, every day. Long live the Devil. Let us go on.”
This dialogue had been held in so very low a whisper, that not a
word of it had reached the young lady’s ears. But, by this time she
trembled under such strong emotion, and her face expressed such deep
anxiety, and, above all, such dread and terror, that Mr. Lorry felt it
incumbent on him to speak a word or two of reassurance.
“Courage, dear miss! Courage! Business! The worst will be over in
a moment; it is but passing the room-door, and the worst is over. Then,
all the good you bring to him, all the relief, all the happiness you bring
to him, begin. Let our good friend here, assist you on that side. That’s
well, friend Defarge. Come, now. Business, business!”
They went up slowly and softly. The staircase was short, and they
were soon at the top. There, as it had an abrupt turn in it, they came
all at once in sight of three men, whose heads were bent down close
together at the side of a door, and who were intently looking into the
room to which the door belonged, through some chinks or holes in
the wall. On hearing footsteps close at hand, these three turned, and
rose, and showed themselves to be the three of one name who had been
drinking in the wine-shop.
“I forgot them in the surprise of your visit,” explained Monsieur
Defarge. “Leave us, good boys; we have business here.”
The three glided by, and went silently down.
There appearing to be no other door on that floor, and the keeper of
the wine-shop going straight to this one when they were left alone, Mr.
Lorry asked him in a whisper, with a little anger:
“Do you make a show of Monsieur Manette?”
“I show him, in the way you have seen, to a chosen few.”
“Is that well?”
“I think it is well.”
“Who are the few? How do you choose them?”
“I choose them as real men, of my name—Jacques is my name—to
whom the sight is likely to do good. Enough; you are English; that is
another thing. Stay there, if you please, a little moment.”
With an admonitory gesture to keep them back, he stooped, and
looked in through the crevice in the wall. Soon raising his head again,
he struck twice or thrice upon the door—evidently with no other object
than to make a noise there. With the same intention, he drew the key
across it, three or four times, before he put it clumsily into the lock, and
33
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
turned it as heavily as he could.
The door slowly opened inward under his hand, and he looked into
the room and said something. A faint voice answered something. Little
more than a single syllable could have been spoken on either side.
He looked back over his shoulder, and beckoned them to enter. Mr.
Lorry got his arm securely round the daughter’s waist, and held her; for
he felt that she was sinking.
“A-a-a-business, business!” he urged, with a moisture that was not
of business shining on his cheek. “Come in, come in!”
“I am afraid of it,” she answered, shuddering.
“Of it? What?”
“I mean of him. Of my father.”
Rendered in a manner desperate, by her state and by the beckoning
of their conductor, he drew over his neck the arm that shook upon his
shoulder, lifted her a little, and hurried her into the room. He sat her
down just within the door, and held her, clinging to him.
Defarge drew out the key, closed the door, locked it on the inside,
took out the key again, and held it in his hand. All this he did, methodically, and with as loud and harsh an accompaniment of noise as he
could make. Finally, he walked across the room with a measured tread
to where the window was. He stopped there, and faced round.
The garret, built to be a depository for firewood and the like, was
dim and dark: for, the window of dormer shape, was in truth a door
in the roof, with a little crane over it for the hoisting up of stores from
the street: unglazed, and closing up the middle in two pieces, like any
other door of French construction. To exclude the cold, one half of
this door was fast closed, and the other was opened but a very little
way. Such a scanty portion of light was admitted through these means,
that it was difficult, on first coming in, to see anything; and long habit
alone could have slowly formed in any one, the ability to do any work
requiring nicety in such obscurity. Yet, work of that kind was being
done in the garret; for, with his back towards the door, and his face
towards the window where the keeper of the wine-shop stood looking
at him, a white-haired man sat on a low bench, stooping forward and
very busy, making shoes.
34
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
Chapter 6
The Shoemaker
“Good day!” said Monsieur Defarge, looking down at the white head
that bent low over the shoemaking.
It was raised for a moment, and a very faint voice responded to the
salutation, as if it were at a distance:
“Good day!”
“You are still hard at work, I see?”
After a long silence, the head was lifted for another moment, and
the voice replied, “Yes—I am working.” This time, a pair of haggard
eyes had looked at the questioner, before the face had dropped again.
The faintness of the voice was pitiable and dreadful. It was not the
faintness of physical weakness, though confinement and hard fare no
doubt had their part in it. Its deplorable peculiarity was, that it was
the faintness of solitude and disuse. It was like the last feeble echo of
a sound made long and long ago. So entirely had it lost the life and
resonance of the human voice, that it affected the senses like a once
beautiful colour faded away into a poor weak stain. So sunken and
suppressed it was, that it was like a voice underground. So expressive it
was, of a hopeless and lost creature, that a famished traveller, wearied
out by lonely wandering in a wilderness, would have remembered home
and friends in such a tone before lying down to die.
Some minutes of silent work had passed: and the haggard eyes had
looked up again: not with any interest or curiosity, but with a dull
mechanical perception, beforehand, that the spot where the only visitor
they were aware of had stood, was not yet empty.
“I want,” said Defarge, who had not removed his gaze from the shoemaker, “to let in a little more light here. You can bear a little more?”
The shoemaker stopped his work; looked with a vacant air of listening, at the floor on one side of him; then similarly, at the floor on the
other side of him; then, upward at the speaker.
“What did you say?”
“You can bear a little more light?”
“I must bear it, if you let it in.” (Laying the palest shadow of a stress
upon the second word.)
The opened half-door was opened a little further, and secured at
that angle for the time. A broad ray of light fell into the garret, and
35
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
showed the workman with an unfinished shoe upon his lap, pausing in
his labour. His few common tools and various scraps of leather were at
his feet and on his bench. He had a white beard, raggedly cut, but not
very long, a hollow face, and exceedingly bright eyes. The hollowness
and thinness of his face would have caused them to look large, under
his yet dark eyebrows and his confused white hair, though they had
been really otherwise; but, they were naturally large, and looked unnaturally so. His yellow rags of shirt lay open at the throat, and showed
his body to be withered and worn. He, and his old canvas frock, and
his loose stockings, and all his poor tatters of clothes, had, in a long
seclusion from direct light and air, faded down to such a dull uniformity of parchment-yellow, that it would have been hard to say which
was which.
He had put up a hand between his eyes and the light, and the very
bones of it seemed transparent. So he sat, with a steadfastly vacant gaze,
pausing in his work. He never looked at the figure before him, without
first looking down on this side of himself, then on that, as if he had lost
the habit of associating place with sound; he never spoke, without first
wandering in this manner, and forgetting to speak.
“Are you going to finish that pair of shoes to-day?” asked Defarge,
motioning to Mr. Lorry to come forward.
“What did you say?”
“Do you mean to finish that pair of shoes to-day?”
“I can’t say that I mean to. I suppose so. I don’t know.”
But, the question reminded him of his work, and he bent over it
again.
Mr. Lorry came silently forward, leaving the daughter by the door.
When he had stood, for a minute or two, by the side of Defarge, the
shoemaker looked up. He showed no surprise at seeing another figure,
but the unsteady fingers of one of his hands strayed to his lips as he
looked at it (his lips and his nails were of the same pale lead-colour),
and then the hand dropped to his work, and he once more bent over the
shoe. The look and the action had occupied but an instant.
“You have a visitor, you see,” said Monsieur Defarge.
“What did you say?”
“Here is a visitor.”
The shoemaker looked up as before, but without removing a hand
from his work.
“Come!” said Defarge. “Here is monsieur, who knows a well-made
36
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
shoe when he sees one. Show him that shoe you are working at. Take
it, monsieur.”
Mr. Lorry took it in his hand.
“Tell monsieur what kind of shoe it is, and the maker’s name.”
There was a longer pause than usual, before the shoemaker replied:
“I forget what it was you asked me. What did you say?”
“I said, couldn’t you describe the kind of shoe, for monsieur’s information?”
“It is a lady’s shoe. It is a young lady’s walking-shoe. It is in the
present mode. I never saw the mode. I have had a pattern in my hand.”
He glanced at the shoe with some little passing touch of pride.
“And the maker’s name?” said Defarge.
Now that he had no work to hold, he laid the knuckles of the right
hand in the hollow of the left, and then the knuckles of the left hand
in the hollow of the right, and then passed a hand across his bearded
chin, and so on in regular changes, without a moment’s intermission.
The task of recalling him from the vagrancy into which he always sank
when he had spoken, was like recalling some very weak person from
a swoon, or endeavouring, in the hope of some disclosure, to stay the
spirit of a fast-dying man.
“Did you ask me for my name?”
“Assuredly I did.”
“One Hundred and Five, North Tower.”
“Is that all?”
“One Hundred and Five, North Tower.”
With a weary sound that was not a sigh, nor a groan, he bent to
work again, until the silence was again broken.
“You are not a shoemaker by trade?” said Mr. Lorry, looking steadfastly at him.
His haggard eyes turned to Defarge as if he would have transferred
the question to him: but as no help came from that quarter, they turned
back on the questioner when they had sought the ground.
“I am not a shoemaker by trade? No, I was not a shoemaker by
trade. I-I learnt it here. I taught myself. I asked leave to—”
He lapsed away, even for minutes, ringing those measured changes
on his hands the whole time. His eyes came slowly back, at last, to the
face from which they had wandered; when they rested on it, he started,
and resumed, in the manner of a sleeper that moment awake, reverting
to a subject of last night.
37
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
“I asked leave to teach myself, and I got it with much difficulty after
a long while, and I have made shoes ever since.”
As he held out his hand for the shoe that had been taken from him,
Mr. Lorry said, still looking steadfastly in his face:
“Monsieur Manette, do you remember nothing of me?”
The shoe dropped to the ground, and he sat looking fixedly at the
questioner.
“Monsieur Manette”; Mr. Lorry laid his hand upon Defarge’s arm;
“do you remember nothing of this man? Look at him. Look at me. Is
there no old banker, no old business, no old servant, no old time, rising
in your mind, Monsieur Manette?”
As the captive of many years sat looking fixedly, by turns, at Mr.
Lorry and at Defarge, some long obliterated marks of an actively intent
intelligence in the middle of the forehead, gradually forced themselves
through the black mist that had fallen on him. They were overclouded
again, they were fainter, they were gone; but they had been there. And
so exactly was the expression repeated on the fair young face of her
who had crept along the wall to a point where she could see him, and
where she now stood looking at him, with hands which at first had been
only raised in frightened compassion, if not even to keep him off and
shut out the sight of him, but which were now extending towards him,
trembling with eagerness to lay the spectral face upon her warm young
breast, and love it back to life and hope—so exactly was the expression
repeated (though in stronger characters) on her fair young face, that it
looked as though it had passed like a moving light, from him to her.
Darkness had fallen on him in its place. He looked at the two,
less and less attentively, and his eyes in gloomy abstraction sought the
ground and looked about him in the old way. Finally, with a deep long
sigh, he took the shoe up, and resumed his work.
“Have you recognised him, monsieur?” asked Defarge in a whisper.
“Yes; for a moment. At first I thought it quite hopeless, but I have
unquestionably seen, for a single moment, the face that I once knew so
well. Hush! Let us draw further back. Hush!”
She had moved from the wall of the garret, very near to the bench on
which he sat. There was something awful in his unconsciousness of the
figure that could have put out its hand and touched him as he stooped
over his labour.
Not a word was spoken, not a sound was made. She stood, like a
spirit, beside him, and he bent over his work.
38
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
It happened, at length, that he had occasion to change the instrument
in his hand, for his shoemaker’s knife. It lay on that side of him which
was not the side on which she stood. He had taken it up, and was
stooping to work again, when his eyes caught the skirt of her dress. He
raised them, and saw her face. The two spectators started forward, but
she stayed them with a motion of her hand. She had no fear of his
striking at her with the knife, though they had.
He stared at her with a fearful look, and after a while his lips began
to form some words, though no sound proceeded from them. By degrees, in the pauses of his quick and laboured breathing, he was heard
to say:
“What is this?”
With the tears streaming down her face, she put her two hands to
her lips, and kissed them to him; then clasped them on her breast, as if
she laid his ruined head there.
“You are not the gaoler’s daughter?”
She sighed “No.”
“Who are you?”
Not yet trusting the tones of her voice, she sat down on the bench
beside him. He recoiled, but she laid her hand upon his arm. A strange
thrill struck him when she did so, and visibly passed over his frame; he
laid the knife down’ softly, as he sat staring at her.
Her golden hair, which she wore in long curls, had been hurriedly
pushed aside, and fell down over her neck. Advancing his hand by little
and little, he took it up and looked at it. In the midst of the action he
went astray, and, with another deep sigh, fell to work at his shoemaking.
But not for long. Releasing his arm, she laid her hand upon his
shoulder. After looking doubtfully at it, two or three times, as if to be
sure that it was really there, he laid down his work, put his hand to his
neck, and took off a blackened string with a scrap of folded rag attached
to it. He opened this, carefully, on his knee, and it contained a very little
quantity of hair: not more than one or two long golden hairs, which he
had, in some old day, wound off upon his finger.
He took her hair into his hand again, and looked closely at it. “It is
the same. How can it be! When was it! How was it!”
As the concentrated expression returned to his forehead, he seemed
to become conscious that it was in hers too. He turned her full to the
light, and looked at her.
“She had laid her head upon my shoulder, that night when I was
39
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
summoned out—she had a fear of my going, though I had none—and
when I was brought to the North Tower they found these upon my
sleeve. ’You will leave me them? They can never help me to escape in
the body, though they may in the spirit.’ Those were the words I said. I
remember them very well.”
He formed this speech with his lips many times before he could utter it. But when he did find spoken words for it, they came to him
coherently, though slowly.
“How was this?—was it you?”
Once more, the two spectators started, as he turned upon her with
a frightful suddenness. But she sat perfectly still in his grasp, and only
said, in a low voice, “I entreat you, good gentlemen, do not come near
us, do not speak, do not move!”
“Hark!” he exclaimed. “Whose voice was that?”
His hands released her as he uttered this cry, and went up to his
white hair, which they tore in a frenzy. It died out, as everything but
his shoemaking did die out of him, and he refolded his little packet and
tried to secure it in his breast; but he still looked at her, and gloomily
shook his head.
“No, no, no; you are too young, too blooming. It can’t be. See what
the prisoner is. These are not the hands she knew, this is not the face
she knew, this is not a voice she ever heard. No, no. She was—and
He was—before the slow years of the North Tower—ages ago. What is
your name, my gentle angel?”
Hailing his softened tone and manner, his daughter fell upon her
knees before him, with her appealing hands upon his breast.
“O, sir, at another time you shall know my name, and who my
mother was, and who my father, and how I never knew their hard, hard
history. But I cannot tell you at this time, and I cannot tell you here. All
that I may tell you, here and now, is, that I pray to you to touch me and
to bless me. Kiss me, kiss me! O my dear, my dear!”
His cold white head mingled with her radiant hair, which warmed
and lighted it as though it were the light of Freedom shining on him.
“If you hear in my voice—I don’t know that it is so, but I hope it is—
if you hear in my voice any resemblance to a voice that once was sweet
music in your ears, weep for it, weep for it! If you touch, in touching
my hair, anything that recalls a beloved head that lay on your breast
when you were young and free, weep for it, weep for it! If, when I hint
to you of a Home that is before us, where I will be true to you with all
40
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
my duty and with all my faithful service, I bring back the remembrance
of a Home long desolate, while your poor heart pined away, weep for
it, weep for it!”
She held him closer round the neck, and rocked him on her breast
like a child.
“If, when I tell you, dearest dear, that your agony is over, and that I
have come here to take you from it, and that we go to England to be at
peace and at rest, I cause you to think of your useful life laid waste, and
of our native France so wicked to you, weep for it, weep for it! And if,
when I shall tell you of my name, and of my father who is living, and of
my mother who is dead, you learn that I have to kneel to my honoured
father, and implore his pardon for having never for his sake striven all
day and lain awake and wept all night, because the love of my poor
mother hid his torture from me, weep for it, weep for it! Weep for her,
then, and for me! Good gentlemen, thank God! I feel his sacred tears
upon my face, and his sobs strike against my heart. O, see! Thank God
for us, thank God!”
He had sunk in her arms, and his face dropped on her breast: a
sight so touching, yet so terrible in the tremendous wrong and suffering
which had gone before it, that the two beholders covered their faces.
When the quiet of the garret had been long undisturbed, and his
heaving breast and shaken form had long yielded to the calm that
must follow all storms—emblem to humanity, of the rest and silence
into which the storm called Life must hush at last—they came forward
to raise the father and daughter from the ground. He had gradually
dropped to the floor, and lay there in a lethargy, worn out. She had
nestled down with him, that his head might lie upon her arm; and her
hair drooping over him curtained him from the light.
“If, without disturbing him,” she said, raising her hand to Mr. Lorry
as he stooped over them, after repeated blowings of his nose, “all could
be arranged for our leaving Paris at once, so that, from the, very door,
he could be taken away—”
“But, consider. Is he fit for the journey?” asked Mr. Lorry.
“More fit for that, I think, than to remain in this city, so dreadful to
him.”
“It is true,” said Defarge, who was kneeling to look on and hear.
“More than that; Monsieur Manette is, for all reasons, best out of
France. Say, shall I hire a carriage and post-horses?”
“That’s business,” said Mr. Lorry, resuming on the shortest notice
41
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
his methodical manners; “and if business is to be done, I had better do
it.”
“Then be so kind,” urged Miss Manette, “as to leave us here. You
see how composed he has become, and you cannot be afraid to leave
him with me now. Why should you be? If you will lock the door to
secure us from interruption, I do not doubt that you will find him, when
you come back, as quiet as you leave him. In any case, I will take care
of him until you return, and then we will remove him straight.”
Both Mr. Lorry and Defarge were rather disinclined to this course,
and in favour of one of them remaining. But, as there were not only
carriage and horses to be seen to, but travelling papers; and as time
pressed, for the day was drawing to an end, it came at last to their hastily
dividing the business that was necessary to be done, and hurrying away
to do it.
Then, as the darkness closed in, the daughter laid her head down
on the hard ground close at the father’s side, and watched him. The
darkness deepened and deepened, and they both lay quiet, until a light
gleamed through the chinks in the wall.
Mr. Lorry and Monsieur Defarge had made all ready for the journey, and had brought with them, besides travelling cloaks and wrappers, bread and meat, wine, and hot coffee. Monsieur Defarge put this
provender, and the lamp he carried, on the shoemaker’s bench (there
was nothing else in the garret but a pallet bed), and he and Mr. Lorry
roused the captive, and assisted him to his feet.
No human intelligence could have read the mysteries of his mind,
in the scared blank wonder of his face. Whether he knew what had
happened, whether he recollected what they had said to him, whether
he knew that he was free, were questions which no sagacity could have
solved. They tried speaking to him; but, he was so confused, and so very
slow to answer, that they took fright at his bewilderment, and agreed
for the time to tamper with him no more. He had a wild, lost manner of occasionally clasping his head in his hands, that had not been
seen in him before; yet, he had some pleasure in the mere sound of his
daughter’s voice, and invariably turned to it when she spoke.
In the submissive way of one long accustomed to obey under coercion, he ate and drank what they gave him to eat and drink, and put on
the cloak and other wrappings, that they gave him to wear. He readily
responded to his daughter’s drawing her arm through his, and took—
and kept—her hand in both his own.
42
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
They began to descend; Monsieur Defarge going first with the lamp,
Mr. Lorry closing the little procession. They had not traversed many
steps of the long main staircase when he stopped, and stared at the roof
and round at the wails.
“You remember the place, my father? You remember coming up
here?”
“What did you say?”
But, before she could repeat the question, he murmured an answer
as if she had repeated it.
“Remember? No, I don’t remember. It was so very long ago.”
That he had no recollection whatever of his having been brought
from his prison to that house, was apparent to them. They heard him
mutter, “One Hundred and Five, North Tower;” and when he looked
about him, it evidently was for the strong fortress-walls which had long
encompassed him. On their reaching the courtyard he instinctively altered his tread, as being in expectation of a drawbridge; and when there
was no drawbridge, and he saw the carriage waiting in the open street,
he dropped his daughter’s hand and clasped his head again.
No crowd was about the door; no people were discernible at any of
the many windows; not even a chance passerby was in the street. An
unnatural silence and desertion reigned there. Only one soul was to be
seen, and that was Madame Defarge—who leaned against the door-post,
knitting, and saw nothing.
The prisoner had got into a coach, and his daughter had followed
him, when Mr. Lorry’s feet were arrested on the step by his asking, miserably, for his shoemaking tools and the unfinished shoes. Madame Defarge immediately called to her husband that she would get them, and
went, knitting, out of the lamplight, through the courtyard. She quickly
brought them down and handed them in;—and immediately afterwards
leaned against the door-post, knitting, and saw nothing.
Defarge got upon the box, and gave the word “To the Barrier!” The
postilion cracked his whip, and they clattered away under the feeble
over-swinging lamps.
Under the over-swinging lamps—swinging ever brighter in the better streets, and ever dimmer in the worse—and by lighted shops, gay
crowds, illuminated coffee-houses, and theatre-doors, to one of the city
gates. Soldiers with lanterns, at the guard-house there. “Your papers,
travellers!” “See here then, Monsieur the Officer,” said Defarge, getting
down, and taking him gravely apart, “these are the papers of monsieur
43
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
inside, with the white head. They were consigned to me, with him, at
the—” He dropped his voice, there was a flutter among the military
lanterns, and one of them being handed into the coach by an arm in
uniform, the eyes connected with the arm looked, not an every day or
an every night look, at monsieur with the white head. “It is well. Forward!” from the uniform. “Adieu!” from Defarge. And so, under a
short grove of feebler and feebler over-swinging lamps, out under the
great grove of stars.
Beneath that arch of unmoved and eternal lights; some, so remote
from this little earth that the learned tell us it is doubtful whether their
rays have even yet discovered it, as a point in space where anything
is suffered or done: the shadows of the night were broad and black.
All through the cold and restless interval, until dawn, they once more
whispered in the ears of Mr. Jarvis Lorry—sitting opposite the buried
man who had been dug out, and wondering what subtle powers were
for ever lost to him, and what were capable of restoration—the old
inquiry:
“I hope you care to be recalled to life?”
And the old answer:
“I can’t say.”

Book the Second
The Golden Thread
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
Chapter 1
Five Years Later
Tellson’s Bank by Temple Bar was an old-fashioned place, even in the
year one thousand seven hundred and eighty. It was very small, very
dark, very ugly, very incommodious. It was an old-fashioned place,
moreover, in the moral attribute that the partners in the House were
proud of its smallness, proud of its darkness, proud of its ugliness,
proud of its incommodiousness. They were even boastful of its eminence in those particulars, and were fired by an express conviction
that, if it were less objectionable, it would be less respectable. This
was no passive belief, but an active weapon which they flashed at more
convenient places of business. Tellson’s (they said) wanted no elbowroom, Tellson’s wanted no light, Tellson’s wanted no embellishment.
Noakes and Co.’s might, or Snooks Brothers’ might; but Tellson’s, thank
Heaven!—
Any one of these partners would have disinherited his son on the
question of rebuilding Tellson’s. In this respect the House was much
on a par with the Country; which did very often disinherit its sons for
suggesting improvements in laws and customs that had long been highly
objectionable, but were only the more respectable.
Thus it had come to pass, that Tellson’s was the triumphant perfection of inconvenience. After bursting open a door of idiotic obstinacy
with a weak rattle in its throat, you fell into Tellson’s down two steps,
and came to your senses in a miserable little shop, with two little counters, where the oldest of men made your cheque shake as if the wind
rustled it, while they examined the signature by the dingiest of windows,
which were always under a shower-bath of mud from Fleet-street, and
which were made the dingier by their own iron bars proper, and the
heavy shadow of Temple Bar. If your business necessitated your seeing
“the House,” you were put into a species of Condemned Hold at the
back, where you meditated on a misspent life, until the House came
with its hands in its pockets, and you could hardly blink at it in the
dismal twilight. Your money came out of, or went into, wormy old
wooden drawers, particles of which flew up your nose and down your
throat when they were opened and shut. Your bank-notes had a musty
odour, as if they were fast decomposing into rags again. Your plate was
stowed away among the neighbouring cesspools, and evil communica46
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
tions corrupted its good polish in a day or two. Your deeds got into
extemporised strong-rooms made of kitchens and sculleries, and fretted
all the fat out of their parchments into the banking-house air. Your
lighter boxes of family papers went up-stairs into a Barmecide room,
that always had a great dining-table in it and never had a dinner, and
where, even in the year one thousand seven hundred and eighty, the first
letters written to you by your old love, or by your little children, were
but newly released from the horror of being ogled through the windows,
by the heads exposed on Temple Bar with an insensate brutality and ferocity worthy of Abyssinia or Ashantee.
But indeed, at that time, putting to death was a recipe much in vogue
with all trades and professions, and not least of all with Tellson’s. Death
is Nature’s remedy for all things, and why not Legislation’s? Accordingly, the forger was put to Death; the utterer of a bad note was put to
Death; the unlawful opener of a letter was put to Death; the purloiner
of forty shillings and sixpence was put to Death; the holder of a horse
at Tellson’s door, who made off with it, was put to Death; the coiner
of a bad shilling was put to Death; the sounders of three-fourths of the
notes in the whole gamut of Crime, were put to Death. Not that it
did the least good in the way of prevention—it might almost have been
worth remarking that the fact was exactly the reverse—but, it cleared
off (as to this world) the trouble of each particular case, and left nothing else connected with it to be looked after. Thus, Tellson’s, in its day,
like greater places of business, its contemporaries, had taken so many
lives, that, if the heads laid low before it had been ranged on Temple
Bar instead of being privately disposed of, they would probably have
excluded what little light the ground floor had, in a rather significant
manner.
Cramped in all kinds of dun cupboards and hutches at Tellson’s,
the oldest of men carried on the business gravely. When they took a
young man into Tellson’s London house, they hid him somewhere till
he was old. They kept him in a dark place, like a cheese, until he had
the full Tellson flavour and blue-mould upon him. Then only was he
permitted to be seen, spectacularly poring over large books, and casting
his breeches and gaiters into the general weight of the establishment.
Outside Tellson’s—never by any means in it, unless called in—was
an odd-job-man, an occasional porter and messenger, who served as
the live sign of the house. He was never absent during business hours,
unless upon an errand, and then he was represented by his son: a grisly
47
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
urchin of twelve, who was his express image. People understood that
Tellson’s, in a stately way, tolerated the odd-job-man. The house had
always tolerated some person in that capacity, and time and tide had
drifted this person to the post. His surname was Cruncher, and on the
youthful occasion of his renouncing by proxy the works of darkness,
in the easterly parish church of Hounsditch, he had received the added
appellation of Jerry.
The scene was Mr. Cruncher’s private lodging in Hanging-swordalley, Whitefriars: the time, half-past seven of the clock on a windy
March morning, Anno Domini seventeen hundred and eighty. (Mr.
Cruncher himself always spoke of the year of our Lord as Anna Dominoes: apparently under the impression that the Christian era dated from
the invention of a popular game, by a lady who had bestowed her name
upon it.)
Mr. Cruncher’s apartments were not in a savoury neighbourhood,
and were but two in number, even if a closet with a single pane of glass
in it might be counted as one. But they were very decently kept. Early
as it was, on the windy March morning, the room in which he lay abed
was already scrubbed throughout; and between the cups and saucers
arranged for breakfast, and the lumbering deal table, a very clean white
cloth was spread.
Mr. Cruncher reposed under a patchwork counterpane, like a
Harlequin at home. At fast, he slept heavily, but, by degrees, began
to roll and surge in bed, until he rose above the surface, with his spiky
hair looking as if it must tear the sheets to ribbons. At which juncture,
he exclaimed, in a voice of dire exasperation:
“Bust me, if she ain’t at it agin!”
A woman of orderly and industrious appearance rose from her knees
in a corner, with sufficient haste and trepidation to show that she was
the person referred to.
“What!” said Mr. Cruncher, looking out of bed for a boot. “You’re
at it agin, are you?”
After hailing the mom with this second salutation, he threw a boot
at the woman as a third. It was a very muddy boot, and may introduce
the odd circumstance connected with Mr. Cruncher’s domestic economy,
that, whereas he often came home after banking hours with clean boots,
he often got up next morning to find the same boots covered with clay.
“What,” said Mr. Cruncher, varying his apostrophe after missing his
mark—“what are you up to, Aggerawayter?”
48
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
“I was only saying my prayers.”
“Saying your prayers! You’re a nice woman! What do you mean by
flopping yourself down and praying agin me?”
“I was not praying against you; I was praying for you.”
“You weren’t. And if you were, I won’t be took the liberty with.
Here! your mother’s a nice woman, young Jerry, going a praying agin
your father’s prosperity. You’ve got a dutiful mother, you have, my son.
You’ve got a religious mother, you have, my boy: going and flopping
herself down, and praying that the bread-and-butter may be snatched
out of the mouth of her only child.”
Master Cruncher (who was in his shirt) took this very ill, and, turning to his mother, strongly deprecated any praying away of his personal
board.
“And what do you suppose, you conceited female,” said Mr.
Cruncher, with unconscious inconsistency, “that the worth of your
prayers may be? Name the price that you put your prayers at!”
“They only come from the heart, Jerry. They are worth no more
than that.”
“Worth no more than that,” repeated Mr. Cruncher. “They ain’t
worth much, then. Whether or no, I won’t be prayed agin, I tell you. I
can’t afford it. I’m not a going to be made unlucky by your sneaking.
If you must go flopping yourself down, flop in favour of your husband
and child, and not in opposition to ’em. If I had had any but a unnat’ral
wife, and this poor boy had had any but a unnat’ral mother, I might
have made some money last week instead of being counter-prayed and
countermined and religiously circumwented into the worst of luck. B-uu-ust me!” said Mr. Cruncher, who all this time had been putting on his
clothes, “if I ain’t, what with piety and one blowed thing and another,
been choused this last week into as bad luck as ever a poor devil of a
honest tradesman met with! Young Jerry, dress yourself, my boy, and
while I clean my boots keep a eye upon your mother now and then, and
if you see any signs of more flopping, give me a call. For, I tell you,”
here he addressed his wife once more, “I won’t be gone agin, in this
manner. I am as rickety as a hackney-coach, I’m as sleepy as laudanum,
my lines is strained to that degree that I shouldn’t know, if it wasn’t
for the pain in ’em, which was me and which somebody else, yet I’m
none the better for it in pocket; and it’s my suspicion that you’ve been
at it from morning to night to prevent me from being the better for it in
pocket, and I won’t put up with it, Aggerawayter, and what do you say
49
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
now!”
Growling, in addition, such phrases as “Ah! yes! You’re religious,
too. You wouldn’t put yourself in opposition to the interests of your
husband and child, would you? Not you!” and throwing off other
sarcastic sparks from the whirling grindstone of his indignation, Mr.
Cruncher betook himself to his boot-cleaning and his general preparation for business. In the meantime, his son, whose head was garnished
with tenderer spikes, and whose young eyes stood close by one another,
as his father’s did, kept the required watch upon his mother. He greatly
disturbed that poor woman at intervals, by darting out of his sleeping
closet, where he made his toilet, with a suppressed cry of “You are going to flop, mother. —Halloa, father!” and, after raising this fictitious
alarm, darting in again with an undutiful grin.
Mr. Cruncher’s temper was not at all improved when he came to
his breakfast. He resented Mrs. Cruncher’s saying grace with particular
animosity.
“Now, Aggerawayter! What are you up to? At it again?”
His wife explained that she had merely “asked a blessing.”
“Don’t do it!” said Mr. Crunches looking about, as if he rather expected to see the loaf disappear under the efficacy of his wife’s petitions.
“I ain’t a going to be blest out of house and home. I won’t have my
wittles blest off my table. Keep still!”
Exceedingly red-eyed and grim, as if he had been up all night at a
party which had taken anything but a convivial turn, Jerry Cruncher
worried his breakfast rather than ate it, growling over it like any fourfooted inmate of a menagerie. Towards nine o’clock he smoothed his
ruffled aspect, and, presenting as respectable and business-like an exterior as he could overlay his natural self with, issued forth to the occupation of the day.
It could scarcely be called a trade, in spite of his favourite description
of himself as “a honest tradesman.” His stock consisted of a wooden
stool, made out of a broken-backed chair cut down, which stool, young
Jerry, walking at his father’s side, carried every morning to beneath the
banking-house window that was nearest Temple Bar: where, with the
addition of the first handful of straw that could be gleaned from any
passing vehicle to keep the cold and wet from the odd-job-man’s feet, it
formed the encampment for the day. On this post of his, Mr. Cruncher
was as well known to Fleet-street and the Temple, as the Bar itself,—and
was almost as in-looking.
50
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
Encamped at a quarter before nine, in good time to touch his threecornered hat to the oldest of men as they passed in to Tellson’s, Jerry
took up his station on this windy March morning, with young Jerry
standing by him, when not engaged in making forays through the Bar,
to inflict bodily and mental injuries of an acute description on passing
boys who were small enough for his amiable purpose. Father and son,
extremely like each other, looking silently on at the morning traffic in
Fleet-street, with their two heads as near to one another as the two eyes
of each were, bore a considerable resemblance to a pair of monkeys.
The resemblance was not lessened by the accidental circumstance, that
the mature Jerry bit and spat out straw, while the twinkling eyes of the
youthful Jerry were as restlessly watchful of him as of everything else in
Fleet-street.
The head of one of the regular indoor messengers attached to Tellson’s establishment was put through the door, and the word was given:
“Porter wanted!”
“Hooray, father! Here’s an early job to begin with!”
Having thus given his parent God speed, young Jerry seated himself
on the stool, entered on his reversionary interest in the straw his father
had been chewing, and cogitated.
“Al-ways rusty! His fingers is al-ways rusty!” muttered young Jerry.
“Where does my father get all that iron rust from? He don’t get no iron
rust here!”
Chapter 2
A Sight
“You know the Old Bailey, well, no doubt?” said one of the oldest of
clerks to Jerry the messenger.
“Ye-es, sir,” returned Jerry, in something of a dogged manner. “I do
know the Bailey.”
“Just so. And you know Mr. Lorry.”
“I know Mr. Lorry, sir, much better than I know the Bailey. Much
better,” said Jerry, not unlike a reluctant witness at the establishment in
question, “than I, as a honest tradesman, wish to know the Bailey.”
“Very well. Find the door where the witnesses go in, and show the
door-keeper this note for Mr. Lorry. He will then let you in.”
51
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
“Into the court, sir?”
“Into the court.”
Mr. Cruncher’s eyes seemed to get a little closer to one another, and
to interchange the inquiry, “What do you think of this?”
“Am I to wait in the court, sir?” he asked, as the result of that
conference.
“I am going to tell you. The door-keeper will pass the note to Mr.
Lorry, and do you make any gesture that will attract Mr. Lorry’s attention, and show him where you stand. Then what you have to do, is, to
remain there until he wants you.”
“Is that all, sir?”
“That’s all. He wishes to have a messenger at hand. This is to tell
him you are there.”
As the ancient clerk deliberately folded and superscribed the note,
Mr. Cruncher, after surveying him in silence until he came to the
blotting-paper stage, remarked:
“I suppose they’ll be trying Forgeries this morning?”
“Treason!”
“That’s quartering,” said Jerry. “Barbarous!”
“It is the law,” remarked the ancient clerk, turning his surprised
spectacles upon him. “It is the law.”
“It’s hard in the law to spile a man, I think. Ifs hard enough to kill
him, but it’s wery hard to spile him, sir.”
“Not at all,” retained the ancient clerk. “Speak well of the law. Take
care of your chest and voice, my good friend, and leave the law to take
care of itself. I give you that advice.”
“It’s the damp, sir, what settles on my chest and voice,” said Jerry.
“I leave you to judge what a damp way of earning a living mine is.”
“Well, well,” said the old clerk; “we all have our various ways of
gaining a livelihood. Some of us have damp ways, and some of us have
dry ways. Here is the letter. Go along.”
Jerry took the letter, and, remarking to himself with less internal
deference than he made an outward show of, “You are a lean old one,
too,” made his bow, informed his son, in passing, of his destination, and
went his way.
They hanged at Tyburn, in those days, so the street outside Newgate
had not obtained one infamous notoriety that has since attached to it.
But, the gaol was a vile place, in which most kinds of debauchery and
villainy were practised, and where dire diseases were bred, that came
52
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
into court with the prisoners, and sometimes rushed straight from the
dock at my Lord Chief Justice himself, and pulled him off the bench.
It had more than once happened, that the Judge in the black cap pronounced his own doom as certainly as the prisoner’s, and even died
before him. For the rest, the Old Bailey was famous as a kind of deadly
inn-yard, from which pale travellers set out continually, in carts and
coaches, on a violent passage into the other world: traversing some two
miles and a half of public street and road, and shaming few good citizens, if any. So powerful is use, and so desirable to be good use in the
beginning. It was famous, too, for the pillory, a wise old institution,
that inflicted a punishment of which no one could foresee the extent;
also, for the whipping-post, another dear old institution, very humanising and softening to behold in action; also, for extensive transactions
in blood-money, another fragment of ancestral wisdom, systematically
leading to the most frightful mercenary crimes that could be committed
under Heaven. Altogether, the Old Bailey, at that date, was a choice
illustration of the precept, that “Whatever is is right;” an aphorism that
would be as final as it is lazy, did it not include the troublesome consequence, that nothing that ever was, was wrong.
Making his way through the tainted crowd, dispersed up and down
this hideous scene of action, with the skill of a man accustomed to
make his way quietly, the messenger found out the door he sought, and
handed in his letter through a trap in it. For, people then paid to see
the play at the Old Bailey, just as they paid to see the play in Bedlam—
only the former entertainment was much the dearer. Therefore, all the
Old Bailey doors were well guarded—except, indeed, the social doors
by which the criminals got there, and those were always left wide open.
After some delay and demur, the door grudgingly turned on its
hinges a very little way, and allowed Mr. Jerry Cruncher to squeeze
himself into court.
“What’s on?” he asked, in a whisper, of the man he found himself
next to.
“Nothing yet.”
“What’s coming on?”
“The Treason case.”
“The quartering one, eh?”
“Ah!” returned the man, with a relish; “he’ll be drawn on a hurdle
to be half hanged, and then he’ll be taken down and sliced before his
own face, and then his inside will be taken out and burnt while he looks
53
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
on, and then his head will be chopped off, and he’ll be cut into quarters.
That’s the sentence.”
“If he’s found Guilty, you mean to say?” Jerry added, by way of
proviso.
“Oh! they’ll find him guilty,” said the other. “Don’t you be afraid
of that.”
Mr. Cruncher’s attention was here diverted to the door-keeper,
whom he saw making his way to Mr. Lorry, with the note in his hand.
Mr. Lorry sat at a table, among the gentlemen in wigs: not far from
a wigged gentleman, the prisoner’s counsel, who had a great bundle of
papers before him: and nearly opposite another wigged gentleman with
his hands in his pockets, whose whole attention, when Mr. Cruncher
looked at him then or afterwards, seemed to be concentrated on the ceiling of the court. After some gruff coughing and rubbing of his chin and
signing with his hand, Jerry attracted the notice of Mr. Lorry, who had
stood up to look for him, and who quietly nodded and sat down again.
“What’s he got to do with the case?” asked the man he had spoken
with.
“Blest if I know,” said Jerry.
“What have you got to do with it, then, if a person may inquire?”
“Blest if I know that either,” said Jerry.
The entrance of the Judge, and a consequent great stir and settling
down in the court, stopped the dialogue. Presently, the dock became
the central point of interest. Two gaolers, who had been standing there,
wont out, and the prisoner was brought in, and put to the bar.
Everybody present, except the one wigged gentleman who looked at
the ceiling, stared at him. All the human breath in the place, rolled at
him, like a sea, or a wind, or a fire. Eager faces strained round pillars
and corners, to get a sight of him; spectators in back rows stood up,
not to miss a hair of him; people on the floor of the court, laid their
hands on the shoulders of the people before them, to help themselves,
at anybody’s cost, to a view of him—stood a-tiptoe, got upon ledges,
stood upon next to nothing, to see every inch of him. Conspicuous
among these latter, like an animated bit of the spiked wall of Newgate,
Jerry stood: aiming at the prisoner the beery breath of a whet he had
taken as he came along, and discharging it to mingle with the waves
of other beer, and gin, and tea, and coffee, and what not, that flowed
at him, and already broke upon the great windows behind him in an
impure mist and rain.
54
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
The object of all this staring and blaring, was a young man of about
five-and-twenty, well-grown and well-looking, with a sunburnt cheek
and a dark eye. His condition was that of a young gentleman. He
was plainly dressed in black, or very dark grey, and his hair, which was
long and dark, was gathered in a ribbon at the back of his neck; more
to be out of his way than for ornament. As an emotion of the mind
will express itself through any covering of the body, so the paleness
which his situation engendered came through the brown upon his cheek,
showing the soul to be stronger than the sun. He was otherwise quite
self-possessed, bowed to the Judge, and stood quiet.
The sort of interest with which this man was stared and breathed
at, was not a sort that elevated humanity. Had he stood in peril of a
less horrible sentence—had there been a chance of any one of its savage
details being spared—by just so much would he have lost in his fascination. The form that was to be doomed to be so shamefully mangled,
was the sight; the immortal creature that was to be so butchered and
torn asunder, yielded the sensation. Whatever gloss the various spectators put upon the interest, according to their several arts and powers of
self-deceit, the interest was, at the root of it, Ogreish.
Silence in the court! Charles Darnay had yesterday pleaded Not
Guilty to an indictment denouncing him (with infinite jingle and jangle)
for that he was a false traitor to our serene, illustrious, excellent, and
so forth, prince, our Lord the King, by reason of his having, on divers
occasions, and by divers means and ways, assisted Lewis, the French
King, in his wars against our said serene, illustrious, excellent, and so
forth; that was to say, by coming and going, between the dominions
of our said serene, illustrious, excellent, and so forth, and those of the
said French Lewis, and wickedly, falsely, traitorously, and otherwise
evil-adverbiously, revealing to the said French Lewis what forces our
said serene, illustrious, excellent, and so forth, had in preparation to
send to Canada and North America. This much, Jerry, with his head
becoming more and more spiky as the law terms bristled it, made out
with huge satisfaction, and so arrived circuitously at the understanding
that the aforesaid, and over and over again aforesaid, Charles Darnay,
stood there before him upon his trial; that the jury were swearing in;
and that Mr. Attorney-General was making ready to speak.
The accused, who was (and who knew he was) being mentally
hanged, beheaded, and quartered, by everybody there, neither flinched
from the situation, nor assumed any theatrical air in it. He was quiet
55
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
and attentive; watched the opening proceedings with a grave interest;
and stood with his hands resting on the slab of wood before him, so
composedly, that they had not displaced a leaf of the herbs with which
it was strewn. The court was all bestrewn with herbs and sprinkled with
vinegar, as a precaution against gaol air and gaol fever.
Over the prisoner’s head there was a mirror, to throw the light down
upon him. Crowds of the wicked and the wretched had been reflected
in it, and had passed from its surface and this earth’s together. Haunted
in a most ghastly manner that abominable place would have been, if
the glass could ever have rendered back its reflections, as the ocean is
one day to give up its dead. Some passing thought of the infamy and
disgrace for which it had been reserved, may have struck the prisoner’s
mind. Be that as it may, a change in his position making him conscious
of a bar of light across his face, he looked up; and when he saw the glass
his face flushed, and his right hand pushed the herbs away.
It happened, that the action turned his face to that side of the court
which was on his left. About on a level with his eyes, there sat, in that
corner of the Judge’s bench, two persons upon whom his look immediately rested; so immediately, and so much to the changing of his aspect,
that all the eyes that were tamed upon him, turned to them.
The spectators saw in the two figures, a young lady of little more
than twenty, and a gentleman who was evidently her father; a man of a
very remarkable appearance in respect of the absolute whiteness of his
hair, and a certain indescribable intensity of face: not of an active kind,
but pondering and self-communing. When this expression was upon
him, he looked as if he were old; but when it was stirred and broken
up—as it was now, in a moment, on his speaking to his daughter—he
became a handsome man, not past the prime of life.
His daughter had one of her hands drawn through his arm, as she
sat by him, and the other pressed upon it. She had drawn close to him,
in her dread of the scene, and in her pity for the prisoner. Her forehead
had been strikingly expressive of an engrossing terror and compassion
that saw nothing but the peril of the accused. This had been so very
noticeable, so very powerfully and naturally shown, that starers who
had had no pity for him were touched by her; and the whisper went
about, “Who are they?”
Jerry, the messenger, who had made his own observations, in his
own manner, and who had been sucking the rust off his fingers in his
absorption, stretched his neck to hear who they were. The crowd about
56
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
him had pressed and passed the inquiry on to the nearest attendant, and
from him it had been more slowly pressed and passed back; at last it got
to Jerry:
“Witnesses.”
“For which side?”
“Against.”
“Against what side?”
“The prisoner’s.”
The Judge, whose eyes had gone in the general direction, recalled
them, leaned back in his seat, and looked steadily at the man whose life
was in his hand, as Mr. Attorney-General rose to spin the rope, grind
the axe, and hammer the nails into the scaffold.
Chapter 3
A Disappointment
Mr. Attorney-General had to inform the jury, that the prisoner before
them, though young in years, was old in the treasonable practices which
claimed the forfeit of his life. That this correspondence with the public
enemy was not a correspondence of to-day, or of yesterday, or even of
last year, or of the year before. That, it was certain the prisoner had,
for longer than that, been in the habit of passing and repassing between
France and England, on secret business of which he could give no honest account. That, if it were in the nature of traitorous ways to thrive
(which happily it never was), the real wickedness and guilt of his business might have remained undiscovered. That Providence, however, had
put it into the heart of a person who was beyond fear and beyond reproach, to ferret out the nature of the prisoner’s schemes, and, struck
with horror, to disclose them to his Majesty’s Chief Secretary of State
and most honourable Privy Council. That, this patriot would be produced before them. That, his position and attitude were, on the whole,
sublime. That, he had been the prisoner’s friend, but, at once in an auspicious and an evil hour detecting his infamy, had resolved to immolate
the traitor he could no longer cherish in his bosom, on the sacred altar
of his country. That, if statues were decreed in Britain, as in ancient
Greece and Rome, to public benefactors, this shining citizen would assuredly have had one. That, as they were not so decreed, he probably
57
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
would not have one. That, Virtue, as had been observed by the poets (in
many passages which he well knew the jury would have, word for word,
at the tips of their tongues; whereat the jury’s countenances displayed
a guilty consciousness that they knew nothing about the passages), was
in a manner contagious; more especially the bright virtue known as patriotism, or love of country. That, the lofty example of this immaculate
and unimpeachable witness for the Crown, to refer to whom however
unworthily was an honour, had communicated itself to the prisoner’s servant, and had engendered in him a holy determination to examine his
master’s table-drawers and pockets, and secrete his papers. That, he (Mr.
Attorney-General) was prepared to hear some disparagement attempted
of this admirable servant; but that, in a general way, he preferred him
to his (Mr. Attorney-General’s) brothers and sisters, and honoured him
more than his (Mr. Attorney-General’s) father and mother. That, he
called with confidence on the jury to come and do likewise. That, the
evidence of these two witnesses, coupled with the documents of their
discovering that would be produced, would show the prisoner to have
been furnished with lists of his Majesty’s forces, and of their disposition and preparation, both by sea and land, and would leave no doubt
that he had habitually conveyed such information to a hostile power.
That, these lists could not be proved to be in the prisoner’s handwriting;
but that it was all the same; that, indeed, it was rather the better for
the prosecution, as showing the prisoner to be artful in his precautions.
That, the proof would go back five years, and would show the prisoner
already engaged in these pernicious missions, within a few weeks before
the date of the very first action fought between the British troops and
the Americans. That, for these reasons, the jury, being a loyal jury (as
he knew they were), and being a responsible jury (as they knew they
were), must positively find the prisoner Guilty, and make an end of him,
whether they liked it or not. That, they never could lay their heads upon
their pillows; that, they never could tolerate the idea of their wives laying their heads upon their pillows; that, they never could endure the
notion of their children laying their heads upon their pillows; in short,
that there never more could be, for them or theirs, any laying of heads
upon pillows at all, unless the prisoner’s head was taken off. That head
Mr. Attorney-General concluded by demanding of them, in the name of
everything he could think of with a round turn in it, and on the faith of
his solemn asseveration that he already considered the prisoner as good
as dead and gone.
58
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
When the Attorney-General ceased, a buzz arose in the court as if
a cloud of great blue-flies were swarming about the prisoner, in anticipation of what he was soon to become. When toned down again, the
unimpeachable patriot appeared in the witness-box.
Mr. Solicitor-General then, following his leader’s lead, examined the
patriot: John Barsad, gentleman, by name. The story of his pure soul
was exactly what Mr. Attorney-General had described it to be—perhaps,
if it had a fault, a little too exactly. Having released his noble bosom
of its burden, he would have modestly withdrawn himself, but that the
wigged gentleman with the papers before him, sitting not far from Mr.
Lorry, begged to ask him a few questions. The wigged gentleman sitting
opposite, still looking at the ceiling of the court.
Had he ever been a spy himself? No, he scorned the base insinuation. What did he live upon? His property. Where was his property?
He didn’t precisely remember where it was. What was it? No business
of anybody’s. Had he inherited it? Yes, he had. From whom? Distant relation. Very distant? Rather. Ever been in prison? Certainly
not. Never in a debtors’ prison? Didn’t see what that had to do with
it. Never in a debtors’ prison?—Come, once again. Never? Yes. How
many times? Two or three times. Not five or six? Perhaps. Of what profession? Gentleman. Ever been kicked? Might have been. Frequently?
No. Ever kicked downstairs? Decidedly not; once received a kick on
the top of a staircase, and fell downstairs of his own accord. Kicked
on that occasion for cheating at dice? Something to that effect was said
by the intoxicated liar who committed the assault, but it was not true.
Swear it was not true? Positively. Ever live by cheating at play? Never.
Ever live by play? Not more than other gentlemen do. Ever borrow
money of the prisoner? Yes. Ever pay him? No. Was not this intimacy
with the prisoner, in reality a very slight one, forced upon the prisoner
in coaches, inns, and packets? No. Sure he saw the prisoner with these
lists? Certain. Knew no more about the lists? No. Had not procured
them himself, for instance? No. Expect to get anything by this evidence?
No. Not in regular government pay and employment, to lay traps? Oh
dear no. Or to do anything? Oh dear no. Swear that? Over and over
again. No motives but motives of sheer patriotism? None whatever.
The virtuous servant, Roger Cly, swore his way through the case at
a great rate. He had taken service with the prisoner, in good faith and
simplicity, four years ago. He had asked the prisoner, aboard the Calais
packet, if he wanted a handy fellow, and the prisoner had engaged him.
59
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
He had not asked the prisoner to take the handy fellow as an act of
charity—never thought of such a thing. He began to have suspicions
of the prisoner, and to keep an eye upon him, soon afterwards. In arranging his clothes, while travelling, he had seen similar lists to these
in the prisoner’s pockets, over and over again. He had taken these lists
from the drawer of the prisoner’s desk. He had not put them there
first. He had seen the prisoner show these identical lists to French gentlemen at Calais, and similar lists to French gentlemen, both at Calais
and Boulogne. He loved his country, and couldn’t bear it, and had given
information. He had never been suspected of stealing a silver tea-pot;
he had been maligned respecting a mustard-pot, but it turned out to be
only a plated one. He had known the last witness seven or eight years;
that was merely a coincidence. He didn’t call it a particularly curious
coincidence; most coincidences were curious. Neither did he call it a
curious coincidence that true patriotism was his only motive too. He
was a true Briton, and hoped there were many like him.
The blue-flies buzzed again, and Mr. Attorney-General called Mr.
Jarvis Lorry.
“Mr. Jarvis Lorry, are you a clerk in Tellson’s bank?”
“I am.”
“On a certain Friday night in November one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five, did business occasion you to travel between London and Dover by the mail?”
“It did.”
“Were there any other passengers in the mail?”
“Two.”
“Did they alight on the road in the course of the night?”
“They did.”
“Mr. Lorry, look upon the prisoner. Was he one of those two passengers?”
“I cannot undertake to say that he was.”
“Does he resemble either of these two passengers?”
“Both were so wrapped up, and the night was so dark, and we were
all so reserved, that I cannot undertake to say even that.”
“Mr. Lorry, look again upon the prisoner. Supposing him wrapped
up as those two passengers were, is there anything in his bulk and
stature to render it unlikely that he was one of them?”
“No.”
“You will not swear, Mr. Lorry, that he was not one of them?”
60
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
“No.”
“So at least you say he may have been one of them?”
“Yes. Except that I remember them both to have been—like myself—
timorous of highwaymen, and the prisoner has not a timorous air.”
“Did you ever see a counterfeit of timidity, Mr. Lorry?”
“I certainly have seen that.”
“Mr. Lorry, look once more upon the prisoner. Have you seen him,
to your certain knowledge, before?”
“I have.”
“When?”
“I was returning from France a few days afterwards, and, at Calais,
the prisoner came on board the packet-ship in which I returned, and
made the voyage with me.”
“At what hour did he come on board?”
“At a little after midnight.”
“In the dead of the night. Was he the only passenger who came on
board at that untimely hour?”
“He happened to be the only one.”
“Never mind about ‘happening,’ Mr. Lorry. He was the only passenger who came on board in the dead of the night?”
“He was.”
“Were you travelling alone, Mr. Lorry, or with any companion?”
“With two companions. A gentleman and lady. They are here.”
“They are here. Had you any conversation with the prisoner?”
“Hardly any. The weather was stormy, and the passage long and
rough, and I lay on a sofa, almost from shore to shore.”
“Miss Manette!”
The young lady, to whom all eyes had been turned before, and were
now turned again, stood up where she had sat. Her father rose with her,
and kept her hand drawn through his arm.
“Miss Manette, look upon the prisoner.”
To be confronted with such pity, and such earnest youth and beauty,
was far more trying to the accused than to be confronted with all the
crowd. Standing, as it were, apart with her on the edge of his grave, not
all the staring curiosity that looked on, could, for the moment, nerve
him to remain quite still. His hurried right hand parcelled out the herbs
before him into imaginary beds of flowers in a garden; and his efforts to
control and steady his breathing shook the lips from which the colour
rushed to his heart. The buzz of the great flies was loud again.
61
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
“Miss Manette, have you seen the prisoner before?”
“Yes, sir.”
“Where?”
“On board of the packet-ship just now referred to, sir, and on the
same occasion.”
“You are the young lady just now referred to?”
“O! most unhappily, I am!”
The plaintive tone of her compassion merged into the less musical
voice of the Judge, as he said something fiercely: “Answer the questions
put to you, and make no remark upon them.”
“Miss Manette, had you any conversation with the prisoner on that
passage across the Channel?”
“Yes, sir.”
“Recall it.”
In the midst of a profound stillness, she faintly began: “When the
gentleman came on board—”
“Do you mean the prisoner?” inquired the Judge, knitting his brows.
“Yes, my Lord.”
“Then say the prisoner.”
“When the prisoner came on board, he noticed that my father,” turning her eyes lovingly to him as he stood beside her, “was much fatigued
and in a very weak state of health. My father was so reduced that I was
afraid to take him out of the air, and I had made a bed for him on the
deck near the cabin steps, and I sat on the deck at his side to take care of
him. There were no other passengers that night, but we four. The prisoner was so good as to beg permission to advise me how I could shelter
my father from the wind and weather, better than I had done. I had not
known how to do it well, not understanding how the wind would set
when we were out of the harbour. He did it for me. He expressed great
gentleness and kindness for my father’s state, and I am sure he felt it.
That was the manner of our beginning to speak together.”
“Let me interrupt you for a moment. Had he come on board alone?”
“No.”
“How many were with him?”
“Two French gentlemen.”
“Had they conferred together?”
“They had conferred together until the last moment, when it was
necessary for the French gentlemen to be landed in their boat.”
“Had any papers been handed about among them, similar to these
62
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
lists?”
“Some papers had been handed about among them, but I don’t know
what papers.”
“Like these in shape and size?”
“Possibly, but indeed I don’t know, although they stood whispering
very near to me: because they stood at the top of the cabin steps to have
the light of the lamp that was hanging there; it was a dull lamp, and
they spoke very low, and I did not hear what they said, and saw only
that they looked at papers.”
“Now, to the prisoner’s conversation, Miss Manette.”
“The prisoner was as open in his confidence with me—which arose
out of my helpless situation—as he was kind, and good, and useful to
my father. I hope,” bursting into tears, “I may not repay him by doing
him harm to-day.”
Buzzing from the blue-flies.
“Miss Manette, if the prisoner does not perfectly understand that
you give the evidence which it is your duty to give—which you must
give—and which you cannot escape from giving—with great unwillingness, he is the only person present in that condition. Please to go on.”
“He told me that he was travelling on business of a delicate and
difficult nature, which might get people into trouble, and that he was
therefore travelling under an assumed name. He said that this business
had, within a few days, taken him to France, and might, at intervals,
take him backwards and forwards between France and England for a
long time to come.”
“Did he say anything about America, Miss Manette? Be particular.”
“He tried to explain to me how that quarrel had arisen, and he
said that, so far as he could judge, it was a wrong and foolish one
on England’s part. He added, in a jesting way, that perhaps George
Washington might gain almost as great a name in history as George the
Third. But there was no harm in his way of saying this: it was said
laughingly, and to beguile the time.”
Any strongly marked expression of face on the part of a chief actor
in a scene of great interest to whom many eyes are directed, will be
unconsciously imitated by the spectators. Her forehead was painfully
anxious and intent as she gave this evidence, and, in the pauses when
she stopped for the Judge to write it down, watched its effect upon
the counsel for and against. Among the lookers-on there was the same
expression in all quarters of the court; insomuch, that a great majority
63
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
of the foreheads there, might have been mirrors reflecting the witness,
when the Judge looked up from his notes to glare at that tremendous
heresy about George Washington.
Mr. Attorney-General now signified to my Lord, that he deemed it
necessary, as a matter of precaution and form, to call the young lady’s
father, Doctor Manette. Who was called accordingly.
“Doctor Manette, look upon the prisoner. Have you ever seen him
before?”
“Once. When he caged at my lodgings in London. Some three years,
or three years and a half ago.”
“Can you identify him as your fellow-passenger on board the packet,
or speak to his conversation with your daughter?”
“Sir, I can do neither.”
“Is there any particular and special reason for your being unable to
do either?”
He answered, in a low voice, “There is.”
“Has it been your misfortune to undergo a long imprisonment, without trial, or even accusation, in your native country, Doctor Manette?”
He answered, in a tone that went to every heart, “A long imprisonment.”
“Were you newly released on the occasion in question?”
“They tell me so.”
“Have you no remembrance of the occasion?”
“None. My mind is a blank, from some time—I cannot even say
what time—when I employed myself, in my captivity, in making shoes,
to the time when I found myself living in London with my dear daughter
here. She had become familiar to me, when a gracious God restored
my faculties; but, I am quite unable even to say how she had become
familiar. I have no remembrance of the process.”
Mr. Attorney-General sat down, and the father and daughter sat
down together.
A singular circumstance then arose in the case. The object in hand
being to show that the prisoner went down, with some fellow-plotter untracked, in the Dover mail on that Friday night in November five years
ago, and got out of the mail in the night, as a blind, at a place where
he did not remain, but from which he travelled back some dozen miles
or more, to a garrison and dockyard, and there collected information;
a witness was called to identify him as having been at the precise time
required, in the coffee-room of an hotel in that garrison-and-dockyard
64
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
town, waiting for another person. The prisoner’s counsel was crossexamining this witness with no result, except that he had never seen the
prisoner on any other occasion, when the wigged gentleman who had
all this time been looking at the ceiling of the court, wrote a word or
two on a little piece of paper, screwed it up, and tossed it to him. Opening this piece of paper in the next pause, the counsel looked with great
attention and curiosity at the prisoner.
“You say again you are quite sure that it was the prisoner?”
The witness was quite sure.
“Did you ever see anybody very like the prisoner?”
Not so like (the witness said) as that he could be mistaken.
“Look well upon that gentleman, my learned friend there,” pointing
to him who had tossed the paper over, “and then look well upon the
prisoner. How say you? Are they very like each other?”
Allowing for my learned friend’s appearance being careless and
slovenly if not debauched, they were sufficiently like each other to surprise, not only the witness, but everybody present, when they were thus
brought into comparison. My Lord being prayed to bid my learned
friend lay aside his wig, and giving no very gracious consent, the likeness became much more remarkable. My Lord inquired of Mr. Stryver
(the prisoner’s counsel), whether they were next to try Mr. Carton (name
of my learned friend) for treason? But, Mr. Stryver replied to my Lord,
no; but he would ask the witness to tell him whether what happened
once, might happen twice; whether he would have been so confident if
he had seen this illustration of his rashness sooner, whether he would
be so confident, having seen it; and more. The upshot of which, was, to
smash this witness like a crockery vessel, and shiver his part of the case
to useless lumber.
Mr. Cruncher had by this time taken quite a lunch of rust off his
fingers in his following of the evidence. He had now to attend while
Mr. Stryver fitted the prisoner’s case on the jury, like a compact suit
of clothes; showing them how the patriot, Barsad, was a hired spy
and traitor, an unblushing trafficker in blood, and one of the greatest
scoundrels upon earth since accursed Judas—which he certainly did
look rather like. How the virtuous servant, Cly, was his friend and
partner, and was worthy to be; how the watchful eyes of those forgers
and false swearers had rested on the prisoner as a victim, because some
family affairs in France, he being of French extraction, did require his
making those passages across the Channel—though what those affairs
65
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
were, a consideration for others who were near and dear to him, forbade him, even for his life, to disclose. How the evidence that had been
warped and wrested from the young lady, whose anguish in giving it
they had witnessed, came to nothing, involving the mere little innocent
gallantries and politenesses likely to pass between any young gentleman
and young lady so thrown together;—with the exception of that reference to George Washington, which was altogether too extravagant and
impossible to be regarded in any other light than as a monstrous joke.
How it would be a weakness in the government to break down in this
attempt to practise for popularity on the lowest national antipathies and
fears, and therefore Mr. Attorney-General had made the most of it; how,
nevertheless, it rested upon nothing, save that vile and infamous character of evidence too often disfiguring such cases, and of which the State
Trials of this country were full. But, there my Lord interposed (with as
grave a face as if it had not been true), saying that he could not sit upon
that Bench and suffer those allusions.
Mr. Stryver then called his few witnesses, and Mr. Cruncher had next
to attend while Mr. Attorney-General turned the whole suit of clothes
Mr. Stryver had fitted on the jury, inside out; showing how Barsad and
Cly were even a hundred times better than he had thought them, and the
prisoner a hundred times worse. Lastly, came my Lord himself, turning
the suit of clothes, now inside out, now outside in, but on the whole decidedly trimming and shaping them into grave-clothes for the prisoner.
And now, the jury turned to consider, and the great flies swarmed
again.
Mr. Carton, who had so long sat looking at the ceiling of the court,
changed neither his place nor his attitude, even in this excitement. While
his teamed friend, Mr. Stryver, massing his papers before him, whispered with those who sat near, and from time to time glanced anxiously
at the jury; while all the spectators moved more or less, and grouped
themselves anew; while even my Lord himself arose from his seat, and
slowly paced up and down his platform, not unattended by a suspicion
in the minds of the audience that his state was feverish; this one man sat
leaning back, with his torn gown half off him, his untidy wig put on just
as it had happened to fight on his head after its removal, his hands in his
pockets, and his eyes on the ceiling as they had been all day. Something
especially reckless in his demeanour, not only gave him a disreputable
look, but so diminished the strong resemblance he undoubtedly bore to
the prisoner (which his momentary earnestness, when they were com66
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
pared together, had strengthened), that many of the lookers-on, taking
note of him now, said to one another they would hardly have thought
the two were so alike. Mr. Cruncher made the observation to his next
neighbour, and added, “I’d hold half a guinea that he don’t get no lawwork to do. Don’t look like the sort of one to get any, do he?”
Yet, this Mr. Carton took in more of the details of the scene than he
appeared to take in; for now, when Miss Manette’s head dropped upon
her father’s breast, he was the first to see it, and to say audibly: “Officer!
look to that young lady. Help the gentleman to take her out. Don’t you
see she will fall!”
There was much commiseration for her as she was removed, and
much sympathy with her father. It had evidently been a great distress
to him, to have the days of his imprisonment recalled. He had shown
strong internal agitation when he was questioned, and that pondering
or brooding look which made him old, had been upon him, like a heavy
cloud, ever since. As he passed out, the jury, who had turned back and
paused a moment, spoke, through their foreman.
They were not agreed, and wished to retire. My Lord (perhaps with
George Washington on his mind) showed some surprise that they were
not agreed, but signified his pleasure that they should retire under watch
and ward, and retired himself. The trial had lasted all day, and the
lamps in the court were now being lighted. It began to be rumoured
that the jury would be out a long while. The spectators dropped off to
get refreshment, and the prisoner withdrew to the back of the dock, and
sat down.
Mr. Lorry, who had gone out when the young lady and her father
went out, now reappeared, and beckoned to Jerry: who, in the slackened interest, could easily get near him.
“Jerry, if you wish to take something to eat, you can. But, keep in
the way. You will be sure to hear when the jury come in. Don’t be a
moment behind them, for I want you to take the verdict back to the
bank. You are the quickest messenger I know, and will get to Temple
Bar long before I can.”
Jerry had just enough forehead to knuckle, and he knuckled it in
acknowedgment of this communication and a shilling. Mr. Carton came
up at the moment, and touched Mr. Lorry on the arm.
“How is the young lady?”
“She is greatly distressed; but her father is comforting her, and she
feels the better for being out of court.”
67
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
“I’ll tell the prisoner so. It won’t do for a respectable bank gentleman like you, to be seen speaking to him publicly, you know.”
Mr. Lorry reddened as if he were conscious of having debated the
point in his mind, and Mr. Carton made his way to the outside of the
bar. The way out of court lay in that direction, and Jerry followed him,
all eyes, ears, and spikes.
“Mr. Darnay!”
The prisoner came forward directly.
“You will naturally be anxious to hear of the witness, Miss Manette.
She will do very well. You have seen the worst of her agitation.”
“I am deeply sorry to have been the cause of it. Could you tell her
so for me, with my fervent acknowledgments?”
“Yes, I could. I will, if you ask it.”
Mr. Carton’s manner was so careless as to be almost insolent. He
stood, half turned from the prisoner, lounging with his elbow against
the bar.
“I do ask it. Accept my cordial thanks.”
“What,” said Carton, still only half turned towards him, “do you
expect, Mr. Darnay?”
“The worst.”
“It’s the wisest thing to expect, and the likeliest. But I think their
withdrawing is in your favour.”
Loitering on the way out of court not being allowed, Jerry heard no
more: but left them—so like each other in feature, so unlike each other
in manner—standing side by side, both reflected in the glass above them.
An hour and a half limped heavily away in the thief-and-rascal
crowded passages below, even though assisted off with mutton pies and
ale. The hoarse messenger, uncomfortably seated on a form after taking
that refection, had dropped into a doze, when a loud murmur and a
rapid tide of people setting up the stairs that led to the court, carried
him along with them.
“Jerry! Jerry!” Mr. Lorry was already calling at the door when he
got there.
“Here, sir! It’s a fight to get back again. Here I am, sir!”
Mr. Lorry handed him a paper through the throng. “Quick! Have
you got it?”
“Yes, sir.”
Hastily written on the paper was the word “aquitted.”
“If you had sent the message, ‘Recalled to Life,’ again,” muttered
68
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
Jerry, as he turned, “I should have known what you meant, this time.”
He had no opportunity of saying, or so much as thinking, anything
else, until he was clear of the Old Bailey; for, the crowd came pouring
out with a vehemence that nearly took him off his legs, and a loud buzz
swept into the street as if the baffled blue-flies were dispersing in search
of other carrion.
Chapter 4
Congratulatory
From the dimly-lighted passages of the court, the last sediment of the
human stew that had been boiling there all day, was straining off, when
Doctor Manette, Lucie Manette, his daughter, Mr. Lorry, the solicitor
for the defence, and its counsel, Mr. Stryver, stood gathered round Mr.
Charles Darnay—just released—congratulating him on his escape from
death.
It would have been difficult by a far brighter light, to recognise in
Doctor Manette, intellectual of face and upright of bearing, the shoemaker of the garret in Paris. Yet, no one could have looked at him twice,
without looking again: even though the opportunity of observation had
not extended to the mournful cadence of his low grave voice, and to
the abstraction that overclouded him fitfully, without any apparent reason. While one external cause, and that a reference to his long lingering
agony, would always—as on the trial—evoke this condition from the
depths of his soul, it was also in its nature to arise of itself, and to draw
a gloom over him, as incomprehensible to those unacquainted with his
story as if they had seen the shadow of the actual Bastille thrown upon
him by a summer sun, when the substance was three hundred miles
away.
Only his daughter had the power of charming this black brooding
from his mind. She was the golden thread that united him to a Past
beyond his misery, and to a Present beyond his misery: and the sound
of her voice, the light of her face, the touch of her hand, had a strong
beneficial influence with him almost always. Not absolutely always, for
she could recall some occasions on which her power had failed; but they
were few and slight, and she believed them over.
69
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
Mr. Darnay had kissed her hand fervently and gratefully, and had
turned to Mr. Stryver, whom he warmly thanked. Mr. Stryver, a man of
little more than thirty, but looking twenty years older than he was, stout,
loud, red, bluff, and free from any drawback of delicacy, had a pushing
way of shouldering himself (morally and physically) into companies and
conversations, that argued well for his shouldering his way up in life.
He still had his wig and gown on, and he said, squaring himself at
his late client to that degree that he squeezed the innocent Mr. Lorry
clean out of the group: “I am glad to have brought you off with honour,
Mr. Darnay. It was an infamous prosecution, grossly infamous; but not
the less likely to succeed on that account.”
“You have laid me under an obligation to you for life—in two
senses,” said his late client, taking his hand.
“I have done my best for you, Mr. Darnay; and my best is as good
as another man’s, I believe.”
It clearly being incumbent on some one to say, “Much better,” Mr.
Lorry said it; perhaps not quite disinterestedly, but with the interested
object of squeezing himself back again.
“You think so?” said Mr. Stryver. “Well! you have been present all
day, and you ought to know. You are a man of business, too.”
“And as such,” quoth Mr. Lorry, whom the counsel learned in the
law had now shouldered back into the group, just as he had previously
shouldered him out of it—“as such I will appeal to Doctor Manette, to
break up this conference and order us all to our homes. Miss Lucie
looks ill, Mr. Darnay has had a terrible day, we are worn out.”
“Speak for yourself, Mr. Lorry,” said Stryver; “I have a night’s work
to do yet. Speak for yourself.”
“I speak for myself,” answered Mr. Lorry, “and for Mr. Darnay, and
for Miss Lucie, and—Miss Lucie, do you not think I may speak for us
all?” He asked her the question pointedly, and with a glance at her
father.
His face had become frozen, as it were, in a very curious look at
Darnay: an intent look, deepening into a frown of dislike and distrust,
not even unmixed with fear. With this strange expression on him his
thoughts had wandered away.
“My father,” said Lucie, softly laying her hand on his.
He slowly shook the shadow off, and turned to her.
“Shall we go home, my father?”
With a long breath, he answered “Yes.”
70
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
The friends of the acquitted prisoner had dispersed, under the
impression—which he himself had originated—that he would not be
released that night. The lights were nearly all extinguished in the passages, the iron gates were being closed with a jar and a rattle, and the
dismal place was deserted until to-morrow morning’s interest of gallows,
pillory, whipping-post, and branding-iron, should repeople it. Walking
between her father and Mr. Darnay, Lucie Manette passed into the open
air. A hackney-coach was called, and the father and daughter departed
in it.
Mr. Stryver had left them in the passages, to shoulder his way back
to the robing-room. Another person, who had not joined the group,
or interchanged a word with any one of them, but who had been leaning against the wall where its shadow was darkest, had silently strolled
out after the rest, and had looked on until the coach drove away. He
now stepped up to where Mr. Lorry and Mr. Darnay stood upon the
pavement.
“So, Mr. Lorry! Men of business may speak to Mr. Darnay now?”
Nobody had made any acknowledgment of Mr. Carton’s part in the
day’s proceedings; nobody had known of it. He was unrobed, and was
none the better for it in appearance.
“If you knew what a conflict goes on in the business mind, when the
business mind is divided between good-natured impulse and business
appearances, you would be amused, Mr. Darnay.”
Mr. Lorry reddened, and said, warmly, “You have mentioned that
before, sir. We men of business, who serve a House, are not our own
masters. We have to think of the House more than ourselves.”
“I know, I know,” rejoined Mr. Carton, carelessly. “Don’t be nettled,
Mr. Lorry. You are as good as another, I have no doubt: better, I dare
say.”
“And indeed, sir,” pursued Mr. Lorry, not minding him, “I really
don’t know what you have to do with the matter. If you’ll excuse me, as
very much your elder, for saying so, I really don’t know that it is your
business.”
“Business! Bless you, I have no business,” said Mr. Carton.
“It is a pity you have not, sir.”
“I think so, too.”
“If you had,” pursued Mr. Lorry, “perhaps you would attend to it.”
“Lord love you, no!—I shouldn’t,” said Mr. Carton.
“Well, sir!” cried Mr. Lorry, thoroughly heated by his indifference,
71
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
“business is a very good thing, and a very respectable thing. And, sir,
if business imposes its restraints and its silences and impediments, Mr.
Darnay as a young gentleman of generosity knows how to make allowance for that circumstance. Mr. Darnay, good night, God bless you,
sir! I hope you have been this day preserved for a prosperous and happy
life.—Chair there!”
Perhaps a little angry with himself, as well as with the barrister, Mr.
Lorry bustled into the chair, and was carried off to Tellson’s. Carton,
who smelt of port wine, and did not appear to be quite sober, laughed
then, and turned to Darnay:
“This is a strange chance that throws you and me together. This
must be a strange night to you, standing alone here with your counterpart on these street stones?”
“I hardly seem yet,” returned Charles Darnay, “to belong to this
world again.”
“I don’t wonder at it; it’s not so long since you were pretty far advanced on your way to another. You speak faintly.”
“I begin to think I am faint.”
“Then why the devil don’t you dine? I dined, myself, while those
numskulls were deliberating which world you should belong to—this,
or some other. Let me show you the nearest tavern to dine well at.”
Drawing his arm through his own, he took him down Ludgate-hill
to Fleet-street, and so, up a covered way, into a tavern. Here, they were
shown into a little room, where Charles Darnay was soon recruiting
his strength with a good plain dinner and good wine: while Carton sat
opposite to him at the same table, with his separate bottle of port before
him, and his fully half-insolent manner upon him.
“Do you feel, yet, that you belong to this terrestrial scheme again,
Mr. Darnay?”
“I am frightfully confused regarding time and place; but I am so far
mended as to feel that.”
“It must be an immense satisfaction!”
He said it bitterly, and filled up his glass again: which was a large
one.
“As to me, the greatest desire I have, is to forget that I belong to it.
It has no good in it for me—except wine like this—nor I for it. So we
are not much alike in that particular. Indeed, I begin to think we are not
much alike in any particular, you and I.”
Confused by the emotion of the day, and feeling his being there with
72
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
this Double of coarse deportment, to be like a dream, Charles Darnay
was at a loss how to answer; finally, answered not at all.
“Now your dinner is done,” Carton presently said, “why don’t you
call a health, Mr. Darnay; why don’t you give your toast?”
“What health? What toast?”
“Why, it’s on the tip of your tongue. It ought to be, it must be, I’ll
swear it’s there.”
“Miss Manette, then!”
“Miss Manette, then!”
Looking his companion full in the face while he drank the toast, Carton flung his glass over his shoulder against the wall, where it shivered
to pieces; then, rang the bell, and ordered in another.
“That’s a fair young lady to hand to a coach in the dark, Mr. Darnay!” he said, ruing his new goblet.
A slight frown and a laconic “Yes,” were the answer.
“That’s a fair young lady to be pitied by and wept for by! How does
it feel? Is it worth being tried for one’s life, to be the object of such
sympathy and compassion, Mr. Darnay?”
Again Darnay answered not a word.
“She was mightily pleased to have your message, when I gave it her.
Not that she showed she was pleased, but I suppose she was.”
The allusion served as a timely reminder to Darnay that this disagreeable companion had, of his own free will, assisted him in the strait of
the day. He turned the dialogue to that point, and thanked him for it.
“I neither want any thanks, nor merit any,” was the careless rejoinder. “It was nothing to do, in the first place; and I don’t know why I did
it, in the second. Mr. Darnay, let me ask you a question.”
“Willingly, and a small return for your good offices.”
“Do you think I particularly like you?”
“Really, Mr. Carton,” returned the other, oddly disconcerted, “I
have not asked myself the question.”
“But ask yourself the question now.”
“You have acted as if you do; but I don’t think you do.”
“I don’t think I do,” said Carton. “I begin to have a very good
opinion of your understanding.”
“Nevertheless,” pursued Darnay, rising to ring the bell, “there is
nothing in that, I hope, to prevent my calling the reckoning, and our
parting without ill-blood on either side.”
Carton rejoining, “Nothing in life!” Darnay rang. “Do you call the
73
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
whole reckoning?” said Carton. On his answering in the affirmative,
“Then bring me another pint of this same wine, drawer, and come and
wake me at ten.”
The bill being paid, Charles Darnay rose and wished him good night.
Without returning the wish, Carton rose too, with something of a threat
of defiance in his manner, and said, “A last word, Mr. Darnay: you think
I am drunk?”
“I think you have been drinking, Mr. Carton.”
“Think? You know I have been drinking.”
“Since I must say so, I know it.”
“Then you shall likewise know why. I am a disappointed drudge, sir.
I care for no man on earth, and no man on earth cares for me.”
“Much to be regretted. You might have used your talents better.”
“May be so, Mr. Darnay; may be not. Don’t let your sober face elate
you, however; you don’t know what it may come to. Good night!”
When he was left alone, this strange being took up a candle, went to
a glass that hung against the wall, and surveyed himself minutely in it.
“Do you particularly like the man?” he muttered, at his own image;
“why should you particularly like a man who resembles you? There is
nothing in you to like; you know that. Ah, confound you! What a
change you have made in yourself! A good reason for taking to a man,
that he shows you what you have fallen away from, and what you might
have been! Change places with him, and would you have been looked
at by those blue eyes as he was, and commiserated by that agitated face
as he was? Come on, and have it out in plain words! You hate the
fellow.”
He resorted to his pint of wine for consolation, drank it all in a few
minutes, and fell asleep on his arms, with his hair straggling over the
table, and a long winding-sheet in the candle dripping down upon him.
Chapter 5
The Jackal
Those were drinking days, and most men drank hard. So very great is
the improvement Time has brought about in such habits, that a moderate statement of the quantity of wine and punch which one man would
swallow in the course of a night, without any detriment to his reputation
74
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
as a perfect gentleman, would seem, in these days, a ridiculous exaggeration. The learned profession of the law was certainly not behind any
other learned profession in its Bacchanalian propensities; neither was
Mr. Stryver, already fast shouldering his way to a large and lucrative
practice, behind his compeers in this particular, any more than in the
drier parts of the legal race.
A favourite at the Old Bailey, and eke at the Sessions, Mr. Stryver
had begun cautiously to hew away the lower staves of the ladder on
which he mounted. Sessions and Old Bailey had now to summon their
favourite, specially, to their longing arms; and shouldering itself towards the visage of the Lord Chief Justice in the Court of King’s Bench,
the florid countenance of Mr. Stryver might be daily seen, bursting out
of the bed of wigs, like a great sunflower pushing its way at the sun
from among a rank garden-full of flaring companions.
It had once been noted at the Bar, that while Mr. Stryver was a glib
man, and an unscrupulous, and a ready, and a bold, he had not that faculty of extracting the essence from a heap of statements, which is among
the most striking and necessary of the advocate’s accomplishments. But,
a remarkable improvement came upon him as to this. The more business he got, the greater his power seemed to grow of getting at its pith
and marrow; and however late at night he sat carousing with Sydney
Carton, he always had his points at his fingers’ ends in the morning.
Sydney Carton, idlest and most unpromising of men, was Stryver’s
great ally. What the two drank together, between Hilary Term and
Michaelmas, might have floated a king’s ship. Stryver never had a case
in hand, anywhere, but Carton was there, with his hands in his pockets,
staring at the ceiling of the court; they went the same Circuit, and even
there they prolonged their usual orgies late into the night, and Carton
was rumoured to be seen at broad day, going home stealthily and unsteadily to his lodgings, like a dissipated cat. At last, it began to get
about, among such as were interested in the matter, that although Sydney Carton would never be a lion, he was an amazingly good jackal,
and that he rendered suit and service to Stryver in that humble capacity.
“Ten o’clock, sir,” said the man at the tavern, whom he had charged
to wake him—“ten o’clock, sir.”
“What’s the matter?”
“Ten o’clock, sir.”
“What do you mean? Ten o’clock at night?”
“Yes, sir. Your honour told me to call you.”
75
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
“Oh! I remember. Very well, very well.”
After a few dull efforts to get to sleep again, which the man dexterously combated by stirring the fire continuously for five minutes, he
got up, tossed his hat on, and walked out. He turned into the Temple,
and, having revived himself by twice pacing the pavements of King’s
Bench-walk and Paper-buildings, turned into the Stryver chambers.
The Stryver clerk, who never assisted at these conferences, had gone
home, and the Stryver principal opened the door. He had his slippers
on, and a loose bed-gown, and his throat was bare for his greater ease.
He had that rather wild, strained, seared marking about the eyes, which
may be observed in all free livers of his class, from the portrait of Jeffries
downward, and which can be traced, under various disguises of Art,
through the portraits of every Drinking Age.
“You are a little late, Memory,” said Stryver.
“About the usual time; it may be a quarter of an hour later.”
They went into a dingy room lined with books and littered with
papers, where there was a blazing fire. A kettle steamed upon the hob,
and in the midst of the wreck of papers a table shone, with plenty of
wine upon it, and brandy, and rum, and sugar, and lemons.
“You have had your bottle, I perceive, Sydney.”
“Two to-night, I think. I have been dining with the day’s client; or
seeing him dine—it’s all one!”
“That was a rare point, Sydney, that you brought to bear upon the
identification. How did you come by it? When did it strike you?”
“I thought he was rather a handsome fellow, and I thought I should
have been much the same sort of fellow, if I had had any luck.”
Mr. Stryver laughed till he shook his precocious paunch.
“You and your luck, Sydney! Get to work, get to work.”
Sullenly enough, the jackal loosened his dress, went into an adjoining room, and came back with a large jug of cold water, a basin, and a
towel or two. Steeping the towels in the water, and partially wringing
them out, he folded them on his head in a manner hideous to behold,
sat down at the table, and said, “Now I am ready!”
“Not much boiling down to be done to-night, Memory,” said Mr.
Stryver, gaily, as he looked among his papers.
“How much?”
“Only two sets of them.”
“Give me the worst first.”
“There they are, Sydney. Fire away!”
76
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
The lion then composed himself on his back on a sofa on one side of
the drinking-table, while the jackal sat at his own paper-bestrewn table
proper, on the other side of it, with the bottles and glasses ready to his
hand. Both resorted to the drinking-table without stint, but each in a
different way; the lion for the most part reclining with his hands in his
waistband, looking at the fire, or occasionally flirting with some lighter
document; the jackal, with knitted brows and intent face, so deep in
his task, that his eyes did not even follow the hand he stretched out
for his glass—which often groped about, for a minute or more, before
it found the glass for his lips. Two or three times, the matter in hand
became so knotty, that the jackal found it imperative on him to get up,
and steep his towels anew. From these pilgrimages to the jug and basin,
he returned with such eccentricities of damp headgear as no words can
describe; which were made the more ludicrous by his anxious gravity.
At length the jackal had got together a compact repast for the lion,
and proceeded to offer it to him. The lion took it with care and caution,
made his selections from it, and his remarks upon it, and the jackal
assisted both. When the repast was fully discussed, the lion put his
hands in his waistband again, and lay down to mediate. The jackal then
invigorated himself with a bum for his throttle, and a fresh application
to his head, and applied himself to the collection of a second meal; this
was administered to the lion in the same manner, and was not disposed
of until the clocks struck three in the morning.
“And now we have done, Sydney, fill a bumper of punch,” said Mr.
Stryver.
The jackal removed the towels from his head, which had been steaming again, shook himself, yawned, shivered, and complied.
“You were very sound, Sydney, in the matter of those crown witnesses to-day. Every question told.”
“I always am sound; am I not?”
“I don’t gainsay it. What has roughened your temper? Put some
punch to it and smooth it again.”
With a deprecatory grunt, the jackal again complied.
“The old Sydney Carton of old Shrewsbury School,” said Stryver,
nodding his head over him as he reviewed him in the present and the
past, “the old seesaw Sydney. Up one minute and down the next; now
in spirits and now in despondency!”
“Ah!” returned the other, sighing: “yes! The same Sydney, with the
same luck. Even then, I did exercises for other boys, and seldom did my
77
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
own.
“And why not?”
“God knows. It was my way, I suppose.”
He sat, with his hands in his pockets and his legs stretched out before
him, looking at the fire.
“Carton,” said his friend, squaring himself at him with a bullying air,
as if the fire-grate had been the furnace in which sustained endeavour
was forged, and the one delicate thing to be done for the old Sydney Carton of old Shrewsbury School was to shoulder him into it, “your way
is, and always was, a lame way. You summon no energy and purpose.
Look at me.”
“Oh, botheration!” returned Sydney, with a lighter and more goodhumoured laugh, “don’t you be moral!”
“How have I done what I have done?” said Stryver; “how do I do
what I do?”
“Partly through paying me to help you, I suppose. But it’s not worth
your while to apostrophise me, or the air, about it; what you want to do,
you do. You were always in the front rank, and I was always behind.”
“I had to get into the front rank; I was not born there, was I?”
“I was not present at the ceremony; but my opinion is you were,”
said Carton. At this, he laughed again, and they both laughed.
“Before Shrewsbury, and at Shrewsbury, and ever since Shrewsbury,”
pursued Carton, “you have fallen into your rank, and I have fallen into
mine. Even when we were fellow-students in the Student-Quarter of
Paris, picking up French, and French law, and other French crumbs that
we didn’t get much good of, you were always somewhere, and I was
always nowhere.”
“And whose fault was that?”
“Upon my soul, I am not sure that it was not yours. You were always
driving and riving and shouldering and passing, to that restless degree
that I had no chance for my life but in rust and repose. It’s a gloomy
thing, however, to talk about one’s own past, with the day breaking.
Turn me in some other direction before I go.”
“Well then! Pledge me to the pretty witness,” said Stryver, holding
up his glass. “Are you turned in a pleasant direction?”
Apparently not, for he became gloomy again.
“Pretty witness,” he muttered, looking down into his glass. “I have
had enough of witnesses to-day and to-night; who’s your pretty witness?”
78
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
“The picturesque doctor’s daughter, Miss Manette.”
“She pretty?”
“Is she not?”
“No.”
“Why, man alive, she was the admiration of the whole Court!”
“Rot the admiration of the whole Court! Who made the Old Bailey
a judge of beauty? She was a golden-haired doll!”
“Do you know, Sydney,” said Mr. Stryver, looking at him with sharp
eyes, and slowly drawing a hand across his florid face: “do you know, I
rather thought, at the time, that you sympathised with the golden-haired
doll, and were quick to see what happened to the golden-haired doll?”
“Quick to see what happened! If a girl, doll or no doll, swoons
within a yard or two of a man’s nose, he can see it without a perspectiveglass. I pledge you, but I deny the beauty. And now I’ll have no more
drink; I’ll get to bed.”
When his host followed him out on the staircase with a candle, to
light him down the stairs, the day was coldly looking in through its
grimy windows. When he got out of the house, the air was cold and
sad, the dull sky overcast, the river dark and dim, the whole scene like
a lifeless desert. And wreaths of dust were spinning round and round
before the morning blast, as if the desert-sand had risen far away, and
the first spray of it in its advance had begun to overwhelm the city.
Waste forces within him, and a desert all around, this man stood
still on his way across a silent terrace, and saw for a moment, lying in
the wilderness before him, a mirage of honourable ambition, self-denial,
and perseverance. In the fair city of this vision, there were airy galleries
from which the loves and graces looked upon him, gardens in which the
fruits of life hung ripening, waters of Hope that sparkled in his sight.
A moment, and it was gone. Climbing to a high chamber in a well of
houses, he threw himself down in his clothes on a neglected bed, and its
pillow was wet with wasted tears.
Sadly, sadly, the sun rose; it rose upon no sadder sight than the man
of good abilities and good emotions, incapable of their directed exercise,
incapable of his own help and his own happiness, sensible of the blight
on him, and resigning himself to let it eat him away.

Chapter 6
Hundreds of People
The quiet lodgings of Doctor Manette were in a quiet street-corner not
far from Soho-square. On the afternoon of a certain fine Sunday when
the waves of four months had roiled over the trial for treason, and
carried it, as to the public interest and memory, far out to sea, Mr. Jarvis
Lorry walked along the sunny streets from Clerkenwell where he lived,
on his way to dine with the Doctor. After several relapses into businessabsorption, Mr. Lorry had become the Doctor’s friend, and the quiet
street-corner was the sunny part of his life.
On this certain fine Sunday, Mr. Lorry walked towards Soho, early
in the afternoon, for three reasons of habit. Firstly, because, on fine
Sundays, he often walked out, before dinner, with the Doctor and Lucie;
secondly, because, on unfavourable Sundays, he was accustomed to be
with them as the family friend, talking, reading, looking out of window,
and generally getting through the day; thirdly, because he happened to
have his own little shrewd doubts to solve, and knew how the ways of
the Doctor’s household pointed to that time as a likely time for solving
them.
A quainter corner than the corner where the Doctor lived, was not
to be found in London. There was no way through it, and the front
windows of the Doctor’s lodgings commanded a pleasant little vista of
street that had a congenial air of retirement on it. There were few buildings then, north of the Oxford-road, and forest-trees flourished, and
wild flowers grew, and the hawthorn blossomed, in the now vanished
fields. As a consequence, country airs circulated in Soho with vigorous
freedom, instead of languishing into the parish like stray paupers without a settlement; and there was many a good south wall, not far off, on
which the peaches ripened in their season.
The summer light struck into the corner brilliantly in the earlier part
of the day; but, when the streets grew hot, the corner was in shadow,
though not in shadow so remote but that you could see beyond it into
a glare of brightness. It was a cool spot, staid but cheerful, a wonderful
place for echoes, and a very harbour from the raging streets.
There ought to have been a tranquil bark in such an anchorage, and
there was. The Doctor occupied two floors of a large stiff house, where
several callings purported to be pursued by day, but whereof little was
80
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
audible any day, and which was shunned by all of them at night. In
a building at the back, attainable by a courtyard where a plane-tree
rustled its green leaves, church-organs claimed to be made, and silver
to be chased, and likewise gold to be beaten by some mysterious giant
who had a golden arm starting out of the wall of the front hall—as if
he had beaten himself precious, and menaced a similar conversion of
all visitors. Very little of these trades, or of a lonely lodger rumoured
to live up-stairs, or of a dim coach-trimming maker asserted to have
a counting-house below, was ever heard or seen. Occasionally, a stray
workman putting his coat on, traversed the hall, or a stranger peered
about there, or a distant clink was heard across the courtyard, or a
thump from the golden giant. These, however, were only the exceptions
required to prove the rule that the sparrows in the plane-tree behind the
house, and the echoes in the corner before it, had their own way from
Sunday morning unto Saturday night.
Doctor Manette received such patients here as his old reputation,
and its revival in the floating whispers of his story, brought him. His scientific knowledge, and his vigilance and skill in conducting ingenious experiments, brought him otherwise into moderate request, and he earned
as much as he wanted.
These things were within Mr. Jarvis Lorry’s knowledge, thoughts,
and notice, when he rang the door-bell of the tranquil house in the
corner, on the fine Sunday afternoon.
“Doctor Manette at home?”
Expected home.
“Miss Lucie at home?”
Expected home.
“Miss Pross at home?”
Possibly at home, but of a certainty impossible for handmaid to anticipate intentions of Miss Pross, as to admission or denial of the fact.
“As I am at home myself,” said Mr. Lorry, “I’ll go upstairs.”
Although the Doctor’s daughter had known nothing of the country
of her birth, she appeared to have innately derived from it that ability
to make much of little means, which is one of its most useful and most
agreeable characteristics. Simple as the furniture was, it was set off by so
many little adornments, of no value but for their taste and fancy, that its
effect was delightful. The disposition of everything in the rooms, from
the largest object to the least; the arrangement of colours, the elegant
variety and contrast obtained by thrift in trifles, by delicate hands, clear
81
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
eyes, and good sense; were at once so pleasant in themselves, and so
expressive of their originator, that, as Mr. Lorry stood looking about
him, the very chairs and tables seemed to ask him, with something of
that peculiar expression which he knew so well by this time, whether he
approved?
There were three rooms on a floor, and, the doors by which they
communicated being put open that the air might pass freely through
them all, Mr. Lorry, smilingly observant of that fanciful resemblance
which he detected all around him, walked from one to another. The first
was the best room, and in it were Lucie’s birds, and flowers, and books,
and desk, and work-table, and box of water-colours; the second was
the Doctor’s consulting-room, used also as the dining-room; the third,
changingly speckled by the rustle of the plane-tree in the yard, was the
Doctor’s bedroom, and there, in a corner, stood the disused shoemaker’s
bench and tray of tools, much as it had stood on the fifth floor of the
dismal house by the wine-shop, in the suburb of Saint Antoine in Paris.
“I wonder,” said Mr. Lorry, pausing in his looking about, “that he
keeps that reminder of his sufferings about him!”
“And why wonder at that?” was the abrupt inquiry that made him
start.
It proceeded from Miss Pross, the wild red woman, strong of hand,
whose acquaintance he had first made at the Royal George Hotel at
Dover, and had since improved.
“I should have thought—” Mr. Lorry began.
“Pooh! You’d have thought!” said Miss Pross; and Mr. Lorry left
off.
“How do you do?” inquired that lady then—sharply, and yet as if
to express that she bore him no malice.
“I am pretty well, I thank you,” answered Mr. Lorry, with meekness;
“how are you?”
“Nothing to boast of,” said Miss Pross.
“Indeed?”
“Ah! indeed!” said Miss Pross. “I am very much put out about my
Ladybird.”
“Indeed?”
“For gracious sake say something else besides ‘indeed,’ or you’ll fidget me to death,” said Miss Pross: whose character (dissociated from
stature) was shortness.
“Really, then?” said Mr. Lorry, as an amendment.
82
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
“Really, is bad enough,” returned Miss Pross, “but better. Yes, I am
very much put out.”
“May I ask the cause?”
“I don’t want dozens of people who are not at all worthy of Ladybird, to come here looking after her,” said Miss Pross.
“Do dozens come for that purpose?”
“Hundreds,” said Miss Pross.
It was characteristic of this lady (as of some other people before her
time and since) that whenever her original proposition was questioned,
she exaggerated it.
“Dear me!” said Mr. Lorry, as the safest remark he could think of.
“I have lived with the darling—or the darling has lived with me, and
paid me for it; which she certainly should never have done, you may
take your affidavit, if I could have afforded to keep either myself or her
for nothing—since she was ten years old. And it’s really very hard,” said
Miss Pross.
Not seeing with precision what was very hard, Mr. Lorry shook his
head; using that important part of himself as a sort of fairy cloak that
would fit anything.
“All sorts of people who are not in the least degree worthy of the
pet, are always turning up,” said Miss Pross. “When you began it—”
“I began it, Miss Pross?”
“Didn’t you? Who brought her father to life?”
“Oh! If that was beginning it—” said Mr. Lorry.
“It wasn’t ending it, I suppose? I say, when you began it, it was hard
enough; not that I have any fault to find with Doctor Manette, except
that he is not worthy of such a daughter, which is no imputation on
him, for it was not to be expected that anybody should be, under any
circumstances. But it really is doubly and trebly hard to have crowds
and multitudes of people turning up after him (I could have forgiven
him), to take Ladybird’s affections away from me.”
Mr. Lorry knew Miss Pross to be very jealous, but he also knew her
by this time to be, beneath the service of her eccentricity, one of those
unselfish creatures—found only among women—who will, for pure love
and admiration, bind themselves willing slaves, to youth when they have
lost it, to beauty that they never had, to accomplishments that they were
never fortunate enough to gain, to bright hopes that never shone upon
their own sombre lives. He knew enough of the world to know that
there is nothing in it better than the faithful service of the heart; so
83
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
rendered and so free from any mercenary taint, he had such an exalted
respect for it, that in the retributive arrangements made by his own
mind—we all make such arrangements, more or less—he stationed Miss
Pross much nearer to the lower Angels than many ladies immeasurably
better got up both by Nature and Art, who had balances at Tellson’s.
“There never was, nor will be, but one man worthy of Ladybird,”
said Miss Pross; “and that was my brother Solomon, if he hadn’t made
a mistake in life.”
Here again: Mr. Lorry’s inquiries into Miss Pross’s personal history had established the fact that her brother Solomon was a heartless
scoundrel who had stripped her of everything she possessed, as a stake
to speculate with, and had abandoned her in her poverty for evermore,
with no touch of compunction. Miss Pross’s fidelity of belief in Solomon
(deducting a mere trifle for this slight mistake) was quite a serious matter with Mr. Lorry, and had its weight in his good opinion of her.
“As we happen to be alone for the moment, and are both people
of business,” he said, when they had got back to the drawing-room
and had sat down there in friendly relations, “let me ask you—does the
Doctor, in talking with Lucie, never refer to the shoemaking time, yet?”
“Never.”
“And yet keeps that bench and those tools beside him?”
“Ah!” returned Miss Pross, shaking her head. “But I don’t say he
don’t refer to it within himself.”
“Do you believe that he thinks of it much?”
“I do,” said Miss Pross.
“Do you imagine—” Mr. Lorry had begun, when Miss Pross took
him up short with:
“Never imagine anything. Have no imagination at all.”
“I stand corrected; do you suppose—you go so far as to suppose,
sometimes?”
“Now and then,” said Miss Pross.
“Do you suppose,” Mr. Lorry went on, with a laughing twinkle in
his bright eye, as it looked kindly at her, “that Doctor Manette has
any theory of his own, preserved through all those years, relative to
the cause of his being so oppressed; perhaps, even to the name of his
oppressor?”
“I don’t suppose anything about it but what Ladybird tells me.”
“And that is—?”
“That she thinks he has.”
84
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
“Now don’t be angry at my asking all these questions; because I am
a mere dull man of business, and you are a woman of business.”
“Dull?” Miss Pross inquired, with placidity.
Rather wishing his modest adjective away, Mr. Lorry replied, “No,
no, no. Surely not. To return to business:—Is it not remarkable that
Doctor Manette, unquestionably innocent of any crime as we are all
well assured he is, should never touch upon that question? I will not say
with me, though he had business relations with me many years ago, and
we are now intimate; I will say with the fair daughter to whom he is so
devotedly attached, and who is so devotedly attached to him? Believe
me, Miss Pross, I don’t approach the topic with you, out of curiosity,
but out of zealous interest.”
“Well! To the best of my understanding, and bad’s the best, you’ll
tell me,” said Miss Pross, softened by the tone of the apology, “he is
afraid of the whole subject.”
“Afraid?”
“It’s plain enough, I should think, why he may be. It’s a dreadful
remembrance. Besides that, his loss of himself grew out of it. Not
knowing how he lost himself, or how he recovered himself, he may
never feel certain of not losing himself again. That alone wouldn’t make
the subject pleasant, I should think.”
It was a profounder remark than Mr. Lorry had looked for. “True,”
said he, “and fearful to reflect upon. Yet, a doubt lurks in my mind,
Miss Pross, whether it is good for Doctor Manette to have that suppression always shut up within him. Indeed, it is this doubt and the
uneasiness it sometimes causes me that has led me to our present confidence.”
“Can’t be helped,” said Miss Pross, shaking her head. “Touch that
string, and he instantly changes for the worse. Better leave it alone. In
short, must leave it alone, like or no like. Sometimes, he gets up in the
dead of the night, and will be heard, by us overhead there, walking up
and down, walking up and down, in his room. Ladybird has learnt to
know then that his mind is walking up and down, walking up and down,
in his old prison. She hurries to him, and they go on together, walking
up and down, walking up and down, until he is composed. But he never
says a word of the true reason of his restlessness, to her, and she finds
it best not to hint at it to him. In silence they go walking up and down
together, walking up and down together, till her love and company have
brought him to himself.”
85
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
Notwithstanding Miss Pross’s denial of her own imagination, there
was a perception of the pain of being monotonously haunted by one
sad idea, in her repetition of the phrase, walking up and down, which
testified to her possessing such a thing.
The corner has been mentioned as a wonderful corner for echoes; it
had begun to echo so resoundingly to the tread of coming feet, that it
seemed as though the very mention of that weary pacing to and fro had
set it going.
“Here they are!” said Miss Pross, rising to break up the conference;
“and now we shall have hundreds of people pretty soon!”
It was such a curious corner in its acoustical properties, such a peculiar Ear of a place, that as Mr. Lorry stood at the open window, looking for the father and daughter whose steps he heard, he fancied they
would never approach. Not only would the echoes die away, as though
the steps had gone; but, echoes of other steps that never came would be
heard in their stead, and would die away for good when they seemed
close at hand. However, father and daughter did at last appear, and
Miss Pross was ready at the street door to receive them.
Miss Pross was a pleasant sight, albeit wild, and red, and grim, taking off her darling’s bonnet when she came up-stairs, and touching it up
with the ends of her handkerchief, and blowing the dust off it, and folding her mantle ready for laying by, and smoothing her rich hair with as
much pride as she could possibly have taken in her own hair if she had
been the vainest and handsomest of women. Her darling was a pleasant sight too, embracing her and thanking her, and protesting against
her taking so much trouble for her—which last she only dared to do
playfully, or Miss Pross, sorely hurt, would have retired to her own
chamber and cried. The Doctor was a pleasant sight too, looking on at
them, and telling Miss Pross how she spoilt Lucie, in accents and with
eyes that had as much spoiling in them as Miss Pross had, and would
have had more if it were possible. Mr. Lorry was a pleasant sight too,
beaming at all this in his little wig, and thanking his bachelor stars for
having lighted him in his declining years to a Home. But, no Hundreds
of people came to see the sights, and Mr. Lorry looked in vain for the
fulfilment of Miss Pross’s prediction.
Dinner-time, and still no Hundreds of people. In the arrangements
of the little household, Miss Pross took charge of the lower regions, and
always acquitted herself marvellously. Her dinners, of a very modest
quality, were so well cooked and so well served, and so neat in their
86
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
contrivances, half English and half French, that nothing could be better. Miss Pross’s friendship being of the thoroughly practical kind, she
had ravaged Soho and the adjacent provinces, in search of impoverished French, who, tempted by shillings and half-crowns, would impart
culinary mysteries to her. From these decayed sons and daughters of
Gaul, she had acquired such wonderful arts, that the woman and girl
who formed the staff of domestics regarded her as quite a Sorceress, or
Cinderella’s Godmother: who would send out for a fowl, a rabbit, a
vegetable or two from the garden, and change them into anything she
pleased.
On Sundays, Miss Pross dined at the Doctor’s table, but on other
days persisted in taking her meals at unknown periods, either in the
lower regions, or in her own room on the second floor—a blue chamber, to which no one but her Ladybird ever gained admittance. On this
occasion, Miss Pross, responding to Ladybird’s pleasant face and pleasant efforts to please her, unbent exceedingly; so the dinner was very
pleasant, too.
It was an oppressive day, and, after dinner, Lucie proposed that the
wine should be carried out under the plane-tree, and they should sit
there in the air. As everything turned upon her, and revolved about her,
they went out under the plane-tree, and she carried the wine down for
the special benefit of Mr. Lorry. She had installed herself, some time
before, as Mr. Lorry’s cup-bearer; and while they sat under the planetree, talking, she kept his glass replenished. Mysterious backs and ends
of houses peeped at them as they talked, and the plane-tree whispered
to them in its own way above their heads.
Still, the Hundreds of people did not present themselves. Mr. Darnay
presented himself while they were sitting under the plane-tree, but he
was only One.
Doctor Manette received him kindly, and so did Lucie. But, Miss
Pross suddenly became afflicted with a twitching in the head and body,
and retired into the house. She was not unfrequently the victim of this
disorder, and she called it, in familiar conversation, “a fit of the jerks.”
The Doctor was in his best condition, and looked specially young.
The resemblance between him and Lucie was very strong at such times,
and as they sat side by side, she leaning on his shoulder, and he resting
his arm on the back of her chair, it was very agreeable to trace the
likeness.
He had been talking all day, on many subjects, and with unusual
87
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
vivacity. “Pray, Doctor Manette,” said Mr. Darnay, as they sat under
the plane-tree—and he said it in the natural pursuit of the topic in hand,
which happened to be the old buildings of London—“have you seen
much of the Tower?”
“Lucie and I have been there; but only casually. We have seen
enough of it, to know that it teems with interest; little more.”
“I have been there, as you remember,” said Darnay, with a smile,
though reddening a little angrily, “in another character, and not in a
character that gives facilities for seeing much of it. They told me a
curious thing when I was there.”
“What was that?” Lucie asked.
“In making some alterations, the workmen came upon an old dungeon, which had been, for many years, built up and forgotten. Every
stone of its inner wall was covered by inscriptions which had been
carved by prisoners—dates, names, complaints, and prayers. Upon a
corner stone in an angle of the wall, one prisoner, who seemed to have
gone to execution, had cut as his last work, three letters. They were
done with some very poor instrument, and hurriedly, with an unsteady
hand. At first, they were read as D. I. C.; but, on being more carefully
examined, the last letter was found to be G. There was no record or legend of any prisoner with those initials, and many fruitless guesses were
made what the name could have been. At length, it was suggested that
the letters were not initials, but the complete word, DiG. The floor was
examined very carefully under the inscription, and, in the earth beneath
a stone, or tile, or some fragment of paving, were found the ashes of a
paper, mingled with the ashes of a small leathern case or bag. What the
unknown prisoner had written will never be read, but he had written
something, and hidden it away to keep it from the gaoler.”
“My father,” exclaimed Lucie, “you are ill!”
He had suddenly started up, with his hand to his head. His manner
and his look quite terrified them all.
“No, my dear, not ill. There are large drops of rain falling, and they
made me start. We had better go in.”
He recovered himself almost instantly. Rain was really falling in
large drops, and he showed the back of his hand with rain-drops on it.
But, he said not a single word in reference to the discovery that had been
told of, and, as they went into the house, the business eye of Mr. Lorry
either detected, or fancied it detected, on his face, as it turned towards
Charles Darnay, the same singular look that had been upon it when it
88
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
turned towards him in the passages of the Court House.
He recovered himself so quickly, however, that Mr. Lorry had doubts
of his business eye. The arm of the golden giant in the hall was not more
steady than he was, when he stopped under it to remark to them that
he was not yet proof against slight surprises (if he ever would be), and
that the rain had startled him.
Tea-time, and Miss Pross making tea, with another fit of the jerks
upon her, and yet no Hundreds of people. Mr. Carton had lounged in,
but he made only Two.
The night was so very sultry, that although they sat with doors and
windows open, they were overpowered by heat. When the tea-table
was done with, they all moved to one of the windows, and looked out
into the heavy twilight. Lucie sat by her father; Darnay sat beside her;
Carton leaned against a window. The curtains were long and white, and
some of the thunder-gusts that whirled into the corner, caught them up
to the ceiling, and waved them like spectral wings.
“The rain-drops are still falling, large, heavy, and few,” said Doctor
Manette. “It comes slowly.”
“It comes surely,” said Carton.
They spoke low, as people watching and waiting mostly do; as people in a dark room, watching and waiting for Lightning, always do.
There was a great hurry in the streets of people speeding away to
get shelter before the storm broke; the wonderful corner for echoes resounded with the echoes of footsteps coming and going, yet not a footstep was there.
“A multitude of people, and yet a solitude!” said Darnay, when they
had listened for a while.
“Is it not impressive, Mr. Darnay?” asked Lucie. “Sometimes, I
have sat here of an evening, until I have fancied—but even the shade
of a foolish fancy makes me shudder to-night, when all is so black and
solemn—”
“Let us shudder too. We may know what it is.”
“It will seem nothing to you. Such whims are only impressive as
we originate them, I think; they are not to be communicated. I have
sometimes sat alone here of an evening, listening, until I have made the
echoes out to be the echoes of all the footsteps that are coming by-andbye into our lives.”
“There is a great crowd coming one day into our lives, if that be so,”
Sydney Carton struck in, in his moody way.
89
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
The footsteps were incessant, and the hurry of them became more
and more rapid. The corner echoed and re-echoed with the tread of feet;
some, as it seemed, under the windows; some, as it seemed, in the room;
some coming, some going, some breaking off, some stopping altogether;
all in the distant streets, and not one within sight.
“Are all these footsteps destined to come to all of us, Miss Manette,
or are we to divide them among us?”
“I don’t know, Mr. Darnay; I told you it was a foolish fancy, but you
asked for it. When I have yielded myself to it, I have been alone, and
then I have imagined them the footsteps of the people who are to come
into my life, and my father’s.”
“I take them into mine!” said Carton. “I ask no questions and make
no stipulations. There is a great crowd bearing down upon us, Miss
Manette, and I see them—by the Lightning.” He added the last words,
after there had been a vivid flash which had shown him lounging in the
window.
“And I hear them!” he added again, after a peal of thunder. “Here
they come, fast, fierce, and furious!”
It was the rush and roar of rain that he typified, and it stopped him,
for no voice could be heard in it. A memorable storm of thunder and
lightning broke with that sweep of water, and there was not a moment’s
interval in crash, and fire, and rain, until after the moon rose at midnight.
The great bell of Saint Paul’s was striking one in the cleared air, when
Mr. Lorry, escorted by Jerry, high-booted and bearing a lantern, set forth
on his return-passage to Clerkenwell. There were solitary patches of
road on the way between Soho and Clerkenwell, and Mr. Lorry, mindful
of foot-pads, always retained Jerry for this service: though it was usually
performed a good two hours earlier.
“What a night it has been! Almost a night, Jerry,” said Mr. Lorry,
“to bring the dead out of their graves.”
“I never see the night myself, master—nor yet I don’t expect to—
what would do that,” answered Jerry.
“Good night, Mr. Carton,” said the man of business. “Good night,
Mr. Darnay. Shall we ever see such a night again, together!”
Perhaps. Perhaps, see the great crowd of people with its rush and
roar, bearing down upon them, too.

Chapter 7
Monseigneur in Town
Monseigneur, one of the great lords in power at the Court, held his
fortnightly reception in his grand hotel in Paris. Monseigneur was in
his inner room, his sanctuary of sanctuaries, the Holiest of Holiests to
the crowd of worshippers in the suite of rooms without. Monseigneur
was about to take his chocolate. Monseigneur could swallow a great
many things with ease, and was by some few sullen minds supposed to
be rather rapidly swallowing France; but, his morning’s chocolate could
not so much as get into the throat of Monseigneur, without the aid of
four strong men besides the Cook.
Yes. It took four men, all four ablaze with gorgeous decoration, and
the Chief of them unable to exist with fewer than two gold watches
in his pocket, emulative of the noble and chaste fashion set by Monseigneur, to conduct the happy chocolate to Monseigneur’s lips. One
lacquey carried the chocolate-pot into the sacred presence; a second,
milled and frothed the chocolate with the little instrument he bore for
that function; a third, presented the favoured napkin; a fourth (he of
the two gold watches), poured the chocolate out. It was impossible for
Monseigneur to dispense with one of these attendants on the chocolate
and hold his high place under the admiring Heavens. Deep would have
been the blot upon his escutcheon if his chocolate had been ignobly
waited on by only three men; he must have died of two.
Monseigneur had been out at a little supper last night, where the
Comedy and the Grand Opera were charmingly represented. Monseigneur was out at a little supper most nights, with fascinating company. So polite and so impressible was Monseigneur, that the Comedy
and the Grand Opera had far more influence with him in the tiresome
articles of state affairs and state secrets, than the needs of all France. A
happy circumstance for France, as the like always is for all countries
similarly favoured!—always was for England (by way of example), in
the regretted days of the merry Stuart who sold it.
Monseigneur had one truly noble idea of general public business,
which was, to let everything go on in its own way; of particular public
business, Monseigneur had the other truly noble idea that it must all
go his way—tend to his own power and pocket. Of his pleasures, general and particular, Monseigneur had the other truly noble idea, that

A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
the world was made for them. The text of his order (altered from the
original by only a pronoun, which is not much) ran: “The earth and the
fulness thereof are mine, saith Monseigneur.”
Yet, Monseigneur had slowly found that vulgar embarrassments
crept into his affairs, both private and public; and he had, as to both
classes of affairs, allied himself perforce with a Farmer-General. As to
finances public, because Monseigneur could not make anything at all of
them, and must consequently let them out to somebody who could; as to
finances private, because Farmer-Generals were rich, and Monseigneur,
after generations of great luxury and expense, was growing poor. Hence
Monseigneur had taken his sister from a convent, while there was yet
time to ward off the impending veil, the cheapest garment she could
wear, and had bestowed her as a prize upon a very rich Farmer-General,
poor in family. Which Farmer-General, carrying an appropriate cane
with a golden apple on the top of it, was now among the company in
the outer rooms, much prostrated before by mankind—always excepting superior mankind of the blood of Monseigneur, who, his own wife
included, looked down upon him with the loftiest contempt.
A sumptuous man was the Farmer-General. Thirty horses stood in
his stables, twenty-four male domestics sat in his halls, six body-women
waited on his wife. As one who pretended to do nothing but plunder
and forage where he could, the Farmer-General—howsoever his matrimonial relations conduced to social morality—was at least the greatest
reality among the personages who attended at the hotel of Monseigneur
that day.
For, the rooms, though a beautiful scene to look at, and adorned
with every device of decoration that the taste and skill of the time could
achieve, were, in truth, not a sound business; considered with any reference to the scarecrows in the rags and nightcaps elsewhere (and not
so far off, either, but that the watching towers of Notre Dame, almost
equidistant from the two extremes, could see them both), they would
have been an exceedingly uncomfortable business—if that could have
been anybody’s business, at the house of Monseigneur. Military officers destitute of military knowledge; naval officers with no idea of a
ship; civil officers without a notion of affairs; brazen ecclesiastics, of
the worst world worldly, with sensual eyes, loose tongues, and looser
lives; all totally unfit for their several callings, all lying horribly in pretending to belong to them, but all nearly or remotely of the order of
Monseigneur, and therefore foisted on all public employments from
92
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
which anything was to be got; these were to be told off by the score
and the score. People not immediately connected with Monseigneur
or the State, yet equally unconnected with anything that was real, or
with lives passed in travelling by any straight road to any true earthly
end, were no less abundant. Doctors who made great fortunes out of
dainty remedies for imaginary disorders that never existed, smiled upon
their courtly patients in the ante-chambers of Monseigneur. Projectors
who had discovered every kind of remedy for the little evils with which
the State was touched, except the remedy of setting to work in earnest
to root out a single sin, poured their distracting babble into any ears
they could lay hold of, at the reception of Monseigneur. Unbelieving
Philosophers who were remodelling the world with words, and making
card-towers of Babel to scale the skies with, talked with Unbelieving
Chemists who had an eye on the transmutation of metals, at this wonderful gathering accumulated by Monseigneur. Exquisite gentlemen of
the finest breeding, which was at that remarkable time—and has been
since—to be known by its fruits of indifference to every natural subject
of human interest, were in the most exemplary state of exhaustion, at
the hotel of Monseigneur. Such homes had these various notabilities
left behind them in the fine world of Paris, that the spies among the
assembled devotees of Monseigneur—forming a goodly half of the polite company—would have found it hard to discover among the angels
of that sphere one solitary wife, who, in her manners and appearance,
owned to being a Mother. Indeed, except for the mere act of bringing
a troublesome creature into this world—which does not go far towards
the realisation of the name of mother—there was no such thing known
to the fashion. Peasant women kept the unfashionable babies close, and
brought them up, and charming grandmammas of sixty dressed and
supped as at twenty.
The leprosy of unreality disfigured every human creature in attendance upon Monseigneur. In the outermost room were half a dozen
exceptional people who had had, for a few years, some vague misgiving
in them that things in general were going rather wrong. As a promising
way of setting them right, half of the half-dozen had become members of
a fantastic sect of Convulsionists, and were even then considering within
themselves whether they should foam, rage, roar, and turn cataleptic on
the spot—thereby setting up a highly intelligible finger-post to the Future, for Monseigneur’s guidance. Besides these Dervishes, were other
three who had rushed into another sect, which mended matters with a
93
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
jargon about “the Centre of Truth:” holding that Man had got out of
the Centre of Truth—which did not need much demonstration—but had
not got out of the Circumference, and that he was to be kept from flying
out of the Circumference, and was even to be shoved back into the Centre, by fasting and seeing of spirits. Among these, accordingly, much
discoursing with spirits went on—and it did a world of good which
never became manifest.
But, the comfort was, that all the company at the grand hotel of
Monseigneur were perfectly dressed. If the Day of Judgment had only
been ascertained to be a dress day, everybody there would have been
eternally correct. Such frizzling and powdering and sticking up of hair,
such delicate complexions artificially preserved and mended, such gallant swords to look at, and such delicate honour to the sense of smell,
would surely keep anything going, for ever and ever. The exquisite gentlemen of the finest breeding wore little pendent trinkets that chinked as
they languidly moved; these golden fetters rang like precious little bells;
and what with that ringing, and with the rustle of silk and brocade and
fine linen, there was a flutter in the air that fanned Saint Antoine and
his devouring hunger far away.
Dress was the one unfailing talisman and charm used for keeping
all things in their places. Everybody was dressed for a Fancy Ball that
was never to leave off. From the Palace of the Tuileries, through Monseigneur and the whole Court, through the Chambers, the Tribunals of
Justice, and all society (except the scarecrows), the Fancy Ball descended
to the Common Executioner: who, in pursuance of the charm, was required to officiate “frizzled, powdered, in a gold-laced coat, pumps, and
white silk stockings.” At the gallows and the wheel—the axe was a
rarity—Monsieur Paris, as it was the episcopal mode among his brother
Professors of the provinces, Monsieur Orleans, and the rest, to call him,
presided in this dainty dress. And who among the company at Monseigneur’s reception in that seventeen hundred and eightieth year of our
Lord, could possibly doubt, that a system rooted in a frizzled hangman,
powdered, gold-laced, pumped, and white-silk stockinged, would see
the very stars out!
Monseigneur having eased his four men of their burdens and taken
his chocolate, caused the doors of the Holiest of Holiests to be thrown
open, and issued forth. Then, what submission, what cringing and fawning, what servility, what abject humiliation! As to bowing down in body
and spirit, nothing in that way was left for Heaven—which may have
94
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
been one among other reasons why the worshippers of Monseigneur
never troubled it.
Bestowing a word of promise here and a smile there, a whisper on
one happy slave and a wave of the hand on another, Monseigneur affably passed through his rooms to the remote region of the Circumference
of Truth. There, Monseigneur turned, and came back again, and so in
due course of time got himself shut up in his sanctuary by the chocolate
sprites, and was seen no more.
The show being over, the flutter in the air became quite a little storm,
and the precious little bells went ringing downstairs. There was soon
but one person left of all the crowd, and he, with his hat under his arm
and his snuff-box in his hand, slowly passed among the mirrors on his
way out.
“I devote you,” said this person, stopping at the last door on his way,
and turning in the direction of the sanctuary, “to the Devil!”
With that, he shook the snuff from his fingers as if he had shaken
the dust from his feet, and quietly walked downstairs.
He was a man of about sixty, handsomely dressed, haughty in manner, and with a face like a fine mask. A face of a transparent paleness;
every feature in it clearly defined; one set expression on it. The nose,
beautifully formed otherwise, was very slightly pinched at the top of
each nostril. In those two compressions, or dints, the only little change
that the face ever showed, resided. They persisted in changing colour
sometimes, and they would be occasionally dilated and contracted by
something like a faint pulsation; then, they gave a look of treachery,
and cruelty, to the whole countenance. Examined with attention, its capacity of helping such a look was to be found in the line of the mouth,
and the lines of the orbits of the eyes, being much too horizontal and
thin; still, in the effect of the face made, it was a handsome face, and a
remarkable one.
Its owner went downstairs into the courtyard, got into his carriage,
and drove away. Not many people had talked with him at the reception;
he had stood in a little space apart, and Monseigneur might have been
warmer in his manner. It appeared, under the circumstances, rather
agreeable to him to see the common people dispersed before his horses,
and often barely escaping from being run down. His man drove as if
he were charging an enemy, and the furious recklessness of the man
brought no check into the face, or to the lips, of the master. The complaint had sometimes made itself audible, even in that deaf city and
95
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
dumb age, that, in the narrow streets without footways, the fierce patrician custom of hard driving endangered and maimed the mere vulgar
in a barbarous manner. But, few cared enough for that to think of it a
second time, and, in this matter, as in all others, the common wretches
were left to get out of their difficulties as they could.
With a wild rattle and clatter, and an inhuman abandonment of consideration not easy to be understood in these days, the carriage dashed
through streets and swept round corners, with women screaming before
it, and men clutching each other and clutching children out of its way.
At last, swooping at a street corner by a fountain, one of its wheels
came to a sickening little jolt, and there was a loud cry from a number
of voices, and the horses reared and plunged.
But for the latter inconvenience, the carriage probably would not
have stopped; carriages were often known to drive on, and leave their
wounded behind, and why not? But the frightened valet had got down
in a hurry, and there were twenty hands at the horses’ bridles.
“What has gone wrong?” said Monsieur, calmly looking out.
A tall man in a nightcap had caught up a bundle from among the
feet of the horses, and had laid it on the basement of the fountain, and
was down in the mud and wet, howling over it like a wild animal.
“Pardon, Monsieur the Marquis!” said a ragged and submissive
man, “it is a child.”
“Why does he make that abominable noise? Is it his child?”
“Excuse me, Monsieur the Marquis—it is a pity—yes.”
The fountain was a little removed; for the street opened, where it
was, into a space some ten or twelve yards square. As the tall man
suddenly got up from the ground, and came running at the carriage,
Monsieur the Marquis clapped his hand for an instant on his swordhilt.
“Killed!” shrieked the man, in wild desperation, extending both
arms at their length above his head, and staring at him. “Dead!”
The people closed round, and looked at Monsieur the Marquis.
There was nothing revealed by the many eyes that looked at him but
watchfulness and eagerness; there was no visible menacing or anger.
Neither did the people say anything; after the first cry, they had been
silent, and they remained so. The voice of the submissive man who had
spoken, was flat and tame in its extreme submission. Monsieur the Marquis ran his eyes over them all, as if they had been mere rats come out
of their holes.
96
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
He took out his purse.
“It is extraordinary to me,” said he, “that you people cannot take
care of yourselves and your children. One or the other of you is for ever
in the, way. How do I know what injury you have done my horses. See!
Give him that.”
He threw out a gold coin for the valet to pick up, and all the heads
craned forward that all the eyes might look down at it as it fell. The tall
man called out again with a most unearthly cry, “Dead!”
He was arrested by the quick arrival of another man, for whom the
rest made way. On seeing him, the miserable creature fell upon his
shoulder, sobbing and crying, and pointing to the fountain, where some
women were stooping over the motionless bundle, and moving gently
about it. They were as silent, however, as the men.
“I know all, I know all,” said the last comer. “Be a brave man, my
Gaspard! It is better for the poor little plaything to die so, than to live.
It has died in a moment without pain. Could it have lived an hour as
happily?”
“You are a philosopher, you there,” said the, Marquis, smiling.
“How do they call you?”
“They call me Defarge.”
“Of what trade?”
“Monsieur the Marquis, vendor of wine.”
“Pick up that, philosopher and vendor of wine,” said the Marquis,
throwing him another gold coin, “and spend it as you will. The horses
there; are they right?”
Without deigning to look at the assemblage a second time, Monsieur
the Marquis leaned back in his seat, and was just being driven away
with the air of a gentleman who had accidentally broke some common
thing, and had paid for it, and could afford to pay for it; when his ease
was suddenly disturbed by a coin flying into his carriage, and ringing on
its floor.
“Hold!” said Monsieur the Marquis. “Hold the horses! Who threw
that?”
He looked to the spot where Defarge the vendor of wine had stood,
a moment before; but the wretched father was grovelling on his face on
the pavement in that spot, and the figure that stood beside him was the
figure of a dark stout woman, knitting.
“You dogs!” said the Marquis, but smoothly, and with an unchanged front, except as to the spots on his nose: “I would ride over
97
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
any of you very willingly, and exterminate you from the earth. If I knew
which rascal threw at the carriage, and if that brigand were sufficiently
near it, he should be crushed under the wheels.”
So cowed was their condition, and so long and hard their experience
of what such a man could do to them, within the law and beyond it,
that not a voice, or a hand, or even an eye was raised. Among the men,
not one. But the woman who stood knitting looked up steadily, and
looked the Marquis in the face. It was not for his dignity to notice it;
his contemptuous eyes passed over her, and over all the other rats; and
he leaned back in his seat again, and gave the word “Go on!”
He was driven on, and other carriages came whirling by in quick
succession; the Minister, the State-Projector, the Farmer-General, the
Doctor, the Lawyer, the Ecclesiastic, the Grand Opera, the Comedy, the
whole Fancy Ball in a bright continuous flow, came whirling by. The rats
had crept out of their holes to look on, and they remained looking on for
hours; soldiers and police often passing between them and the spectacle,
and making a barrier behind which they slunk, and through which they
peeped. The father had long ago taken up his bundle and bidden himself
away with it, when the women who had tended the bundle while it
lay on the base of the fountain, sat there watching the running of the
water and the rolling of the Fancy Ball—when the one woman who had
stood conspicuous, knitting, still knitted on with the steadfastness of
Fate. The water of the fountain ran, the swift river ran, the day ran into
evening, so much life in the city ran into death according to rule, time
and tide waited for no man, the rats were sleeping close together in their
dark holes again, the Fancy Ball was lighted up at supper, all things ran
their course.
Chapter 8
Monseigneur in the Country
A beautiful landscape, with the corn bright in it, but not abundant.
Patches of poor rye where corn should have been, patches of poor peas
and beans, patches of most coarse vegetable substitutes for wheat. On
inanimate nature, as on the men and women who cultivated it, a prevalent tendency towards an appearance of vegetating unwillingly—a dejected disposition to give up, and wither away.
98
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
Monsieur the Marquis in his travelling carriage (which might have
been lighter), conducted by four post-horses and two postilions, fagged
up a steep hill. A blush on the countenance of Monsieur the Marquis
was no impeachment of his high breeding; it was not from within; it was
occasioned by an external circumstance beyond his control—the setting
sun.
The sunset struck so brilliantly into the travelling carriage when it
gained the hill-top, that its occupant was steeped in crimson. “It will
die out,” said Monsieur the Marquis, glancing at his hands, “directly.”
In effect, the sun was so low that it dipped at the moment. When the
heavy drag had been adjusted to the wheel, and the carriage slid down
hill, with a cinderous smell, in a cloud of dust, the red glow departed
quickly; the sun and the Marquis going down together, there was no
glow left when the drag was taken off.
But, there remained a broken country, bold and open, a little village
at the bottom of the hill, a broad sweep and rise beyond it, a churchtower, a windmill, a forest for the chase, and a crag with a fortress on
it used as a prison. Round upon all these darkening objects as the night
drew on, the Marquis looked, with the air of one who was coming near
home.
The village had its one poor street, with its poor brewery, poor tannery, poor tavern, poor stable-yard for relays of post-horses, poor fountain, all usual poor appointments. It had its poor people too. All its people were poor, and many of them were sitting at their doors, shredding
spare onions and the like for supper, while many were at the fountain,
washing leaves, and grasses, and any such small yieldings of the earth
that could be eaten. Expressive sips of what made them poor, were not
wanting; the tax for the state, the tax for the church, the tax for the lord,
tax local and tax general, were to be paid here and to be paid there, according to solemn inscription in the little village, until the wonder was,
that there was any village left unswallowed.
Few children were to be seen, and no dogs. As to the men and
women, their choice on earth was stated in the prospect—Life on the
lowest terms that could sustain it, down in the little village under the
mill; or captivity and Death in the dominant prison on the crag.
Heralded by a courier in advance, and by the cracking of his postilions’ whips, which twined snake-like about their heads in the evening
air, as if he came attended by the Furies, Monsieur the Marquis drew up
in his travelling carriage at the posting-house gate. It was hard by the
99
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
fountain, and the peasants suspended their operations to look at him.
He looked at them, and saw in them, without knowing it, the slow sure
filing down of misery-worn face and figure, that was to make the meagreness of Frenchmen an English superstition which should survive the
truth through the best part of a hundred years.
Monsieur the Marquis cast his eyes over the submissive faces that
drooped before him, as the like of himself had drooped before Monseigneur of the Court—only the difference was, that these faces drooped
merely to suffer and not to propitiate—when a grizzled mender of the
roads joined the group.
“Bring me hither that fellow!” said the Marquis to the courier.
The fellow was brought, cap in hand, and the other fellows closed
round to look and listen, in the manner of the people at the Paris fountain.
“I passed you on the road?”
“Monseigneur, it is true. I had the honour of being passed on the
road.”
“Coming up the hill, and at the top of the hill, both?”
“Monseigneur, it is true.”
“What did you look at, so fixedly?”
“Monseigneur, I looked at the man.”
He stooped a little, and with his tattered blue cap pointed under the
carriage. All his fellows stooped to look under the carriage.
“What man, pig? And why look there?”
“Pardon, Monseigneur; he swung by the chain of the shoe—the
drag.”
“Who?” demanded the traveller.
“Monseigneur, the man.”
“May the Devil carry away these idiots! How do you call the man?
You know all the men of this part of the country. Who was he?”
“Your clemency, Monseigneur! He was not of this part of the country. Of all the days of my life, I never saw him.”
“Swinging by the chain? To be suffocated?”
“With your gracious permission, that was the wonder of it, Monseigneur. His head hanging over—like this!”
He turned himself sideways to the carriage, and leaned back, with
his face thrown up to the sky, and his head hanging down; then recovered himself, fumbled with his cap, and made a bow.
“What was he like?”
100
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
“Monseigneur, he was whiter than the miller. All covered with dust,
white as a spectre, tall as a spectre!”
The picture produced an immense sensation in the little crowd; but
all eyes, without comparing notes with other eyes, looked at Monsieur
the Marquis. Perhaps, to observe whether he had any spectre on his
conscience.
“Truly, you did well,” said the Marquis, felicitously sensible that
such vermin were not to ruffle him, “to see a thief accompanying my
carriage, and not open that great mouth of yours. Bah! Put him aside,
Monsieur Gabelle!”
Monsieur Gabelle was the Postmaster, and some other taxing functionary united; he had come out with great obsequiousness to assist at
this examination, and had held the examined by the drapery of his arm
in an official manner.
“Bah! Go aside!” said Monsieur Gabelle.
“Lay hands on this stranger if he seeks to lodge in your village tonight, and be sure that his business is honest, Gabelle.”
“Monseigneur, I am flattered to devote myself to your orders.”
“Did he run away, fellow?—where is that Accursed?”
The accursed was already under the carriage with some half-dozen
particular friends, pointing out the chain with his blue cap. Some halfdozen other particular friends promptly hauled him out, and presented
him breathless to Monsieur the Marquis.
“Did the man run away, Dolt, when we stopped for the drag?”
“Monseigneur, he precipitated himself over the hill-side, head first,
as a person plunges into the river.”
“See to it, Gabelle. Go on!”
The half-dozen who were peering at the chain were still among the
wheels, like sheep; the wheels turned so suddenly that they were lucky
to save their skins and bones; they had very little else to save, or they
might not have been so fortunate.
The burst with which the carriage started out of the village and up
the rise beyond, was soon checked by the steepness of the hill. Gradually,
it subsided to a foot pace, swinging and lumbering upward among the
many sweet scents of a summer night. The postilions, with a thousand
gossamer gnats circling about them in lieu of the Furies, quietly mended
the points to the lashes of their whips; the valet walked by the horses;
the courier was audible, trotting on ahead into the dun distance.
At the steepest point of the hill there was a little burial-ground, with
101
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
a Cross and a new large figure of Our Saviour on it; it was a poor figure
in wood, done by some inexperienced rustic carver, but he had studied
the figure from the life—his own life, maybe—for it was dreadfully spare
and thin.
To this distressful emblem of a great distress that had long been
growing worse, and was not at its worst, a woman was kneeling. She
turned her head as the carriage came up to her, rose quickly, and presented herself at the carriage-door.
“It is you, Monseigneur! Monseigneur, a petition.”
With an exclamation of impatience, but with his unchangeable face,
Monseigneur looked out.
“How, then! What is it? Always petitions!”
“Monseigneur. For the love of the great God! My husband, the
forester.”
“What of your husband, the forester? Always the same with you
people. He cannot pay something?”
“He has paid all, Monseigneur. He is dead.”
“Well! He is quiet. Can I restore him to you?”
“Alas, no, Monseigneur! But he lies yonder, under a little heap of
poor grass.”
“Well?”
“Monseigneur, there are so many little heaps of poor grass?”
“Again, well?”
She looked an old woman, but was young. Her manner was one
of passionate grief; by turns she clasped her veinous and knotted hands
together with wild energy, and laid one of them on the carriage-door—
tenderly, caressingly, as if it had been a human breast, and could be
expected to feel the appealing touch.
“Monseigneur, hear me! Monseigneur, hear my petition! My husband died of want; so many die of want; so many more will die of
want.”
“Again, well? Can I feed them?”
“Monseigneur, the good God knows; but I don’t ask it. My petition
is, that a morsel of stone or wood, with my husband’s name, may be
placed over him to show where he lies. Otherwise, the place will be
quickly forgotten, it will never be found when I am dead of the same
malady, I shall be laid under some other heap of poor grass. Monseigneur, they are so many, they increase so fast, there is so much want.
Monseigneur! Monseigneur!”
102
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
The valet had put her away from the door, the carriage had broken
into a brisk trot, the postilions had quickened the pace, she was left
far behind, and Monseigneur, again escorted by the Furies, was rapidly
diminishing the league or two of distance that remained between him
and his chateau.
The sweet scents of the summer night rose all around him, and rose,
as the rain falls, impartially, on the dusty, ragged, and toil-worn group
at the fountain not far away; to whom the mender of roads, with the
aid of the blue cap without which he was nothing, still enlarged upon
his man like a spectre, as long as they could bear it. By degrees, as they
could bear no more, they dropped off one by one, and lights twinkled
in little casements; which lights, as the casements darkened, and more
stars came out, seemed to have shot up into the sky instead of having
been extinguished.
The shadow of a large high-roofed house, and of many over-hanging
trees, was upon Monsieur the Marquis by that time; and the shadow
was exchanged for the light of a flambeau, as his carriage stopped, and
the great door of his chateau was opened to him.
“Monsieur Charles, whom I expect; is he arrived from England?”
“Monseigneur, not yet.”
Chapter 9
The Gorgon’s Head
It was a heavy mass of building, that chateau of Monsieur the Marquis,
with a large stone courtyard before it, and two stone sweeps of staircase
meeting in a stone terrace before the principal door. A stony business
altogether, with heavy stone balustrades, and stone urns, and stone flowers, and stone faces of men, and stone heads of lions, in all directions.
As if the Gorgon’s head had surveyed it, when it was finished, two centuries ago.
Up the broad flight of shallow steps, Monsieur the Marquis, flambeau preceded, went from his carriage, sufficiently disturbing the darkness to elicit loud remonstrance from an owl in the roof of the great pile
of stable building away among the trees. All else was so quiet, that the
flambeau carried up the steps, and the other flambeau held at the great
door, burnt as if they were in a close room of state, instead of being in
103
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
the open night-air. Other sound than the owl’s voice there was none,
save the failing of a fountain into its stone basin; for, it was one of those
dark nights that hold their breath by the hour together, and then heave
a long low sigh, and hold their breath again.
The great door clanged behind him, and Monsieur the Marquis
crossed a hall grim with certain old boar-spears, swords, and knives
of the chase; grimmer with certain heavy riding-rods and riding-whips,
of which many a peasant, gone to his benefactor Death, had felt the
weight when his lord was angry.
Avoiding the larger rooms, which were dark and made fast for the
night, Monsieur the Marquis, with his flambeau-bearer going on before,
went up the staircase to a door in a corridor. This thrown open, admitted him to his own private apartment of three rooms: his bed-chamber
and two others. High vaulted rooms with cool uncarpeted floors, great
dogs upon the hearths for the burning of wood in winter time, and all
luxuries befitting the state of a marquis in a luxurious age and country. The fashion of the last Louis but one, of the line that was never to
break—the fourteenth Louis—was conspicuous in their rich furniture;
but, it was diversified by many objects that were illustrations of old
pages in the history of France.
A supper-table was laid for two, in the third of the rooms; a round
room, in one of the chateau’s four extinguisher-topped towers. A small
lofty room, with its window wide open, and the wooden jalousie-blinds
closed, so that the dark night only showed in slight horizontal lines of
black, alternating with their broad lines of stone colour.
“My nephew,” said the Marquis, glancing at the supper preparation;
“they said he was not arrived.”
Nor was he; but, he had been expected with Monseigneur.
“Ah! It is not probable he will arrive to-night; nevertheless, leave
the table as it is. I shall be ready in a quarter of an hour.”
In a quarter of an hour Monseigneur was ready, and sat down alone
to his sumptuous and choice supper. His chair was opposite to the window, and he had taken his soup, and was raising his glass of Bordeaux
to his lips, when he put it down.
“What is that?” he calmly asked, looking with attention at the horizontal lines of black and stone colour.
“Monseigneur? That?”
“Outside the blinds. Open the blinds.”
It was done.
104
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
“Well?”
“Monseigneur, it is nothing. The trees and the night are all that are
here.”
The servant who spoke, had thrown the blinds wide, had looked out
into the vacant darkness, and stood with that blank behind him, looking
round for instructions.
“Good,” said the imperturbable master. “Close them again.”
That was done too, and the Marquis went on with his supper. He
was half way through it, when he again stopped with his glass in his
hand, hearing the sound of wheels. It came on briskly, and came up to
the front of the chateau.
“Ask who is arrived.”
It was the nephew of Monseigneur. He had been some few leagues
behind Monseigneur, early in the afternoon. He had diminished the
distance rapidly, but not so rapidly as to come up with Monseigneur on
the road. He had heard of Monseigneur, at the posting-houses, as being
before him.
He was to be told (said Monseigneur) that supper awaited him then
and there, and that he was prayed to come to it. In a little while he
came. He had been known in England as Charles Darnay.
Monseigneur received him in a courtly manner, but they did not
shake hands.
“You left Paris yesterday, sir?” he said to Monseigneur, as he took
his seat at table.
“Yesterday. And you?”
“I come direct.”
“From London?”
“Yes.”
“You have been a long time coming,” said the Marquis, with a smile.
“On the contrary; I come direct.”
“Pardon me! I mean, not a long time on the journey; a long time
intending the journey.”
“I have been detained by”—the nephew stopped a moment in his
answer—“various business.”
“Without doubt,” said the polished uncle.
So long as a servant was present, no other words passed between
them. When coffee had been served and they were alone together, the
nephew, looking at the uncle and meeting the eyes of the face that was
like a fine mask, opened a conversation.
105
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
“I have come back, sir, as you anticipate, pursuing the object that
took me away. It carried me into great and unexpected peril; but it is
a sacred object, and if it had carried me to death I hope it would have
sustained me.”
“Not to death,” said the uncle; “it is not necessary to say, to death.”
“I doubt, sir,” returned the nephew, “whether, if it had carried me
to the utmost brink of death, you would have cared to stop me there.”
The deepened marks in the nose, and the lengthening of the fine
straight lines in the cruel face, looked ominous as to that; the uncle
made a graceful gesture of protest, which was so clearly a slight form of
good breeding that it was not reassuring.
“Indeed, sir,” pursued the nephew, “for anything I know, you may
have expressly worked to give a more suspicious appearance to the suspicious circumstances that surrounded me.”
“No, no, no,” said the uncle, pleasantly.
“But, however that may be,” resumed the nephew, glancing at him
with deep distrust, “I know that your diplomacy would stop me by any
means, and would know no scruple as to means.”
“My friend, I told you so,” said the uncle, with a fine pulsation in
the two marks. “Do me the favour to recall that I told you so, long
ago.”
“I recall it.”
“Thank you,” said the Marquise—very sweetly indeed.
His tone lingered in the air, almost like the tone of a musical instrument.
“In effect, sir,” pursued the nephew, “I believe it to be at once your
bad fortune, and my good fortune, that has kept me out of a prison in
France here.”
“I do not quite understand,” returned the uncle, sipping his coffee.
“Dare I ask you to explain?”
“I believe that if you were not in disgrace with the Court, and had
not been overshadowed by that cloud for years past, a letter de cachet
would have sent me to some fortress indefinitely.”
“It is possible,” said the uncle, with great calmness. “For the honour
of the family, I could even resolve to incommode you to that extent.
Pray excuse me!”
“I perceive that, happily for me, the Reception of the day before
yesterday was, as usual, a cold one,” observed the nephew.
“I would not say happily, my friend,” returned the uncle, with re106
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
fined politeness; “I would not be sure of that. A good opportunity
for consideration, surrounded by the advantages of solitude, might influence your destiny to far greater advantage than you influence it for
yourself. But it is useless to discuss the question. I am, as you say, at a
disadvantage. These little instruments of correction, these gentle aids to
the power and honour of families, these slight favours that might so incommode you, are only to be obtained now by interest and importunity.
They are sought by so many, and they are granted (comparatively) to so
few! It used not to be so, but France in all such things is changed for the
worse. Our not remote ancestors held the right of life and death over
the surrounding vulgar. From this room, many such dogs have been
taken out to be hanged; in the next room (my bedroom), one fellow, to
our knowledge, was poniarded on the spot for professing some insolent
delicacy respecting his daughter—his daughter? We have lost many privileges; a new philosophy has become the mode; and the assertion of our
station, in these days, might (I do not go so far as to say would, but
might) cause us real inconvenience. All very bad, very bad!”
The Marquis took a gentle little pinch of snuff, and shook his head;
as elegantly despondent as he could becomingly be of a country still
containing himself, that great means of regeneration.
“We have so asserted our station, both in the old time and in the
modern time also,” said the nephew, gloomily, “that I believe our name
to be more detested than any name in France.”
“Let us hope so,” said the uncle. “Detestation of the high is the
involuntary homage of the low.”
“There is not,” pursued the nephew, in his former tone, “a face I can
look at, in all this country round about us, which looks at me with any
deference on it but the dark deference of fear and slavery.”
“A compliment,” said the Marquis, “to the grandeur of the family,
merited by the manner in which the family has sustained its grandeur.
Hah!” And he took another gentle little pinch of snuff, and lightly
crossed his legs.
But, when his nephew, leaning an elbow on the table, covered his
eyes thoughtfully and dejectedly with his hand, the fine mask looked at
him sideways with a stronger concentration of keenness, closeness, and
dislike, than was comportable with its wearer’s assumption of indifference.
“Repression is the only lasting philosophy. The dark deference of
fear and slavery, my friend,” observed the Marquis, “will keep the dogs
107
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
obedient to the whip, as long as this roof,” looking up to it, “shuts out
the sky.”
That might not be so long as the Marquis supposed. If a picture of
the chateau as it was to be a very few years hence, and of fifty like it as
they too were to be a very few years hence, could have been shown to
him that night, he might have been at a loss to claim his own from the
ghastly, fire-charred, plunder-wrecked rains. As for the roof he vaunted,
he might have found that shutting out the sky in a new way—to wit, for
ever, from the eyes of the bodies into which its lead was fired, out of the
barrels of a hundred thousand muskets.
“Meanwhile,” said the Marquis, “I will preserve the honour and
repose of the family, if you will not. But you must be fatigued. Shall we
terminate our conference for the night?”
“A moment more.”
“An hour, if you please.”
“Sir,” said the nephew, “we have done wrong, and are reaping the
fruits of wrong.”
“We have done wrong?” repeated the Marquis, with an inquiring
smile, and delicately pointing, first to his nephew, then to himself.
“Our family; our honourable family, whose honour is of so much
account to both of us, in such different ways. Even in my father’s time,
we did a world of wrong, injuring every human creature who came
between us and our pleasure, whatever it was. Why need I speak of
my father’s time, when it is equally yours? Can I separate my father’s
twin-brother, joint inheritor, and next successor, from himself?”
“Death has done that!” said the Marquis.
“And has left me,” answered the nephew, “bound to a system that is
frightful to me, responsible for it, but powerless in it; seeking to execute
the last request of my dear mother’s lips, and obey the last look of my
dear mother’s eyes, which implored me to have mercy and to redress;
and tortured by seeking assistance and power in vain.”
“Seeking them from me, my nephew,” said the Marquis, touching
him on the breast with his forefinger—they were now standing by the
hearth—“you will for ever seek them in vain, be assured.”
Every fine straight line in the clear whiteness of his face, was cruelly,
craftily, and closely compressed, while he stood looking quietly at his
nephew, with his snuff-box in his hand. Once again he touched him
on the breast, as though his finger were the fine point of a small sword,
with which, in delicate finesse, he ran him through the body, and said,
108
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
“My friend, I will die, perpetuating the system under which I have
lived.”
When he had said it, he took a culminating pinch of snuff, and put
his box in his pocket.
“Better to be a rational creature,” he added then, after ringing a
small bell on the table, “and accept your natural destiny. But you are
lost, Monsieur Charles, I see.”
“This property and France are lost to me,” said the nephew, sadly;
“I renounce them.”
“Are they both yours to renounce? France may be, but is the property? It is scarcely worth mentioning; but, is it yet?”
“I had no intention, in the words I used, to claim it yet. If it passed
to me from you, to-morrow—”
“Which I have the vanity to hope is not probable.”
“—or twenty years hence—”
“You do me too much honour,” said the Marquis; “still, I prefer that
supposition.”
“—I would abandon it, and live otherwise and elsewhere. It is little
to relinquish. What is it but a wilderness of misery and ruin!”
“Hah!” said the Marquis, glancing round the luxurious room.
“To the eye it is fair enough, here; but seen in its integrity, under the
sky, and by the daylight, it is a crumbling tower of waste, mismanagement, extortion, debt, mortgage, oppression, hunger, nakedness, and
suffering.”
“Hah!” said the Marquis again, in a well-satisfied manner.
“If it ever becomes mine, it shall be put into some hands better qualified to free it slowly (if such a thing is possible) from the weight that
drags it down, so that the miserable people who cannot leave it and who
have been long wrung to the last point of endurance, may, in another
generation, suffer less; but it is not for me. There is a curse on it, and
on all this land.”
“And you?” said the uncle. “Forgive my curiosity; do you, under
your new philosophy, graciously intend to live?”
“I must do, to live, what others of my countrymen, even with nobility at their backs, may have to do some day-work.”
“In England, for example?”
“Yes. The family honour, sir, is safe from me in this country. The
family name can suffer from me in no other, for I bear it in no other.”
The ringing of the bell had caused the adjoining bed-chamber to
109
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
be lighted. It now shone brightly, through the door of communication.
The Marquis looked that way, and listened for the retreating step of his
valet.
“England is very attractive to you, seeing how indifferently you have
prospered there,” he observed then, turning his calm face to his nephew
with a smile.
“I have already said, that for my prospering there, I am sensible I
may be indebted to you, sir. For the rest, it is my Refuge.”
“They say, those boastful English, that it is the Refuge of many. You
know a compatriot who has found a Refuge there? A Doctor?”
“Yes.”
“With a daughter?”
“Yes.”
“Yes,” said the Marquis. “You are fatigued. Good night!”
As he bent his head in his most courtly manner, there was a secrecy
in his smiling face, and he conveyed an air of mystery to those words,
which struck the eyes and ears of his nephew forcibly. At the same time,
the thin straight lines of the setting of the eyes, and the thin straight
lips, and the markings in the nose, curved with a sarcasm that looked
handsomely diabolic.
“Yes,” repeated the Marquis. “A Doctor with a daughter. Yes. So
commences the new philosophy! You are fatigued. Good night!”
It would have been of as much avail to interrogate any stone face outside the chateau as to interrogate that face of his. The nephew looked
at him, in vain, in passing on to the door.
“Good night!” said the uncle. “I look to the pleasure of seeing you
again in the morning. Good repose! Light Monsieur my nephew to his
chamber there!—And burn Monsieur my nephew in his bed, if you will,”
he added to himself, before he rang his little bell again, and summoned
his valet to his own bedroom.
The valet come and gone, Monsieur the Marquis walked to and fro
in his loose chamber-robe, to prepare himself gently for sleep, that hot
still night. Rustling about the room, his softly-slippered feet making
no noise on the floor, he moved like a refined tiger:—looked like some
enchanted marquis of the impenitently wicked sort, in story, whose periodical change into tiger form was either just going off, or just coming
on.
He moved from end to end of his voluptuous bedroom, looking
again at the scraps of the day’s journey that came unbidden into his
110
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
mind; the slow toil up the hill at sunset, the setting sun, the descent, the
mill, the prison on the crag, the little village in the hollow, the peasants
at the fountain, and the mender of roads with his blue cap pointing out
the chain under the carriage. That fountain suggested the Paris fountain,
the little bundle lying on the step, the women bending over it, and the
tall man with his arms up, crying, “Dead!”
“I am cool now,” said Monsieur the Marquis, “and may go to bed.”
So, leaving only one light burning on the large hearth, he let his thin
gauze curtains fall around him, and heard the night break its silence
with a long sigh as he composed himself to sleep.
The stone faces on the outer walls stared blindly at the black night
for three heavy hours; for three heavy hours, the horses in the stables
rattled at their racks, the dogs barked, and the owl made a noise with
very little resemblance in it to the noise conventionally assigned to the
owl by men-poets. But it is the obstinate custom of such creatures hardly
ever to say what is set down for them.
For three heavy hours, the stone faces of the chateau, lion and human, stared blindly at the night. Dead darkness lay on all the landscape,
dead darkness added its own hush to the hushing dust on all the roads.
The burial-place had got to the pass that its little heaps of poor grass
were undistinguishable from one another; the figure on the Cross might
have come down, for anything that could be seen of it. In the village,
taxers and taxed were fast asleep. Dreaming, perhaps, of banquets, as
the starved usually do, and of ease and rest, as the driven slave and the
yoked ox may, its lean inhabitants slept soundly, and were fed and freed.
The fountain in the village flowed unseen and unheard, and the fountain at the chateau dropped unseen and unheard—both melting away,
like the minutes that were falling from the spring of Time—through
three dark hours. Then, the grey water of both began to be ghostly in
the light, and the eyes of the stone faces of the chateau were opened.
Lighter and lighter, until at last the sun touched the tops of the still
trees, and poured its radiance over the hill. In the glow, the water of
the chateau fountain seemed to turn to blood, and the stone faces crimsoned. The carol of the birds was loud and high, and, on the weatherbeaten sill of the great window of the bed-chamber of Monsieur the
Marquis, one little bird sang its sweetest song with all its might. At this,
the nearest stone face seemed to stare amazed, and, with open mouth
and dropped under-jaw, looked awe-stricken.
Now, the sun was full up, and movement began in the village. Case111
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
ment windows opened, crazy doors were unbarred, and people came
forth shivering—chilled, as yet, by the new sweet air. Then began the
rarely lightened toil of the day among the village population. Some, to
the fountain; some, to the fields; men and women here, to dig and delve;
men and women there, to see to the poor live stock, and lead the bony
cows out, to such pasture as could be found by the roadside. In the
church and at the Cross, a kneeling figure or two; attendant on the latter prayers, the led cow, trying for a breakfast among the weeds at its
foot.
The chateau awoke later, as became its quality, but awoke gradually
and surely. First, the lonely boar-spears and knives of the chase had
been reddened as of old; then, had gleamed trenchant in the morning
sunshine; now, doors and windows were thrown open, horses in their
stables looked round over their shoulders at the light and freshness pouring in at doorways, leaves sparkled and rustled at iron-grated windows,
dogs pulled hard at their chains, and reared impatient to be loosed.
All these trivial incidents belonged to the routine of life, and the
return of morning. Surely, not so the ringing of the great bell of the
chateau, nor the running up and down the stairs; nor the hurried figures on the terrace; nor the booting and tramping here and there and
everywhere, nor the quick saddling of horses and riding away?
What winds conveyed this hurry to the grizzled mender of roads,
already at work on the hill-top beyond the village, with his day’s dinner
(not much to carry) lying in a bundle that it was worth no crow’s while
to peck at, on a heap of stones? Had the birds, carrying some grains
of it to a distance, dropped one over him as they sow chance seeds?
Whether or no, the mender of roads ran, on the sultry morning, as if for
his life, down the hill, knee-high in dust, and never stopped till he got
to the fountain.
All the people of the village were at the fountain, standing about in
their depressed manner, and whispering low, but showing no other emotions than grim curiosity and surprise. The led cows, hastily brought in
and tethered to anything that would hold them, were looking stupidly
on, or lying down chewing the cud of nothing particularly repaying their
trouble, which they had picked up in their interrupted saunter. Some of
the people of the chateau, and some of those of the posting-house, and
all the taxing authorities, were armed more or less, and were crowded
on the other side of the little street in a purposeless way, that was highly
fraught with nothing. Already, the mender of roads had penetrated into
112
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
the midst of a group of fifty particular friends, and was smiting himself
in the breast with his blue cap. What did all this portend, and what portended the swift hoisting-up of Monsieur Gabelle behind a servant on
horseback, and the conveying away of the said Gabelle (double-laden
though the horse was), at a gallop, like a new version of the German
ballad of Leonora?
It portended that there was one stone face too many, up at the
chateau.
The Gorgon had surveyed the building again in the night, and had
added the one stone face wanting; the stone face for which it had waited
through about two hundred years.
It lay back on the pillow of Monsieur the Marquis. It was like a fine
mask, suddenly startled, made angry, and petrified. Driven home into
the heart of the stone figure attached to it, was a knife. Round its hilt
was a frill of paper, on which was scrawled:
“Drive him fast to his tomb. This, from Jacques.”
Chapter 10
Two Promises
More months, to the number of twelve, had come and gone, and Mr.
Charles Darnay was established in England as a higher teacher of the
French language who was conversant with French literature. In this age,
he would have been a Professor; in that age, he was a Tutor. He read
with young men who could find any leisure and interest for the study
of a living tongue spoken all over the world, and he cultivated a taste
for its stores of knowledge and fancy. He could write of them, besides,
in sound English, and render them into sound English. Such masters
were not at that time easily found; Princes that had been, and Kings that
were to be, were not yet of the Teacher class, and no ruined nobility had
dropped out of Tellson’s ledgers, to turn cooks and carpenters. As a tutor, whose attainments made the student’s way unusually pleasant and
profitable, and as an elegant translator who brought something to his
work besides mere dictionary knowledge, young Mr. Darnay soon became known and encouraged. He was well acquainted, more-over, with
the circumstances of his country, and those were of ever-growing interest. So, with great perseverance and untiring industry, he prospered.
113
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
In London, he had expected neither to walk on pavements of gold,
nor to lie on beds of roses; if he had had any such exalted expectation,
he would not have prospered. He had expected labour, and he found it,
and did it and made the best of it. In this, his prosperity consisted.
A certain portion of his time was passed at Cambridge, where he
read with undergraduates as a sort of tolerated smuggler who drove a
contraband trade in European languages, instead of conveying Greek
and Latin through the Custom-house. The rest of his time he passed in
London.
Now, from the days when it was always summer in Eden, to these
days when it is mostly winter in fallen latitudes, the world of a man has
invariably gone one way—Charles Darnay’s way—the way of the love
of a woman.
He had loved Lucie Manette from the hour of his danger. He had
never heard a sound so sweet and dear as the sound of her compassionate voice; he had never seen a face so tenderly beautiful, as hers when
it was confronted with his own on the edge of the grave that had been
dug for him. But, he had not yet spoken to her on the subject; the assassination at the deserted chateau far away beyond the heaving water and
the long, tong, dusty roads—the solid stone chateau which had itself
become the mere mist of a dream—had been done a year, and he had
never yet, by so much as a single spoken word, disclosed to her the state
of his heart.
That he had his reasons for this, he knew full well. It was again a
summer day when, lately arrived in London from his college occupation,
he turned into the quiet corner in Soho, bent on seeking an opportunity
of opening his mind to Doctor Manette. It was the close of the summer
day, and he knew Lucie to be out with Miss Pross.
He found the Doctor reading in his arm-chair at a window. The
energy which had at once supported him under his old sufferings and
aggravated their sharpness, had been gradually restored to him. He
was now a very energetic man indeed, with great firmness of purpose,
strength of resolution, and vigour of action. In his recovered energy
he was sometimes a little fitful and sudden, as he had at first been in
the exercise of his other recovered faculties; but, this had never been
frequently observable, and had grown more and more rare.
He studied much, slept little, sustained a great deal of fatigue with
ease, and was equably cheerful. To him, now entered Charles Darnay,
at sight of whom he laid aside his book and held out his hand.
114
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
“Charles Darnay! I rejoice to see you. We have been counting on
your return these three or four days past. Mr. Stryver and Sydney Carton were both here yesterday, and both made you out to be more than
due.”
“I am obliged to them for their interest in the matter,” he answered,
a little coldly as to them, though very warmly as to the Doctor. “Miss
Manette—”
“Is well,” said the Doctor, as he stopped short, “and your return
will delight us all. She has gone out on some household matters, but
will soon be home.”
“Doctor Manette, I knew she was from home. I took the opportunity of her being from home, to beg to speak to you.”
There was a blank silence.
“Yes?” said the Doctor, with evident constraint. “Bring your chair
here, and speak on.”
He complied as to the chair, but appeared to find the speaking on
less easy.
“I have had the happiness, Doctor Manette, of being so intimate
here,” so he at length began, “for some year and a half, that I hope the
topic on which I am about to touch may not—”
He was stayed by the Doctor’s putting out his hand to stop him.
When he had kept it so a little while, he said, drawing it back:
“Is Lucie the topic?”
“She is.”
“It is hard for me to speak of her at any time. It is very hard for me
to hear her spoken of in that tone of yours, Charles Darnay.”
“It is a tone of fervent admiration, true homage, and deep love, Doctor Manette!” he said deferentially.
There was another blank silence before her father rejoined:
“I believe it. I do you justice; I believe it.”
His constraint was so manifest, and it was so manifest, too, that
it originated in an unwillingness to approach the subject, that Charles
Darnay hesitated.
“Shall I go on, sir?”
Another blank.
“Yes, go on.”
“You anticipate what I would say, though you cannot know how
earnestly I say it, how earnestly I feel it, without knowing my secret
heart, and the hopes and fears and anxieties with which it has long
115
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
been laden. Dear Doctor Manette, I love your daughter fondly, dearly,
disinterestedly, devotedly. If ever there were love in the world, I love her.
You have loved yourself; let your old love speak for me!”
The Doctor sat with his face turned away, and his eyes bent on the
ground. At the last words, he stretched out his hand again, hurriedly,
and cried:
“Not that, sir! Let that be! I adjure you, do not recall that!”
His cry was so like a cry of actual pain, that it rang in Charles Darnay’s ears long after he had ceased. He motioned with the hand he had
extended, and it seemed to be an appeal to Darnay to pause. The latter
so received it, and remained silent.
“I ask your pardon,” said the Doctor, in a subdued tone, after some
moments. “I do not doubt your loving Lucie; you may be satisfied of
it.”
He turned towards him in his chair, but did not look at him, or
raise his eyes. His chin dropped upon his hand, and his white hair
overshadowed his face:
“Have you spoken to Lucie?”
“No.”
“Nor written?”
“Never.”
“It would be ungenerous to affect not to know that your self-denial
is to be referred to your consideration for her father. Her father thanks
you.
He offered his hand; but his eyes did not go with it.
“I know,” said Darnay, respectfully, “how can I fail to know, Doctor
Manette, I who have seen you together from day to day, that between
you and Miss Manette there is an affection so unusual, so touching,
so belonging to the circumstances in which it has been nurtured, that
it can have few parallels, even in the tenderness between a father and
child. I know, Doctor Manette—how can I fail to know—that, mingled
with the affection and duty of a daughter who has become a woman,
there is, in her heart, towards you, all the love and reliance of infancy
itself. I know that, as in her childhood she had no parent, so she is
now devoted to you with all the constancy and fervour of her present
years and character, united to the trustfulness and attachment of the
early days in which you were lost to her. I know perfectly well that if
you had been restored to her from the world beyond this life, you could
hardly be invested, in her sight, with a more sacred character than that
116
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
in which you are always with her. I know that when she is clinging to
you, the hands of baby, girl, and woman, all in one, are round your
neck. I know that in loving you she sees and loves her mother at her
own age, sees and loves you at my age, loves her mother broken-hearted,
loves you through your dreadful trial and in your blessed restoration. I
have known this, night and day, since I have known you in your home.”
Her father sat silent, with his face bent down. His breathing was a
little quickened; but he repressed all other signs of agitation.
“Dear Doctor Manette, always knowing this, always seeing her and
you with this hallowed light about you, I have forborne, and forborne,
as long as it was in the nature of man to do it. I have felt, and do even
now feel, that to bring my love—even mine—between you, is to touch
your history with something not quite so good as itself. But I love her.
Heaven is my witness that I love her!”
“I believe it,” answered her father, mournfully. “I have thought so
before now. I believe it.”
“But, do not believe,” said Darnay, upon whose ear the mournful
voice struck with a reproachful sound, “that if my fortune were so cast
as that, being one day so happy as to make her my wife, I must at any
time put any separation between her and you, I could or would breathe
a word of what I now say. Besides that I should know it to be hopeless,
I should know it to be a baseness. If I had any such possibility, even at a
remote distance of years, harboured in my thoughts, and hidden in my
heart—if it ever had been there—if it ever could be there—I could not
now touch this honoured hand.”
He laid his own upon it as he spoke.
“No, dear Doctor Manette. Like you, a voluntary exile from France;
like you, driven from it by its distractions, oppressions, and miseries;
like you, striving to live away from it by my own exertions, and trusting
in a happier future; I look only to sharing your fortunes, sharing your
life and home, and being faithful to you to the death. Not to divide with
Lucie her privilege as your child, companion, and friend; but to come in
aid of it, and bind her closer to you, if such a thing can be.”
His touch still lingered on her father’s hand. Answering the touch
for a moment, but not coldly, her father rested his hands upon the arms
of his chair, and looked up for the first time since the beginning of the
conference. A struggle was evidently in his face; a struggle with that
occasional look which had a tendency in it to dark doubt and dread.
“You speak so feelingly and so manfully, Charles Darnay, that I
117
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
thank you with all my heart, and will open all my heart—or nearly
so. Have you any reason to believe that Lucie loves you?”
“None. As yet, none.”
“Is it the immediate object of this confidence, that you may at once
ascertain that, with my knowledge?”
“Not even so. I might not have the hopefulness to do it for weeks; I
might (mistaken or not mistaken) have that hopefulness to-morrow.”
“Do you seek any guidance from me?”
“I ask none, sir. But I have thought it possible that you might have
it in your power, if you should deem it right, to give me some.”
“Do you seek any promise from me?”
“I do seek that.”
“What is it?”
“I well understand that, without you, I could have no hope. I well
understand that, even if Miss Manette held me at this moment in her
innocent heart-do not think I have the presumption to assume so much—
I could retain no place in it against her love for her father.”
“If that be so, do you see what, on the other hand, is involved in it?”
“I understand equally well, that a word from her father in any
suitor’s favour, would outweigh herself and all the world. For which
reason, Doctor Manette,” said Darnay, modestly but firmly, “I would
not ask that word, to save my life.”
“I am sure of it. Charles Darnay, mysteries arise out of close love,
as well as out of wide division; in the former case, they are subtle and
delicate, and difficult to penetrate. My daughter Lucie is, in this one
respect, such a mystery to me; I can make no guess at the state of her
heart.”
“May I ask, sir, if you think she is—” As he hesitated, her father
supplied the rest.
“Is sought by any other suitor?”
“It is what I meant to say.”
Her father considered a little before he answered:
“You have seen Mr. Carton here, yourself. Mr. Stryver is here too,
occasionally. If it be at all, it can only be by one of these.”
“Or both,” said Darnay.
“I had not thought of both; I should not think either, likely. You
want a promise from me. Tell me what it is.”
“It is, that if Miss Manette should bring to you at any time, on her
own part, such a confidence as I have ventured to lay before you, you
118
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
will bear testimony to what I have said, and to your belief in it. I hope
you may be able to think so well of me, as to urge no influence against
me. I say nothing more of my stake in this; this is what I ask. The
condition on which I ask it, and which you have an undoubted right to
require, I will observe immediately.”
“I give the promise,” said the Doctor, “without any condition. I
believe your object to be, purely and truthfully, as you have stated it.
I believe your intention is to perpetuate, and not to weaken, the ties
between me and my other and far dearer self. If she should ever tell me
that you are essential to her perfect happiness, I will give her to you. If
there were—Charles Darnay, if there were—”
The young man had taken his hand gratefully; their hands were
joined as the Doctor spoke:
“—any fancies, any reasons, any apprehensions, anything whatsoever, new or old, against the man she really loved—the direct responsibility thereof not lying on his head—they should all be obliterated for
her sake. She is everything to me; more to me than suffering, more to
me than wrong, more to me—Well! This is idle talk.”
So strange was the way in which he faded into silence, and so strange
his fixed look when he had ceased to speak, that Darnay felt his own
hand turn cold in the hand that slowly released and dropped it.
“You said something to me,” said Doctor Manette, breaking into a
smile. “What was it you said to me?”
He was at a loss how to answer, until he remembered having spoken
of a condition. Relieved as his mind reverted to that, he answered:
“Your confidence in me ought to be returned with full confidence
on my part. My present name, though but slightly changed from my
mother’s, is not, as you will remember, my own. I wish to tell you what
that is, and why I am in England.”
“Stop!” said the Doctor of Beauvais.
“I wish it, that I may the better deserve your confidence, and have
no secret from you.”
“Stop!”
For an instant, the Doctor even had his two hands at his ears; for
another instant, even had his two hands laid on Darnay’s lips.
“Tell me when I ask you, not now. If your suit should prosper, if
Lucie should love you, you shall tell me on your marriage morning. Do
you promise?”
“Willingly.
119
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
“Give me your hand. She will be home directly, and it is better she
should not see us together to-night. Go! God bless you!”
It was dark when Charles Darnay left him, and it was an hour later
and darker when Lucie came home; she hurried into the room alone—
for Miss Pross had gone straight up-stairs—and was surprised to find
his reading-chair empty.
“My father!” she called to him. “Father dear!”
Nothing was said in answer, but she heard a low hammering sound
in his bedroom. Passing lightly across the intermediate room, she looked
in at his door and came running back frightened, crying to herself, with
her blood all chilled, “What shall I do! What shall I do!”
Her uncertainty lasted but a moment; she hurried back, and tapped
at his door, and softly called to him. The noise ceased at the sound of
her voice, and he presently came out to her, and they walked up and
down together for a long time.
She came down from her bed, to look at him in his sleep that night.
He slept heavily, and his tray of shoemaking tools, and his old unfinished work, were all as usual.

A Companion Picture
“Sydney,” said Mr. Stryver, on that self-same night, or morning, to his
jackal; “mix another bowl of punch; I have something to say to you.”
Sydney had been working double tides that night, and the night before, and the night before that, and a good many nights in succession,
making a grand clearance among Mr. Stryver’s papers before the setting
in of the long vacation. The clearance was effected at last; the Stryver
arrears were handsomely fetched up; everything was got rid of until
November should come with its fogs atmospheric, and fogs legal, and
bring grist to the mill again.
Sydney was none the livelier and none the soberer for so much application. It had taken a deal of extra wet-towelling to pull him through
the night; a correspondingly extra quantity of wine had preceded the
towelling; and he was in a very damaged condition, as he now pulled
his turban off and threw it into the basin in which he had steeped it at
intervals for the last six hours.
120
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
“Are you mixing that other bowl of punch?” said Stryver the portly,
with his hands in his waistband, glancing round from the sofa where he
lay on his back.
“I am.”
“Now, look here! I am going to tell you something that will rather
surprise you, and that perhaps will make you think me not quite as
shrewd as you usually do think me. I intend to marry.”
“Do you?”
“Yes. And not for money. What do you say now?”
“I don’t feel disposed to say much. Who is she?”
“Guess.”
“Do I know her?”
“Guess.”
“I am not going to guess, at five o’clock in the morning, with my
brains frying and sputtering in my head. if you want me to guess, you
must ask me to dinner.”
“Well then, I’ll tell you,” said Stryver, coming slowly into a sitting
posture. “Sydney, I rather despair of making myself intelligible to you,
because you are such an insensible dog.”
“And you,” returned Sydney, busy concocting the punch, “are such
a sensitive and poetical spirit—”
“Come!” rejoined Stryver, laughing boastfully, “though I don’t prefer any claim to being the soul of Romance (for I hope I know better),
still I am a tenderer sort of fellow than you.”
“You are a luckier, if you mean that.”
“I don’t mean that. I mean I am a man of more—more—”
“Say gallantry, while you are about it,” suggested Carton.
“Well! I’ll say gallantry. My meaning is that I am a man,” said
Stryver, inflating himself at his friend as he made the punch, “who cares
more to be agreeable, who takes more pains to be agreeable, who knows
better how to be agreeable, in a woman’s society, than you do.”
“Go on,” said Sydney Carton.
“No; but before I go on,” said Stryver, shaking his head in his bullying way, I’ll have this out with you. You’ve been at Doctor Manette’s
house as much as I have, or more than I have. Why, I have been
ashamed of your moroseness there! Your manners have been of that
silent and sullen and hangdog kind, that, upon my life and soul, I have
been ashamed of you, Sydney¡‘
“It should be very beneficial to a man in your practice at the bar,
121
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
to be ashamed of anything,” returned Sydney; “you ought to be much
obliged to me.”
“You shall not get off in that way,” rejoined Stryver, shouldering the
rejoinder at him; “no, Sydney, it’s my duty to tell you—and I tell you to
your face to do you good—that you are a devilish ill-conditioned fellow
in that sort of society. You are a disagreeable fellow.”
Sydney drank a bumper of the punch he had made, and laughed.
“Look at me!” said Stryver, squaring himself; “I have less need
to make myself agreeable than you have, being more independent in
circumstances. Why do I do it?”
“I never saw you do it yet,” muttered Carton.
“I do it because it’s politic; I do it on principle. And look at me! I
get on.”
“You don’t get on with your account of your matrimonial intentions,” answered Carton, with a careless air; “I wish you would keep to
that. As to me—will you never understand that I am incorrigible?”
He asked the question with some appearance of scorn.
“You have no business to be incorrigible,” was his friend’s answer,
delivered in no very soothing tone.
“I have no business to be, at all, that I know of,” said Sydney Carton.
“Who is the lady?”
“Now, don’t let my announcement of the name make you uncomfortable, Sydney,” said Mr. Stryver, preparing him with ostentatious
friendliness for the disclosure he was about to make, “because I know
you don’t mean half you say; and if you meant it all, it would be of no
importance. I make this little preface, because you once mentioned the
young lady to me in slighting terms.”
“I did?”
“Certainly; and in these chambers.”
Sydney Carton looked at his punch and looked at his complacent
friend; drank his punch and looked at his complacent friend.
“You made mention of the young lady as a golden-haired doll. The
young lady is Miss Manette. If you had been a fellow of any sensitiveness or delicacy of feeling in that kind of way, Sydney, I might have been
a little resentful of your employing such a designation; but you are not.
You want that sense altogether; therefore I am no more annoyed when
I think of the expression, than I should be annoyed by a man’s opinion
of a picture of mine, who had no eye for pictures: or of a piece of music
of mine, who had no ear for music.”
122
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
Sydney Carton drank the punch at a great rate; drank it by bumpers,
looking at his friend.
“Now you know all about it, Syd,” said Mr. Stryver. “I don’t care
about fortune: she is a charming creature, and I have made up my mind
to please myself: on the whole, I think I can afford to please myself. She
will have in me a man already pretty well off, and a rapidly rising man,
and a man of some distinction: it is a piece of good fortune for her, but
she is worthy of good fortune. Are you astonished?”
Carton, still drinking the punch, rejoined, “Why should I be astonished?”
“You approve?”
Carton, still drinking the punch, rejoined, “Why should I not approve?”
“Well!” said his friend Stryver, “you take it more easily than I fancied you would, and are less mercenary on my behalf than I thought
you would be; though, to be sure, you know well enough by this time
that your ancient chum is a man of a pretty strong will. Yes, Sydney, I
have had enough of this style of life, with no other as a change from it;
I feel that it is a pleasant thing for a man to have a home when he feels
inclined to go to it (when he doesn’t, he can stay away), and I feel that
Miss Manette will tell well in any station, and will always do me credit.
So I have made up my mind. And now, Sydney, old boy, I want to say
a word to you about your prospects. You are in a bad way, you know;
you really are in a bad way. You don’t know the value of money, you
live hard, you’ll knock up one of these days, and be ill and poor; you
really ought to think about a nurse.”
The prosperous patronage with which he said it, made him look
twice as big as he was, and four times as offensive.
“Now, let me recommend you,” pursued Stryver, “to look it in the
face. I have looked it in the face, in my different way; look it in the
face, you, in your different way. Marry. Provide somebody to take care
of you. Never mind your having no enjoyment of women’s society, nor
understanding of it, nor tact for it. Find out somebody. Find out some
respectable woman with a little property—somebody in the landlady
way, or lodging-letting way—and marry her, against a rainy day. That’s
the kind of thing for you. Now think of it, Sydney.”
“I’ll think of it,” said Sydney.
123

Chapter 12
The Fellow of Delicacy
Mr. Stryver having made up his mind to that magnanimous bestowal of
good fortune on the Doctor’s daughter, resolved to make her happiness
known to her before he left town for the Long Vacation. After some
mental debating of the point, he came to the conclusion that it would
be as well to get all the preliminaries done with, and they could then arrange at their leisure whether he should give her his hand a week or two
before Michaelmas Term, or in the little Christmas vacation between it
and Hilary.
As to the strength of his case, he had not a doubt about it, but
clearly saw his way to the verdict. Argued with the jury on substantial
worldly grounds—the only grounds ever worth taking into account—it
was a plain case, and had not a weak spot in it. He called himself for
the plaintiff, there was no getting over his evidence, the counsel for the
defendant threw up his brief, and the jury did not even turn to consider.
After trying it, Stryver, C. J., was satisfied that no plainer case could be.
Accordingly, Mr. Stryver inaugurated the Long Vacation with a formal proposal to take Miss Manette to Vauxhall Gardens; that failing,
to Ranelagh; that unaccountably failing too, it behoved him to present
himself in Soho, and there declare his noble mind.
Towards Soho, therefore, Mr. Stryver shouldered his way from the
Temple, while the bloom of the Long Vacation’s infancy was still upon
it. Anybody who had seen him projecting himself into Soho while he
was yet on Saint Dunstan’s side of Temple Bar, bursting in his full-blown
way along the pavement, to the jostlement of all weaker people, might
have seen how safe and strong he was.
His way taking him past Tellson’s, and he both banking at Tellson’s
and knowing Mr. Lorry as the intimate friend of the Manettes, it entered
Mr. Stryver’s mind to enter the bank, and reveal to Mr. Lorry the brightness of the Soho horizon. So, he pushed open the door with the weak
rattle in its throat, stumbled down the two steps, got past the two ancient cashiers, and shouldered himself into the musty back closet where
Mr. Lorry sat at great books ruled for figures, with perpendicular iron
bars to his window as if that were ruled for figures too, and everything
under the clouds were a sum.
“Halloa!” said Mr. Stryver. “How do you do? I hope you are well!”
124
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
It was Stryver’s grand peculiarity that he always seemed too big for
any place, or space. He was so much too big for Tellson’s, that old clerks
in distant corners looked up with looks of remonstrance, as though he
squeezed them against the wall. The House itself, magnificently reading
the paper quite in the far-off perspective, lowered displeased, as if the
Stryver head had been butted into its responsible waistcoat.
The discreet Mr. Lorry said, in a sample tone of the voice he would
recommend under the circumstances, “How do you do, Mr. Stryver?
How do you do, sir?” and shook hands. There was a peculiarity in
his manner of shaking hands, always to be seen in any clerk at Tellson’s
who shook hands with a customer when the House pervaded the air. He
shook in a self-abnegating way, as one who shook for Tellson and Co.
“Can I do anything for you, Mr. Stryver?” asked Mr. Lorry, in his
business character.
“Why, no, thank you; this is a private visit to yourself, Mr. Lorry; I
have come for a private word.”
“Oh indeed!” said Mr. Lorry, bending down his ear, while his eye
strayed to the House afar off.
“I am going,” said Mr. Stryver, leaning his arms confidentially on the
desk: whereupon, although it was a large double one, there appeared to
be not half desk enough for him: “I am going to make an offer of myself
in marriage to your agreeable little friend, Miss Manette, Mr. Lorry.”
“Oh dear me!” cried Mr. Lorry, rubbing his chin, and looking at his
visitor dubiously.
“Oh dear me, sir?” repeated Stryver, drawing back. “Oh dear you,
sir? What may your meaning be, Mr. Lorry?”
“My meaning,” answered the man of business, “is, of course,
friendly and appreciative, and that it does you the greatest credit, and—
in short, my meaning is everything you could desire. But—really, you
know, Mr. Stryver—” Mr. Lorry paused, and shook his head at him
in the oddest manner, as if he were compelled against his will to add,
internally, “you know there really is so much too much of you!”
“Well!” said Stryver, slapping the desk with his contentious hand,
opening his eyes wider, and taking a long breath, “if I understand you,
Mr. Lorry, I’ll be hanged!”
Mr. Lorry adjusted his little wig at both ears as a means towards
that end, and bit the feather of a pen.
“D—n it all, sir!” said Stryver, staring at him, “am I not eligible?”
“Oh dear yes! Yes. Oh yes, you’re eligible!” said Mr. Lorry. “If you
125
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
say eligible, you are eligible.”
“Am I not prosperous?” asked Stryver.
“Oh! if you come to prosperous, you are prosperous,” said Mr.
Lorry.
“And advancing?”
“If you come to advancing you know,” said Mr. Lorry, delighted to
be able to make another admission, “nobody can doubt that.”
“Then what on earth is your meaning, Mr. Lorry?” demanded
Stryver, perceptibly crestfallen.
“Well! I—Were you going there now?” asked Mr. Lorry.
“Straight!” said Stryver, with a plump of his fist on the desk.
“Then I think I wouldn’t, if I was you.”
“Why?” said Stryver. “Now, I’ll put you in a corner,” forensically
shaking a forefinger at him. “You are a man of business and bound to
have a reason. State your reason. Why wouldn’t you go?”
“Because,” said Mr. Lorry, “I wouldn’t go on such an object without
having some cause to believe that I should succeed.”
“D—n me!” cried Stryver, “but this beats everything.”
Mr. Lorry glanced at the distant House, and glanced at the angry
Stryver.
“Here’s a man of business—a man of years—a man of experience—
in a Bank,” said Stryver; “and having summed up three leading reasons
for complete success, he says there’s no reason at all! Says it with his
head on!” Mr. Stryver remarked upon the peculiarity as if it would have
been infinitely less remarkable if he had said it with his head off.
“When I speak of success, I speak of success with the young lady;
and when I speak of causes and reasons to make success probable, I
speak of causes and reasons that will tell as such with the young lady.
The young lady, my good sir,” said Mr. Lorry, mildly tapping the Stryver
arm, “the young lady. The young lady goes before all.”
“Then you mean to tell me, Mr. Lorry,” said Stryver, squaring his
elbows, “that it is your deliberate opinion that the young lady at present
in question is a mincing Fool?”
“Not exactly so. I mean to tell you, Mr. Stryver,” said Mr. Lorry,
reddening, “that I will hear no disrespectful word of that young lady
from any lips; and that if I knew any man—which I hope I do not—
whose taste was so coarse, and whose temper was so overbearing, that
he could not restrain himself from speaking disrespectfully of that young
lady at this desk, not even Tellson’s should prevent my giving him a piece
126
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
of my mind.”
The necessity of being angry in a suppressed tone had put Mr.
Stryver’s blood-vessels into a dangerous state when it was his turn to
be angry; Mr. Lorry’s veins, methodical as their courses could usually
be, were in no better state now it was his turn.
“That is what I mean to tell you, sir,” said Mr. Lorry. “Pray let there
be no mistake about it.”
Mr. Stryver sucked the end of a ruler for a little while, and then
stood hitting a tune out of his teeth with it, which probably gave him
the toothache. He broke the awkward silence by saying:
“This is something new to me, Mr. Lorry. You deliberately advise
me not to go up to Soho and offer myself—myself, Stryver of the King’s
Bench bar?”
“Do you ask me for my advice, Mr. Stryver?”
“Yes, I do.”
“Very good. Then I give it, and you have repeated it correctly.”
“And all I can say of it is,” laughed Stryver with a vexed laugh, “that
this—ha, ha!—beats everything past, present, and to come.”
“Now understand me,” pursued Mr. Lorry. “As a man of business,
I am not justified in saying anything about this matter, for, as a man of
business, I know nothing of it. But, as an old fellow, who has carried
Miss Manette in his arms, who is the trusted friend of Miss Manette
and of her father too, and who has a great affection for them both, I
have spoken. The confidence is not of my seeking, recollect. Now, you
think I may not be right?”
“Not I!” said Stryver, whistling. “I can’t undertake to find third
parties in common sense; I can only find it for myself. I suppose sense in
certain quarters; you suppose mincing bread-and-butter nonsense. It’s
new to me, but you are right, I dare say.”
“What I suppose, Mr. Stryver, I claim to characterise for myself—
And understand me, sir,” said Mr. Lorry, quickly flushing again, “I will
not—not even at Tellson’s—have it characterised for me by any gentleman breathing.”
“There! I beg your pardon!” said Stryver.
“Granted. Thank you. Well, Mr. Stryver, I was about to say:—it
might be painful to you to find yourself mistaken, it might be painful
to Doctor Manette to have the task of being explicit with you, it might
be very painful to Miss Manette to have the task of being explicit with
you. You know the terms upon which I have the honour and happiness
127
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
to stand with the family. If you please, committing you in no way, representing you in no way, I will undertake to correct my advice by the
exercise of a little new observation and judgment expressly brought to
bear upon it. If you should then be dissatisfied with it, you can but test
its soundness for yourself; if, on the other hand, you should be satisfied
with it, and it should be what it now is, it may spare all sides what is
best spared. What do you say?”
“How long would you keep me in town?”
“Oh! It is only a question of a few hours. I could go to Soho in the
evening, and come to your chambers afterwards.”
“Then I say yes,” said Stryver: “I won’t go up there now, I am not
so hot upon it as that comes to; I say yes, and I shall expect you to look
in to-night. Good morning.”
Then Mr. Stryver turned and burst out of the Bank, causing such a
concussion of air on his passage through, that to stand up against it bowing behind the two counters, required the utmost remaining strength of
the two ancient clerks. Those venerable and feeble persons were always
seen by the public in the act of bowing, and were popularly believed,
when they had bowed a customer out, still to keep on bowing in the
empty office until they bowed another customer in.
The barrister was keen enough to divine that the banker would not
have gone so far in his expression of opinion on any less solid ground
than moral certainty. Unprepared as he was for the large pill he had
to swallow, he got it down. “And now,” said Mr. Stryver, shaking his
forensic forefinger at the Temple in general, when it was down, “my
way out of this, is, to put you all in the wrong.”
It was a bit of the art of an Old Bailey tactician, in which he found
great relief. “You shall not put me in the wrong, young lady,” said Mr.
Stryver; “I’ll do that for you.”
Accordingly, when Mr. Lorry called that night as late as ten o’clock,
Mr. Stryver, among a quantity of books and papers littered out for the
purpose, seemed to have nothing less on his mind than the subject of
the morning. He even showed surprise when he saw Mr. Lorry, and was
altogether in an absent and preoccupied state.
“Well!” said that good-natured emissary, after a full half-hour of
bootless attempts to bring him round to the question. “I have been to
Soho.”
“To Soho?” repeated Mr. Stryver, coldly. “Oh, to be sure! What am
I thinking of!”
128
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
“And I have no doubt,” said Mr. Lorry, “that I was right in the conversation we had. My opinion is confirmed, and I reiterate my advice.”
“I assure you,” returned Mr. Stryver, in the friendliest way, “that I
am sorry for it on your account, and sorry for it on the poor father’s
account. I know this must always be a sore subject with the family; let
us say no more about it.”
“I don’t understand you,” said Mr. Lorry.
“I dare say not,” rejoined Stryver, nodding his head in a smoothing
and final way; “no matter, no matter.”
“But it does matter,” Mr. Lorry urged.
“No it doesn’t; I assure you it doesn’t. Having supposed that there
was sense where there is no sense, and a laudable ambition where there
is not a laudable ambition, I am well out of my mistake, and no harm
is done. Young women have committed similar follies often before, and
have repented them in poverty and obscurity often before. In an unselfish aspect, I am sorry that the thing is dropped, because it would
have been a bad thing for me in a worldly point of view; in a selfish aspect, I am glad that the thing has dropped, because it would have been
a bad thing for me in a worldly point of view—it is hardly necessary to
say I could have gained nothing by it. There is no harm at all done. I
have not proposed to the young lady, and, between ourselves, I am by
no means certain, on reflection, that I ever should have committed myself to that extent. Mr. Lorry, you cannot control the mincing vanities
and giddinesses of empty-headed girls; you must not expect to do it, or
you will always be disappointed. Now, pray say no more about it. I
tell you, I regret it on account of others, but I am satisfied on my own
account. And I am really very much obliged to you for allowing me to
sound you, and for giving me your advice; you know the young lady
better than I do; you were right, it never would have done.”
Mr. Lorry was so taken aback, that he looked quite stupidly at Mr.
Stryver shouldering him towards the door, with an appearance of showering generosity, forbearance, and goodwill, on his erring head. “Make
the best of it, my dear sir,” said Stryver; “say no more about it; thank
you again for allowing me to sound you; good night!”
Mr. Lorry was out in the night, before he knew where he was. Mr.
Stryver was lying back on his sofa, winking at his ceiling.

Chapter 13
The Fellow of No Delicacy
If Sydney Carton ever shone anywhere, he certainly never shone in the
house of Doctor Manette. He had been there often, during a whole year,
and had always been the same moody and morose lounger there. When
he cared to talk, he talked well; but, the cloud of caring for nothing,
which overshadowed him with such a fatal darkness, was very rarely
pierced by the light within him.
And yet he did care something for the streets that environed that
house, and for the senseless stones that made their pavements. Many a
night he vaguely and unhappily wandered there, when wine had brought
no transitory gladness to him; many a dreary daybreak revealed his solitary figure lingering there, and still lingering there when the first beams
of the sun brought into strong relief, removed beauties of architecture in
spires of churches and lofty buildings, as perhaps the quiet time brought
some sense of better things, else forgotten and unattainable, into his
mind. Of late, the neglected bed in the Temple Court had known him
more scantily than ever; and often when he had thrown himself upon
it no longer than a few minutes, he had got up again, and haunted that
neighbourhood.
On a day in August, when Mr. Stryver (after notifying to his jackal
that “he had thought better of that marrying matter”) had carried his
delicacy into Devonshire, and when the sight and scent of flowers in the
City streets had some waifs of goodness in them for the worst, of health
for the sickliest, and of youth for the oldest, Sydney’s feet still trod those
stones. From being irresolute and purposeless, his feet became animated
by an intention, and, in the working out of that intention, they took him
to the Doctor’s door.
He was shown up-stairs, and found Lucie at her work, alone. She
had never been quite at her ease with him, and received him with some
little embarrassment as he seated himself near her table. But, looking
up at his face in the interchange of the first few common-places, she
observed a change in it.
“I fear you are not well, Mr. Carton!”
“No. But the life I lead, Miss Manette, is not conducive to health.
What is to be expected of, or by, such profligates?”
130
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
“Is it not—forgive me; I have begun the question on my lips—a pity
to live no better life?”
“God knows it is a shame!”
“Then why not change it?”
Looking gently at him again, she was surprised and saddened to see
that there were tears in his eyes. There were tears in his voice too, as he
answered:
“It is too late for that. I shall never be better than I am. I shall sink
lower, and be worse.”
He leaned an elbow on her table, and covered his eyes with his hand.
The table trembled in the silence that followed.
She had never seen him softened, and was much distressed. He knew
her to be so, without looking at her, and said:
“Pray forgive me, Miss Manette. I break down before the knowledge
of what I want to say to you. Will you hear me?”
“If it will do you any good, Mr. Carton, if it would make you happier,
it would make me very glad!”
“God bless you for your sweet compassion!”
He unshaded his face after a little while, and spoke steadily.
“Don’t be afraid to hear me. Don’t shrink from anything I say. I am
like one who died young. All my life might have been.”
“No, Mr. Carton. I am sure that the best part of it might still be; I
am sure that you might be much, much worthier of yourself.”
“Say of you, Miss Manette, and although I know better—although
in the mystery of my own wretched heart I know better—I shall never
forget it!”
She was pale and trembling. He came to her relief with a fixed
despair of himself which made the interview unlike any other that could
have been holden.
“If it had been possible, Miss Manette, that you could have returned the love of the man you see before yourself—flung away, wasted,
drunken, poor creature of misuse as you know him to be—he would
have been conscious this day and hour, in spite of his happiness, that he
would bring you to misery, bring you to sorrow and repentance, blight
you, disgrace you, pull you down with him. I know very well that you
can have no tenderness for me; I ask for none; I am even thankful that
it cannot be.”
“Without it, can I not save you, Mr. Carton? Can I not recall you—
forgive me again!—to a better course? Can I in no way repay your
131
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
confidence? I know this is a confidence,” she modestly said, after a little
hesitation, and in earnest tears, “I know you would say this to no one
else. Can I turn it to no good account for yourself, Mr. Carton?”
He shook his head.
“To none. No, Miss Manette, to none. If you will hear me through a
very little more, all you can ever do for me is done. I wish you to know
that you have been the last dream of my soul. In my degradation I have
not been so degraded but that the sight of you with your father, and
of this home made such a home by you, has stirred old shadows that I
thought had died out of me. Since I knew you, I have been troubled by a
remorse that I thought would never reproach me again, and have heard
whispers from old voices impelling me upward, that I thought were
silent for ever. I have had unformed ideas of striving afresh, beginning
anew, shaking off sloth and sensuality, and fighting out the abandoned
fight. A dream, all a dream, that ends in nothing, and leaves the sleeper
where he lay down, but I wish you to know that you inspired it.”
“Will nothing of it remain? O Mr. Carton, think again! Try again!”
“No, Miss Manette; all through it, I have known myself to be quite
undeserving. And yet I have had the weakness, and have still the weakness, to wish you to know with what a sudden mastery you kindled
me, heap of ashes that I am, into fire—a fire, however, inseparable in
its nature from myself, quickening nothing, lighting nothing, doing no
service, idly burning away.”
“Since it is my misfortune, Mr. Carton, to have made you more
unhappy than you were before you knew me—”
“Don’t say that, Miss Manette, for you would have reclaimed me, if
anything could. You will not be the cause of my becoming worse.”
“Since the state of your mind that you describe, is, at all events,
attributable to some influence of mine—this is what I mean, if I can
make it plain—can I use no influence to serve you? Have I no power for
good, with you, at all?”
“The utmost good that I am capable of now, Miss Manette, I have
come here to realise. Let me carry through the rest of my misdirected
life, the remembrance that I opened my heart to you, last of all the
world; and that there was something left in me at this time which you
could deplore and pity.”
“Which I entreated you to believe, again and again, most fervently,
with all my heart, was capable of better things, Mr. Carton!”
“Entreat me to believe it no more, Miss Manette. I have proved
132
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
myself, and I know better. I distress you; I draw fast to an end. Will
you let me believe, when I recall this day, that the last confidence of my
life was reposed in your pure and innocent breast, and that it lies there
alone, and will be shared by no one?”
“If that will be a consolation to you, yes.”
“Not even by the dearest one ever to be known to you?”
“Mr. Carton,” she answered, after an agitated pause, “the secret is
yours, not mine; and I promise to respect it.”
“Thank you. And again, God bless you.”
He put her hand to his lips, and moved towards the door.
“Be under no apprehension, Miss Manette, of my ever resuming this
conversation by so much as a passing word. I will never refer to it again.
If I were dead, that could not be surer than it is henceforth. In the hour
of my death, I shall hold sacred the one good remembrance—and shall
thank and bless you for it—that my last avowal of myself was made to
you, and that my name, and faults, and miseries were gently carried in
your heart. May it otherwise be light and happy!”
He was so unlike what he had ever shown himself to be, and it was
so sad to think how much he had thrown away, and how much he every
day kept down and perverted, that Lucie Manette wept mournfully for
him as he stood looking back at her.
“Be comforted!” he said, “I am not worth such feeling, Miss
Manette. An hour or two hence, and the low companions and low
habits that I scorn but yield to, will render me less worth such tears as
those, than any wretch who creeps along the streets. Be comforted! But,
within myself, I shall always be, towards you, what I am now, though
outwardly I shall be what you have heretofore seen me. The last supplication but one I make to you, is, that you will believe this of me.”
“I will, Mr. Carton.”
“My last supplication of all, is this; and with it, I will relieve you
of a visitor with whom I well know you have nothing in unison, and
between whom and you there is an impassable space. It is useless to
say it, I know, but it rises out of my soul. For you, and for any dear
to you, I would do anything. If my career were of that better kind that
there was any opportunity or capacity of sacrifice in it, I would embrace
any sacrifice for you and for those dear to you. Try to hold me in your
mind, at some quiet times, as ardent and sincere in this one thing. The
time will come, the time will not be long in coming, when new ties will
be formed about you—ties that will bind you yet more tenderly and
133
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
strongly to the home you so adorn—the dearest ties that will ever grace
and gladden you. O Miss Manette, when the little picture of a happy
father’s face looks up in yours, when you see your own bright beauty
springing up anew at your feet, think now and then that there is a man
who would give his life, to keep a life you love beside you!”
He said, “Farewell!” said a last “God bless you!” and left her.
Chapter 14
The Honest Tradesman
To the eyes of Mr. Jeremiah Cruncher, sitting on his stool in Fleet-street
with his grisly urchin beside him, a vast number and variety of objects
in movement were every day presented. Who could sit upon anything
in Fleet-street during the busy hours of the day, and not be dazed and
deafened by two immense processions, one ever tending westward with
the sun, the other ever tending eastward from the sun, both ever tending
to the plains beyond the range of red and purple where the sun goes
down!
With his straw in his mouth, Mr. Cruncher sat watching the two
streams, like the heathen rustic who has for several centuries been on
duty watching one stream—saving that Jerry had no expectation of their
ever running dry. Nor would it have been an expectation of a hopeful
kind, since a small part of his income was derived from the pilotage of
timid women (mostly of a full habit and past the middle term of life)
from Tellson’s side of the tides to the opposite shore. Brief as such companionship was in every separate instance, Mr. Cruncher never failed to
become so interested in the lady as to express a strong desire to have
the honour of drinking her very good health. And it was from the gifts
bestowed upon him towards the execution of this benevolent purpose,
that he recruited his finances, as just now observed.
Time was, when a poet sat upon a stool in a public place, and mused
in the sight of men. Mr. Cruncher, sitting on a stool in a public place,
but not being a poet, mused as little as possible, and looked about him.
It fell out that he was thus engaged in a season when crowds were
few, and belated women few, and when his affairs in general were so
unprosperous as to awaken a strong suspicion in his breast that Mrs.
Cruncher must have been “flopping” in some pointed manner, when an
134
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
unusual concourse pouring down Fleet-street westward, attracted his
attention. Looking that way, Mr. Cruncher made out that some kind of
funeral was coming along, and that there was popular objection to this
funeral, which engendered uproar.
“Young Jerry,” said Mr. Cruncher, turning to his offspring, “it’s a
buryin’.”
“Hooroar, father!” cried Young Jerry.
The young gentleman uttered this exultant sound with mysterious
significance. The elder gentleman took the cry so ill, that he watched
his opportunity, and smote the young gentleman on the ear.
“What d’ye mean? What are you hooroaring at? What do you want
to conwey to your own father, you young Rip? This boy is a getting
too many for me!” said Mr. Cruncher, surveying him. “Him and his
hooroars! Don’t let me hear no more of you, or you shall feel some
more of me. D’ye hear?”
“I warn’t doing no harm,” Young Jerry protested, rubbing his cheek.
“Drop it then,” said Mr. Cruncher; “I won’t have none of your no
harms. Get a top of that there seat, and look at the crowd.”
His son obeyed, and the crowd approached; they were bawling
and hissing round a dingy hearse and dingy mourning coach, in which
mourning coach there was only one mourner, dressed in the dingy trappings that were considered essential to the dignity of the position. The
position appeared by no means to please him, however, with an increasing rabble surrounding the coach, deriding him, making grimaces at
him, and incessantly groaning and calling out: “Yah! Spies! Tst! Yaha!
Spies!” with many compliments too numerous and forcible to repeat.
Funerals had at all times a remarkable attraction for Mr. Cruncher;
he always pricked up his senses, and became excited, when a funeral
passed Tellson’s. Naturally, therefore, a funeral with this uncommon
attendance excited him greatly, and he asked of the first man who ran
against him:
“What is it, brother? What’s it about?”
“I don’t know,” said the man. “Spies! Yaha! Tst! Spies!”
He asked another man. “Who is it?”
“I don’t know,” returned the man, clapping his hands to his mouth
nevertheless, and vociferating in a surprising heat and with the greatest
ardour, “Spies! Yaha! Tst, tst! Spi—ies!”
At length, a person better informed on the merits of the case, tumbled against him, and from this person he learned that the funeral was
135
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
the funeral of one Roger Cly.
“Was He a spy?” asked Mr. Cruncher.
“Old Bailey spy,” returned his informant. “Yaha! Tst! Yah! Old
Bailey Spi—i—ies!”
“Why, to be sure!” exclaimed Jerry, recalling the Trial at which he
had assisted. “I’ve seen him. Dead, is he?”
“Dead as mutton,” returned the other, “and can’t be too dead. Have
’em out, there! Spies! Pull ’em out, there! Spies!”
The idea was so acceptable in the prevalent absence of any idea, that
the crowd caught it up with eagerness, and loudly repeating the suggestion to have ’em out, and to pull ’em out, mobbed the two vehicles so
closely that they came to a stop. On the crowd’s opening the coach
doors, the one mourner scuffled out of himself and was in their hands
for a moment; but he was so alert, and made such good use of his time,
that in another moment he was scouring away up a bye-street, after
shedding his cloak, hat, long hatband, white pocket-handkerchief, and
other symbolical tears.
These, the people tore to pieces and scattered far and wide with
great enjoyment, while the tradesmen hurriedly shut up their shops; for
a crowd in those times stopped at nothing, and was a monster much
dreaded. They had already got the length of opening the hearse to take
the coffin out, when some brighter genius proposed instead, its being
escorted to its destination amidst general rejoicing. Practical suggestions
being much needed, this suggestion, too, was received with acclamation,
and the coach was immediately filled with eight inside and a dozen out,
while as many people got on the roof of the hearse as could by any
exercise of ingenuity stick upon it. Among the first of these volunteers
was Jerry Cruncher himself, who modestly concealed his spiky head
from the observation of Tellson’s, in the further corner of the mourning
coach.
The officiating undertakers made some protest against these changes
in the ceremonies; but, the river being alarmingly near, and several
voices remarking on the efficacy of cold immersion in bringing refractory members of the profession to reason, the protest was faint and
brief. The remodelled procession started, with a chimney-sweep driving the hearse—advised by the regular driver, who was perched beside
him, under close inspection, for the purpose—and with a pieman, also
attended by his cabinet minister, driving the mourning coach. A bearleader, a popular street character of the time, was impressed as an ad136
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
ditional ornament, before the cavalcade had gone far down the Strand;
and his bear, who was black and very mangy, gave quite an Undertaking
air to that part of the procession in which he walked.
Thus, with beer-drinking, pipe-smoking, song-roaring, and infinite
caricaturing of woe, the disorderly procession went its way, recruiting
at every step, and all the shops shutting up before it. Its destination
was the old church of Saint Pancras, far off in the fields. It got there
in course of time; insisted on pouring into the burial-ground; finally,
accomplished the interment of the deceased Roger Cly in its own way,
and highly to its own satisfaction.
The dead man disposed of, and the crowd being under the necessity
of providing some other entertainment for itself, another brighter genius (or perhaps the same) conceived the humour of impeaching casual
passers-by, as Old Bailey spies, and wreaking vengeance on them. Chase
was given to some scores of inoffensive persons who had never been
near the Old Bailey in their lives, in the realisation of this fancy, and
they were roughly hustled and maltreated. The transition to the sport of
window-breaking, and thence to the plundering of public-houses, was
easy and natural. At last, after several hours, when sundry summerhouses had been pulled down, and some area-railings had been torn up,
to arm the more belligerent spirits, a rumour got about that the Guards
were coming. Before this rumour, the crowd gradually melted away, and
perhaps the Guards came, and perhaps they never came, and this was
the usual progress of a mob.
Mr. Cruncher did not assist at the closing sports, but had remained
behind in the churchyard, to confer and condole with the undertakers.
The place had a soothing influence on him. He procured a pipe from
a neighbouring public-house, and smoked it, looking in at the railings
and maturely considering the spot.
“Jerry,” said Mr. Cruncher, apostrophising himself in his usual way,
“you see that there Cly that day, and you see with your own eyes that he
was a young ’un and a straight made ’un.”
Having smoked his pipe out, and ruminated a little longer, he turned
himself about, that he might appear, before the hour of closing, on his
station at Tellson’s. Whether his meditations on mortality had touched
his liver, or whether his general health had been previously at all amiss,
or whether he desired to show a little attention to an eminent man, is not
so much to the purpose, as that he made a short call upon his medical
adviser—a distinguished surgeon—on his way back.
137
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
Young Jerry relieved his father with dutiful interest, and reported
No job in his absence. The bank closed, the ancient clerks came out,
the usual watch was set, and Mr. Cruncher and his son went home to
tea.
“Now, I tell you where it is!” said Mr. Cruncher to his wife, on
entering. “If, as a honest tradesman, my wenturs goes wrong to-night,
I shall make sure that you’ve been praying again me, and I shall work
you for it just the same as if I seen you do it.”
The dejected Mrs. Cruncher shook her head.
“Why, you’re at it afore my face!” said Mr. Cruncher, with signs of
angry apprehension.
“I am saying nothing.”
“Well, then; don’t meditate nothing. You might as well flop as meditate. You may as well go again me one way as another. Drop it altogether.”
“Yes, Jerry.”
“Yes, Jerry,” repeated Mr. Cruncher sitting down to tea. “Ah! It is
yes, Jerry. That’s about it. You may say yes, Jerry.”
Mr. Cruncher had no particular meaning in these sulky corroborations, but made use of them, as people not unfrequently do, to express
general ironical dissatisfaction.
“You and your yes, Jerry,” said Mr. Cruncher, taking a bite out of
his bread-and-butter, and seeming to help it down with a large invisible
oyster out of his saucer. “Ah! I think so. I believe you.”
“You are going out to-night?” asked his decent wife, when he took
another bite.
“Yes, I am.”
“May I go with you, father?” asked his son, briskly.
“No, you mayn’t. I’m a going—as your mother knows—a fishing.
That’s where I’m going to. Going a fishing.”
“Your fishing-rod gets rayther rusty; don’t it, father?”
“Never you mind.”
“Shall you bring any fish home, father?”
“If I don’t, you’ll have short commons, to-morrow,” returned that
gentleman, shaking his head; “that’s questions enough for you; I ain’t a
going out, till you’ve been long abed.”
He devoted himself during the remainder of the evening to keeping
a most vigilant watch on Mrs. Cruncher, and sullenly holding her in
conversation that she might be prevented from meditating any petitions
138
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
to his disadvantage. With this view, he urged his son to hold her in conversation also, and led the unfortunate woman a hard life by dwelling
on any causes of complaint he could bring against her, rather than he
would leave her for a moment to her own reflections. The devoutest person could have rendered no greater homage to the efficacy of an honest
prayer than he did in this distrust of his wife. It was as if a professed
unbeliever in ghosts should be frightened by a ghost story.
“And mind you!” said Mr. Cruncher. “No games to-morrow! If
I, as a honest tradesman, succeed in providing a jinte of meat or two,
none of your not touching of it, and sticking to bread. If I, as a honest
tradesman, am able to provide a little beer, none of your declaring on
water. When you go to Rome, do as Rome does. Rome will be a ugly
customer to you, if you don’t. I’m your Rome, you know.”
Then he began grumbling again:
“With your flying into the face of your own wittles and drink! I
don’t know how scarce you mayn’t make the wittles and drink here, by
your flopping tricks and your unfeeling conduct. Look at your boy: he
is your’n, ain’t he? He’s as thin as a lath. Do you call yourself a mother,
and not know that a mother’s first duty is to blow her boy out?”
This touched Young Jerry on a tender place; who adjured his mother
to perform her first duty, and, whatever else she did or neglected, above
all things to lay especial stress on the discharge of that maternal function
so affectingly and delicately indicated by his other parent.
Thus the evening wore away with the Cruncher family, until Young
Jerry was ordered to bed, and his mother, laid under similar injunctions,
obeyed them. Mr. Cruncher beguiled the earlier watches of the night
with solitary pipes, and did not start upon his excursion until nearly
one o’clock. Towards that small and ghostly hour, he rose up from his
chair, took a key out of his pocket, opened a locked cupboard, and
brought forth a sack, a crowbar of convenient size, a rope and chain,
and other fishing tackle of that nature. Disposing these articles about
him in skilful manner, he bestowed a parting defiance on Mrs. Cruncher,
extinguished the light, and went out.
Young Jerry, who had only made a feint of undressing when he went
to bed, was not long after his father. Under cover of the darkness he
followed out of the room, followed down the stairs, followed down the
court, followed out into the streets. He was in no uneasiness concerning
his getting into the house again, for it was full of lodgers, and the door
stood ajar all night.
139
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
Impelled by a laudable ambition to study the art and mystery of his
father’s honest calling, Young Jerry, keeping as close to house fronts,
walls, and doorways, as his eyes were close to one another, held his honoured parent in view. The honoured parent steering Northward, had
not gone far, when he was joined by another disciple of Izaak Walton,
and the two trudged on together.
Within half an hour from the first starting, they were beyond the
winking lamps, and the more than winking watchmen, and were out
upon a lonely road. Another fisherman was picked up here—and that
so silently, that if Young Jerry had been superstitious, he might have
supposed the second follower of the gentle craft to have, all of a sudden,
split himself into two.
The three went on, and Young Jerry went on, until the three stopped
under a bank overhanging the road. Upon the top of the bank was
a low brick wall, surmounted by an iron railing. In the shadow of
bank and wall the three turned out of the road, and up a blind lane, of
which the wall—there, risen to some eight or ten feet high—formed one
side. Crouching down in a corner, peeping up the lane, the next object
that Young Jerry saw, was the form of his honoured parent, pretty well
defined against a watery and clouded moon, nimbly scaling an iron gate.
He was soon over, and then the second fisherman got over, and then the
third. They all dropped softly on the ground within the gate, and lay
there a little—listening perhaps. Then, they moved away on their hands
and knees.
It was now Young Jerry’s turn to approach the gate: which he did,
holding his breath. Crouching down again in a corner there, and looking in, he made out the three fishermen creeping through some rank
grass! and all the gravestones in the churchyard—it was a large churchyard that they were in—looking on like ghosts in white, while the
church tower itself looked on like the ghost of a monstrous giant. They
did not creep far, before they stopped and stood upright. And then they
began to fish.
They fished with a spade, at first. Presently the honoured parent
appeared to be adjusting some instrument like a great corkscrew. Whatever tools they worked with, they worked hard, until the awful striking
of the church clock so terrified Young Jerry, that he made off, with his
hair as stiff as his father’s.
But, his long-cherished desire to know more about these matters,
not only stopped him in his running away, but lured him back again.
140
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
They were still fishing perseveringly, when he peeped in at the gate for
the second time; but, now they seemed to have got a bite. There was
a screwing and complaining sound down below, and their bent figures
were strained, as if by a weight. By slow degrees the weight broke away
the earth upon it, and came to the surface. Young Jerry very well knew
what it would be; but, when he saw it, and saw his honoured parent
about to wrench it open, he was so frightened, being new to the sight,
that he made off again, and never stopped until he had run a mile or
more.
He would not have stopped then, for anything less necessary than
breath, it being a spectral sort of race that he ran, and one highly desirable to get to the end of. He had a strong idea that the coffin he had seen
was running after him; and, pictured as hopping on behind him, bolt upright, upon its narrow end, always on the point of overtaking him and
hopping on at his side—perhaps taking his arm—it was a pursuer to
shun. It was an inconsistent and ubiquitous fiend too, for, while it was
making the whole night behind him dreadful, he darted out into the
roadway to avoid dark alleys, fearful of its coming hopping out of them
like a dropsical boy’s-Kite without tail and wings. It hid in doorways
too, rubbing its horrible shoulders against doors, and drawing them up
to its ears, as if it were laughing. It got into shadows on the road, and
lay cunningly on its back to trip him up. All this time it was incessantly
hopping on behind and gaining on him, so that when the boy got to his
own door he had reason for being half dead. And even then it would
not leave him, but followed him upstairs with a bump on every stair,
scrambled into bed with him, and bumped down, dead and heavy, on
his breast when he fell asleep.
From his oppressed slumber, Young Jerry in his closet was awakened
after daybreak and before sunrise, by the presence of his father in the
family room. Something had gone wrong with him; at least, so Young
Jerry inferred, from the circumstance of his holding Mrs. Cruncher by
the ears, and knocking the back of her head against the head-board of
the bed.
“I told you I would,” said Mr. Cruncher, “and I did.”
“Jerry, Jerry, Jerry!” his wife implored.
“You oppose yourself to the profit of the business,” said Jerry, “and
me and my partners suffer. You was to honour and obey; why the devil
don’t you?”
“I try to be a good wife, Jerry,” the poor woman protested, with
141
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
tears.
“Is it being a good wife to oppose your husband’s business? Is it
honouring your husband to dishonour his business? Is it obeying your
husband to disobey him on the wital subject of his business?”
“You hadn’t taken to the dreadful business then, Jerry.”
“It’s enough for you,” retorted Mr. Cruncher, “to be the wife of a
honest tradesman, and not to occupy your female mind with calculations when he took to his trade or when he didn’t. A honouring and
obeying wife would let his trade alone altogether. Call yourself a religious woman? If you’re a religious woman, give me a irreligious one!
You have no more nat’ral sense of duty than the bed of this here Thames
river has of a pile, and similarly it must be knocked into you.”
The altercation was conducted in a low tone of voice, and terminated in the honest tradesman’s kicking off his clay-soiled boots, and
lying down at his length on the floor. After taking a timid peep at him
lying on his back, with his rusty hands under his head for a pillow, his
son lay down too, and fell asleep again.
There was no fish for breakfast, and not much of anything else. Mr.
Cruncher was out of spirits, and out of temper, and kept an iron potlid by him as a projectile for the correction of Mrs. Cruncher, in case
he should observe any symptoms of her saying Grace. He was brushed
and washed at the usual hour, and set off with his son to pursue his
ostensible calling.
Young Jerry, walking with the stool under his arm at his father’s
side along sunny and crowded Fleet-street, was a very different Young
Jerry from him of the previous night, running home through darkness
and solitude from his grim pursuer. His cunning was fresh with the day,
and his qualms were gone with the night—in which particulars it is not
improbable that he had compeers in Fleet-street and the City of London,
that fine morning.
“Father,” said Young Jerry, as they walked along: taking care to
keep at arm’s length and to have the stool well between them: “what’s
a Resurrection-Man?”
Mr. Cruncher came to a stop on the pavement before he answered,
“How should I know?”
“I thought you knowed everything, father,” said the artless boy.
“Hem! Well,” returned Mr. Cruncher, going on again, and lifting
off his hat to give his spikes free play, “he’s a tradesman.”
“What’s his goods, father?” asked the brisk Young Jerry.
142
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
“His goods,” said Mr. Cruncher, after turning it over in his mind,
“is a branch of Scientific goods.”
“Persons’ bodies, ain’t it, father?” asked the lively boy.
“I believe it is something of that sort,” said Mr. Cruncher.
“Oh, father, I should so like to be a Resurrection-Man when I’m
quite growed up!”
Mr. Cruncher was soothed, but shook his head in a dubious and
moral way. “It depends upon how you dewelop your talents. Be careful to dewelop your talents, and never to say no more than you can
help to nobody, and there’s no telling at the present time what you may
not come to be fit for.” As Young Jerry, thus encouraged, went on a
few yards in advance, to plant the stool in the shadow of the Bar, Mr.
Cruncher added to himself: “Jerry, you honest tradesman, there’s hopes
wot that boy will yet be a blessing to you, and a recompense to you for
his mother!”
Chapter 15
Knitting
There had been earlier drinking than usual in the wine-shop of Monsieur
Defarge. As early as six o’clock in the morning, sallow faces peeping
through its barred windows had descried other faces within, bending
over measures of wine. Monsieur Defarge sold a very thin wine at the
best of times, but it would seem to have been an unusually thin wine
that he sold at this time. A sour wine, moreover, or a souring, for its
influence on the mood of those who drank it was to make them gloomy.
No vivacious Bacchanalian flame leaped out of the pressed grape of
Monsieur Defarge: but, a smouldering fire that burnt in the dark, lay
hidden in the dregs of it.
This had been the third morning in succession, on which there had
been early drinking at the wine-shop of Monsieur Defarge. It had begun
on Monday, and here was Wednesday come. There had been more of
early brooding than drinking; for, many men had listened and whispered
and slunk about there from the time of the opening of the door, who
could not have laid a piece of money on the counter to save their souls.
These were to the full as interested in the place, however, as if they could
have commanded whole barrels of wine; and they glided from seat to
143
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
seat, and from corner to corner, swallowing talk in lieu of drink, with
greedy looks.
Notwithstanding an unusual flow of company, the master of the
wine-shop was not visible. He was not missed; for, nobody who crossed
the threshold looked for him, nobody asked for him, nobody wondered
to see only Madame Defarge in her seat, presiding over the distribution
of wine, with a bowl of battered small coins before her, as much defaced and beaten out of their original impress as the small coinage of
humanity from whose ragged pockets they had come.
A suspended interest and a prevalent absence of mind, were perhaps
observed by the spies who looked in at the wine-shop, as they looked in
at every place, high and low, from the kings palace to the criminal’s gaol.
Games at cards languished, players at dominoes musingly built towers
with them, drinkers drew figures on the tables with spilt drops of wine,
Madame Defarge herself picked out the pattern on her sleeve with her
toothpick, and saw and heard something inaudible and invisible a long
way off.
Thus, Saint Antoine in this vinous feature of his, until midday. It
was high noontide, when two dusty men passed through his streets and
under his swinging lamps: of whom, one was Monsieur Defarge: the
other a mender of roads in a blue cap. All adust and athirst, the two
entered the wine-shop. Their arrival had lighted a kind of fire in the
breast of Saint Antoine, fast spreading as they came along, which stirred
and flickered in flames of faces at most doors and windows. Yet, no one
had followed them, and no man spoke when they entered the wine-shop,
though the eyes of every man there were turned upon them.
“Good day, gentlemen!” said Monsieur Defarge.
It may have been a signal for loosening the general tongue. It elicited
an answering chorus of “Good day!”
“It is bad weather, gentlemen,” said Defarge, shaking his head.
Upon which, every man looked at his neighbour, and then all cast
down their eyes and sat silent. Except one man, who got up and went
out.
“My wife,” said Defarge aloud, addressing Madame Defarge: “I
have travelled certain leagues with this good mender of roads, called
Jacques. I met him—by accident—a day and half’s journey out of Paris.
He is a good child, this mender of roads, called Jacques. Give him to
drink, my wife!”
A second man got up and went out. Madame Defarge set wine
144
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
before the mender of roads called Jacques, who doffed his blue cap to
the company, and drank. In the breast of his blouse he carried some
coarse dark bread; he ate of this between whiles, and sat munching and
drinking near Madame Defarge’s counter. A third man got up and went
out.
Defarge refreshed himself with a draught of wine—but, he took less
than was given to the stranger, as being himself a man to whom it was no
rarity—and stood waiting until the countryman had made his breakfast.
He looked at no one present, and no one now looked at him; not even
Madame Defarge, who had taken up her knitting, and was at work.
“Have you finished your repast, friend?” he asked, in due season.
“Yes, thank you.”
“Come, then! You shall see the apartment that I told you you could
occupy. It will suit you to a marvel.”
Out of the wine-shop into the street, out of the street into a courtyard, out of the courtyard up a steep staircase, out of the staircase into
a garret,—formerly the garret where a white-haired man sat on a low
bench, stooping forward and very busy, making shoes.
No white-haired man was there now; but, the three men were there
who had gone out of the wine-shop singly. And between them and the
white-haired man afar off, was the one small link, that they had once
looked in at him through the chinks in the wall.
Defarge closed the door carefully, and spoke in a subdued voice:
“Jacques One, Jacques Two, Jacques Three! This is the witness encountered by appointment, by me, Jacques Four. He will tell you all.
Speak, Jacques Five!”
The mender of roads, blue cap in hand, wiped his swarthy forehead
with it, and said, “Where shall I commence, monsieur?”
“Commence,” was Monsieur Defarge’s not unreasonable reply, “at
the commencement.”
“I saw him then, messieurs,” began the mender of roads, “a year ago
this running summer, underneath the carriage of the Marquis, hanging
by the chain. Behold the manner of it. I leaving my work on the road,
the sun going to bed, the carriage of the Marquis slowly ascending the
hill, he hanging by the chain—like this.”
Again the mender of roads went through the whole performance; in
which he ought to have been perfect by that time, seeing that it had been
the infallible resource and indispensable entertainment of his village during a whole year.
145
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
Jacques One struck in, and asked if he had ever seen the man before?
“Never,” answered the mender of roads, recovering his perpendicular.
Jacques Three demanded how he afterwards recognised him then?
“By his tall figure,” said the mender of roads, softly, and with his
finger at his nose. “When Monsieur the Marquis demands that evening,
’Say, what is he like?’ I make response, ‘Tall as a spectre.’ ”
“You should have said, short as a dwarf,” returned Jacques Two.
“But what did I know? The deed was not then accomplished, neither
did he confide in me. Observe! Under those circumstances even, I do
not offer my testimony. Monsieur the Marquis indicates me with his
finger, standing near our little fountain, and says, ‘To me! Bring that
rascal!’ My faith, messieurs, I offer nothing.”
“He is right there, Jacques,” murmured Defarge, to him who had
interrupted. “Go on!”
“Good!” said the mender of roads, with an air of mystery. “The tall
man is lost, and he is sought—how many months? Nine, ten, eleven?”
“No matter, the number,” said Defarge. “He is well hidden, but at
last he is unluckily found. Go on!”
“I am again at work upon the hill-side, and the sun is again about
to go to bed. I am collecting my tools to descend to my cottage down
in the village below, where it is already dark, when I raise my eyes, and
see coming over the hill six soldiers. In the midst of them is a tall man
with his arms bound—tied to his sides—like this!”
With the aid of his indispensable cap, he represented a man with his
elbows bound fast at his hips, with cords that were knotted behind him.
“I stand aside, messieurs, by my heap of stones, to see the soldiers
and their prisoner pass (for it is a solitary road, that, where any spectacle
is well worth looking at), and at first, as they approach, I see no more
than that they are six soldiers with a tall man bound, and that they
are almost black to my sight—except on the side of the sun going to
bed, where they have a red edge, messieurs. Also, I see that their long
shadows are on the hollow ridge on the opposite side of the road, and
are on the hill above it, and are like the shadows of giants. Also, I see
that they are covered with dust, and that the dust moves with them as
they come, tramp, tramp! But when they advance quite near to me, I
recognise the tall man, and he recognises me. Ah, but he would be well
content to precipitate himself over the hill-side once again, as on the
evening when he and I first encountered, close to the same spot!”
146
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
He described it as if he were there, and it was evident that he saw it
vividly; perhaps he had not seen much in his life.
“I do not show the soldiers that I recognise the tall man; he does
not show the soldiers that he recognises me; we do it, and we know
it, with our eyes. ‘Come on!’ says the chief of that company, pointing
to the village, ‘bring him fast to his tomb!’ and they bring him faster.
I follow. His arms are swelled because of being bound so tight, his
wooden shoes are large and clumsy, and he is lame. Because he is lame,
and consequently slow, they drive him with their guns—like this!”
He imitated the action of a man’s being impelled forward by the
butt-ends of muskets.
“As they descend the hill like madmen running a race, he falls. They
laugh and pick him up again. His face is bleeding and covered with
dust, but he cannot touch it; thereupon they laugh again. They bring
him into the village; all the village runs to look; they take him past the
mill, and up to the prison; all the village sees the prison gate open in the
darkness of the night, and swallow him—like this!”
He opened his mouth as wide as he could, and shut it with a sounding snap of his teeth. Observant of his unwillingness to mar the effect
by opening it again, Defarge said, “Go on, Jacques.”
“All the village,” pursued the mender of roads, on tiptoe and in a
low voice, “withdraws; all the village whispers by the fountain; all the
village sleeps; all the village dreams of that unhappy one, within the
locks and bars of the prison on the crag, and never to come out of
it, except to perish. In the morning, with my tools upon my shoulder,
eating my morsel of black bread as I go, I make a circuit by the prison,
on my way to my work. There I see him, high up, behind the bars of a
lofty iron cage, bloody and dusty as last night, looking through. He has
no hand free, to wave to me; I dare not call to him; he regards me like a
dead man.”
Defarge and the three glanced darkly at one another. The looks of
all of them were dark, repressed, and revengeful, as they listened to the
countryman’s story; the manner of all of them, while it was secret, was
authoritative too. They had the air of a rough tribunal; Jacques One and
Two sitting on the old pallet-bed, each with his chin resting on his hand,
and his eyes intent on the road-mender; Jacques Three, equally intent,
on one knee behind them, with his agitated hand always gliding over
the network of fine nerves about his mouth and nose; Defarge standing
between them and the narrator, whom he had stationed in the light of
147
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
the window, by turns looking from him to them, and from them to him.
“Go on, Jacques,” said Defarge.
“He remains up there in his iron cage some days. The village looks
at him by stealth, for it is afraid. But it always looks up, from a distance,
at the prison on the crag; and in the evening, when the work of the day is
achieved and it assembles to gossip at the fountain, all faces are turned
towards the prison. Formerly, they were turned towards the postinghouse; now, they are turned towards the prison. They whisper at the
fountain, that although condemned to death he will not be executed;
they say that petitions have been presented in Paris, showing that he
was enraged and made mad by the death of his child; they say that a
petition has been presented to the King himself. What do I know? It is
possible. Perhaps yes, perhaps no.”
“Listen then, Jacques,” Number One of that name sternly interposed. “Know that a petition was presented to the King and Queen.
All here, yourself excepted, saw the King take it, in his carriage in the
street, sitting beside the Queen. It is Defarge whom you see here, who,
at the hazard of his life, darted out before the horses, with the petition
in his hand.”
“And once again listen, Jacques!” said the kneeling Number Three:
his fingers ever wandering over and over those fine nerves, with a strikingly greedy air, as if he hungered for something—that was neither food
nor drink; “the guard, horse and foot, surrounded the petitioner, and
struck him blows. You hear?”
“I hear, messieurs.”
“Go on then,” said Defarge.
“Again; on the other hand, they whisper at the fountain,” resumed
the countryman, “that he is brought down into our country to be executed on the spot, and that he will very certainly be executed. They
even whisper that because he has slain Monseigneur, and because Monseigneur was the father of his tenants—serfs—what you will—he will be
executed as a parricide. One old man says at the fountain, that his right
hand, armed with the knife, will be burnt off before his face; that, into
wounds which will be made in his arms, his breast, and his legs, there
will be poured boiling oil, melted lead, hot resin, wax, and sulphur; finally, that he will be torn limb from limb by four strong horses. That
old man says, all this was actually done to a prisoner who made an attempt on the life of the late King, Louis Fifteen. But how do I know if
he lies? I am not a scholar.”
148
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
“Listen once again then, Jacques!” said the man with the restless
hand and the craving air. “The name of that prisoner was Damiens,
and it was all done in open day, in the open streets of this city of Paris;
and nothing was more noticed in the vast concourse that saw it done,
than the crowd of ladies of quality and fashion, who were full of eager attention to the last—to the last, Jacques, prolonged until nightfall,
when he had lost two legs and an arm, and still breathed! And it was
done—why, how old are you?”
“Thirty-five,” said the mender of roads, who looked sixty.
“It was done when you were more than ten years old; you might
have seen it.”
“Enough!” said Defarge, with grim impatience. “Long live the
Devil! Go on.”
“Well! Some whisper this, some whisper that; they speak of nothing
else; even the fountain appears to fall to that tune. At length, on Sunday
night when all the village is asleep, come soldiers, winding down from
the prison, and their guns ring on the stones of the little street. Workmen
dig, workmen hammer, soldiers laugh and sing; in the morning, by the
fountain, there is raised a gallows forty feet high, poisoning the water.”
The mender of roads looked through rather than at the low ceiling,
and pointed as if he saw the gallows somewhere in the sky.
“All work is stopped, all assemble there, nobody leads the cows out,
the cows are there with the rest. At midday, the roll of drums. Soldiers
have marched into the prison in the night, and he is in the midst of many
soldiers. He is bound as before, and in his mouth there is a gag—tied
so, with a tight string, making him look almost as if he laughed.” He
suggested it, by creasing his face with his two thumbs, from the corners
of his mouth to his ears. “On the top of the gallows is fixed the knife,
blade upwards, with its point in the air. He is hanged there forty feet
high—and is left hanging, poisoning the water.”
They looked at one another, as he used his blue cap to wipe his
face, on which the perspiration had started afresh while he recalled the
spectacle.
“It is frightful, messieurs. How can the women and the children
draw water! Who can gossip of an evening, under that shadow! Under
it, have I said? When I left the village, Monday evening as the sun was
going to bed, and looked back from the hill, the shadow struck across
the church, across the mill, across the prison—seemed to strike across
the earth, messieurs, to where the sky rests upon it!”
149
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
The hungry man gnawed one of his fingers as he looked at the other
three, and his finger quivered with the craving that was on him.
“That’s all, messieurs. I left at sunset (as I had been warned to do),
and I walked on, that night and half next day, until I met (as I was
warned I should) this comrade. With him, I came on, now riding and
now walking, through the rest of yesterday and through last night. And
here you see me!”
After a gloomy silence, the first Jacques said, “Good! You have
acted and recounted faithfully. Will you wait for us a little, outside the
door?”
“Very willingly,” said the mender of roads. Whom Defarge escorted
to the top of the stairs, and, leaving seated there, returned.
The three had risen, and their heads were together when he came
back to the garret.
“How say you, Jacques?” demanded Number One. “To be registered?”
“To be registered, as doomed to destruction,” returned Defarge.
“Magnificent!” croaked the man with the craving.
“The chateau, and all the race?” inquired the first.
“The chateau and all the race,” returned Defarge. “Extermination.”
The hungry man repeated, in a rapturous croak, “Magnificent!” and
began gnawing another finger.
“Are you sure,” asked Jacques Two, of Defarge, “that no embarrassment can arise from our manner of keeping the register? Without
doubt it is safe, for no one beyond ourselves can decipher it; but shall
we always be able to decipher it—or, I ought to say, will she?”
“Jacques,” returned Defarge, drawing himself up, “if madame my
wife undertook to keep the register in her memory alone, she would not
lose a word of it—not a syllable of it. Knitted, in her own stitches and
her own symbols, it will always be as plain to her as the sun. Confide in
Madame Defarge. It would be easier for the weakest poltroon that lives,
to erase himself from existence, than to erase one letter of his name or
crimes from the knitted register of Madame Defarge.”
There was a murmur of confidence and approval, and then the man
who hungered, asked: “Is this rustic to be sent back soon? I hope so.
He is very simple; is he not a little dangerous?”
“He knows nothing,” said Defarge; “at least nothing more than
would easily elevate himself to a gallows of the same height. I charge
myself with him; let him remain with me; I will take care of him, and set
150
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
him on his road. He wishes to see the fine world—the King, the Queen,
and Court; let him see them on Sunday.”
“What?” exclaimed the hungry man, staring. “Is it a good sign, that
he wishes to see Royalty and Nobility?”
“Jacques,” said Defarge; “judiciously show a cat milk, if you wish
her to thirst for it. Judiciously show a dog his natural prey, if you wish
him to bring it down one day.”
Nothing more was said, and the mender of roads, being found already dozing on the topmost stair, was advised to lay himself down on
the pallet-bed and take some rest. He needed no persuasion, and was
soon asleep.
Worse quarters than Defarge’s wine-shop, could easily have been
found in Paris for a provincial slave of that degree. Saving for a mysterious dread of madame by which he was constantly haunted, his life
was very new and agreeable. But, madame sat all day at her counter,
so expressly unconscious of him, and so particularly determined not to
perceive that his being there had any connection with anything below
the surface, that he shook in his wooden shoes whenever his eye lighted
on her. For, he contended with himself that it was impossible to foresee
what that lady might pretend next; and he felt assured that if she should
take it into her brightly ornamented head to pretend that she had seen
him do a murder and afterwards flay the victim, she would infallibly go
through with it until the play was played out.
Therefore, when Sunday came, the mender of roads was not enchanted (though he said he was) to find that madame was to accompany
monsieur and himself to Versailles. It was additionally disconcerting to
have madame knitting all the way there, in a public conveyance; it was
additionally disconcerting yet, to have madame in the crowd in the afternoon, still with her knitting in her hands as the crowd waited to see
the carriage of the King and Queen.
“You work hard, madame,” said a man near her.
“Yes,” answered Madame Defarge; “I have a good deal to do.”
“What do you make, madame?”
“Many things.”
“For instance—”
“For instance,” returned Madame Defarge, composedly, “shrouds.”
The man moved a little further away, as soon as he could, and the
mender of roads fanned himself with his blue cap: feeling it mightily
close and oppressive. If he needed a King and Queen to restore him, he
151
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
was fortunate in having his remedy at hand; for, soon the large-faced
King and the fair-faced Queen came in their golden coach, attended by
the shining Bull’s Eye of their Court, a glittering multitude of laughing
ladies and fine lords; and in jewels and silks and powder and splendour
and elegantly spurning figures and handsomely disdainful faces of both
sexes, the mender of roads bathed himself, so much to his temporary intoxication, that he cried Long live the King, Long live the Queen, Long
live everybody and everything! as if he had never heard of ubiquitous
Jacques in his time. Then, there were gardens, courtyards, terraces, fountains, green banks, more King and Queen, more Bull’s Eye,more lords
and ladies, more Long live they all! until he absolutely wept with sentiment. During the whole of this scene, which lasted some three hours,
he had plenty of shouting and weeping and sentimental company, and
throughout Defarge held him by the collar, as if to restrain him from
flying at the objects of his brief devotion and tearing them to pieces.
“Bravo!” said Defarge, clapping him on the back when it was over,
like a patron; “you are a good boy!”
The mender of roads was now coming to himself, and was mistrustful of having made a mistake in his late demonstrations; but no.
“You are the fellow we want,” said Defarge, in his ear; “you make
these fools believe that it will last for ever. Then, they are the more
insolent, and it is the nearer ended.”
“Hey!” cried the mender of roads, reflectively; “that’s true.”
“These fools know nothing. While they despise your breath, and
would stop it for ever and ever, in you or in a hundred like you rather
than in one of their own horses or dogs, they only know what your
breath tells them. Let it deceive them, then, a little longer; it cannot
deceive them too much.”
Madame Defarge looked superciliously at the client, and nodded in
confirmation.
“As to you,” said she, “you would shout and shed tears for anything,
if it made a show and a noise. Say! Would you not?”
“Truly, madame, I think so. For the moment.”
“If you were shown a great heap of dolls, and were set upon them
to pluck them to pieces and despoil them for your own advantage, you
would pick out the richest and gayest. Say! Would you not?”
“Truly yes, madame.”
“Yes. And if you were shown a flock of birds, unable to fly, and were
set upon them to strip them of their feathers for your own advantage,
152
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
you would set upon the birds of the finest feathers; would you not?”
“It is true, madame.”
“You have seen both dolls and birds to-day,” said Madame Defarge,
with a wave of her hand towards the place where they had last been
apparent; “now, go home!”
Chapter 16
Still Knitting
Madame Defarge and monsieur her husband returned amicably to the
bosom of Saint Antoine, while a speck in a blue cap toiled through the
darkness, and through the dust, and down the weary miles of avenue by
the wayside, slowly tending towards that point of the compass where
the chateau of Monsieur the Marquis, now in his grave, listened to the
whispering trees. Such ample leisure had the stone faces, now, for listening to the trees and to the fountain, that the few village scarecrows
who, in their quest for herbs to eat and fragments of dead stick to burn,
strayed within sight of the great stone courtyard and terrace staircase,
had it borne in upon their starved fancy that the expression of the faces
was altered. A rumour just lived in the village—had a faint and bare
existence there, as its people had—that when the knife struck home, the
faces changed, from faces of pride to faces of anger and pain; also, that
when that dangling figure was hauled up forty feet above the fountain,
they changed again, and bore a cruel look of being avenged, which they
would henceforth bear for ever. In the stone face over the great window of the bed-chamber where the murder was done, two fine dints
were pointed out in the sculptured nose, which everybody recognised,
and which nobody had seen of old; and on the scarce occasions when
two or three ragged peasants emerged from the crowd to take a hurried
peep at Monsieur the Marquis petrified, a skinny finger would not have
pointed to it for a minute, before they all started away among the moss
and leaves, like the more fortunate hares who could find a living there.
Chateau and hut, stone face and dangling figure, the red stain on the
stone floor, and the pure water in the village well—thousands of acres
of land—a whole province of France—all France itself—lay under the
night sky, concentrated into a faint hair-breadth line. So does a whole
world, with all its greatnesses and littlenesses, lie in a twinkling star.
153
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
And as mere human knowledge can split a ray of light and analyse the
manner of its composition, so, sublimer intelligences may read in the
feeble shining of this earth of ours, every thought and act, every vice
and virtue, of every responsible creature on it.
The Defarges, husband and wife, came lumbering under the starlight,
in their public vehicle, to that gate of Paris whereunto their journey naturally tended. There was the usual stoppage at the barrier guardhouse,
and the usual lanterns came glancing forth for the usual examination
and inquiry. Monsieur Defarge alighted; knowing one or two of the
soldiery there, and one of the police. The latter he was intimate with,
and affectionately embraced.
When Saint Antoine had again enfolded the Defarges in his dusky
wings, and they, having finally alighted near the Saint’s boundaries, were
picking their way on foot through the black mud and offal of his streets,
Madame Defarge spoke to her husband:
“Say then, my friend; what did Jacques of the police tell thee?”
“Very little to-night, but all he knows. There is another spy commissioned for our quarter. There may be many more, for all that he can say,
but he knows of one.”
“Eh well!” said Madame Defarge, raising her eyebrows with a cool
business air. “It is necessary to register him. How do they call that
man?”
“He is English.”
“So much the better. His name?”
“Barsad,” said Defarge, making it French by pronunciation. But, he
had been so careful to get it accurately, that he then spelt it with perfect
correctness.
“Barsad,” repeated madame. “Good. Christian name?”
“John.”
“John Barsad,” repeated madame, after murmuring it once to herself. “Good. His appearance; is it known?”
“Age, about forty years; height, about five feet nine; black hair; complexion dark; generally, rather handsome visage; eyes dark, face thin,
long, and sallow; nose aquiline, but not straight, having a peculiar inclination towards the left cheek; expression, therefore, sinister.”
“Eh my faith. It is a portrait!” said madame, laughing. “He shall be
registered to-morrow.”
They turned into the wine-shop, which was closed (for it was midnight), and where Madame Defarge immediately took her post at her
154
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
desk, counted the small moneys that had been taken during her absence,
examined the stock, went through the entries in the book, made other
entries of her own, checked the serving man in every possible way, and
finally dismissed him to bed. Then she turned out the contents of the
bowl of money for the second time, and began knotting them up in her
handkerchief, in a chain of separate knots, for safe keeping through the
night. All this while, Defarge, with his pipe in his mouth, walked up
and down, complacently admiring, but never interfering; in which condition, indeed, as to the business and his domestic affairs, he walked up
and down through life.
The night was hot, and the shop, close shut and surrounded by so
foul a neighbourhood, was ill-smelling. Monsieur Defarge’s olfactory
sense was by no means delicate, but the stock of wine smelt much
stronger than it ever tasted, and so did the stock of rum and brandy
and aniseed. He whiffed the compound of scents away, as he put down
his smoked-out pipe.
“You are fatigued,” said madame, raising her glance as she knotted
the money. “There are only the usual odours.”
“I am a little tired,” her husband acknowledged.
“You are a little depressed, too,” said madame, whose quick eyes
had never been so intent on the accounts, but they had had a ray or two
for him. “Oh, the men, the men!”
“But my dear!” began Defarge.
“But my dear!” repeated madame, nodding firmly; “but my dear!
You are faint of heart to-night, my dear!”
“Well, then,” said Defarge, as if a thought were wrung out of his
breast, “it is a long time.”
“It is a long time,” repeated his wife; “and when is it not a long
time? Vengeance and retribution require a long time; it is the rule.”
“It does not take a long time to strike a man with Lightning,” said
Defarge.
“How long,” demanded madame, composedly, “does it take to
make and store the lightning? Tell me.”
Defarge raised his head thoughtfully, as if there were something in
that too.
“It does not take a long time,” said madame, “for an earthquake
to swallow a town. Eh well! Tell me how long it takes to prepare the
earthquake?”
“A long time, I suppose,” said Defarge.
155
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
“But when it is ready, it takes place, and grinds to pieces everything
before it. In the meantime, it is always preparing, though it is not seen
or heard. That is your consolation. Keep it.”
She tied a knot with flashing eyes, as if it throttled a foe.
“I tell thee,” said madame, extending her right hand, for emphasis,
“that although it is a long time on the road, it is on the road and coming. I tell thee it never retreats, and never stops. I tell thee it is always
advancing. Look around and consider the lives of all the world that we
know, consider the faces of all the world that we know, consider the
rage and discontent to which the Jacquerie addresses itself with more
and more of certainty every hour. Can such things last? Bah! I mock
you.”
“My brave wife,” returned Defarge, standing before her with his
head a little bent, and his hands clasped at his back, like a docile and
attentive pupil before his catechist, “I do not question all this. But it
has lasted a long time, and it is possible—you know well, my wife, it is
possible—that it may not come, during our lives.”
“Eh well! How then?” demanded madame, tying another knot, as
if there were another enemy strangled.
“Well!” said Defarge, with a half complaining and half apologetic
shrug. “We shall not see the triumph.”
“We shall have helped it,” returned madame, with her extended
hand in strong action. “Nothing that we do, is done in vain. I believe,
with all my soul, that we shall see the triumph. But even if not, even if
I knew certainly not, show me the neck of an aristocrat and tyrant, and
still I would—”
Then madame, with her teeth set, tied a very terrible knot indeed.
“Hold!” cried Defarge, reddening a little as if he felt charged with
cowardice; “I too, my dear, will stop at nothing.”
“Yes! But it is your weakness that you sometimes need to see your
victim and your opportunity, to sustain you. Sustain yourself without
that. When the time comes, let loose a tiger and a devil; but wait for
the time with the tiger and the devil chained—not shown—yet always
ready.”
Madame enforced the conclusion of this piece of advice by striking her little counter with her chain of money as if she knocked its
brains out, and then gathering the heavy handkerchief under her arm in
a serene manner, and observing that it was time to go to bed.
Next noontide saw the admirable woman in her usual place in the
156
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
wine-shop, knitting away assiduously. A rose lay beside her, and if she
now and then glanced at the flower, it was with no infraction of her
usual preoccupied air. There were a few customers, drinking or not
drinking, standing or seated, sprinkled about. The day was very hot,
and heaps of flies, who were extending their inquisitive and adventurous
perquisitions into all the glutinous little glasses near madame, fell dead
at the bottom. Their decease made no impression on the other flies
out promenading, who looked at them in the coolest manner (as if they
themselves were elephants, or something as far removed), until they met
the same fate. Curious to consider how heedless flies are!—perhaps they
thought as much at Court that sunny summer day.
A figure entering at the door threw a shadow on Madame Defarge
which she felt to be a new one. She laid down her knitting, and began
to pin her rose in her head-dress, before she looked at the figure.
It was curious. The moment Madame Defarge took up the rose, the
customers ceased talking, and began gradually to drop out of the wineshop.
“Good day, madame,” said the new-comer.
“Good day, monsieur.”
She said it aloud, but added to herself, as she resumed her knitting:
“Hah! Good day, age about forty, height about five feet nine, black hair,
generally rather handsome visage, complexion dark, eyes dark, thin,
long and sallow face, aquiline nose but not straight, having a peculiar
inclination towards the left cheek which imparts a sinister expression!
Good day, one and all!”
“Have the goodness to give me a little glass of old cognac, and a
mouthful of cool fresh water, madame.”
Madame complied with a polite air.
“Marvellous cognac this, madame!”
It was the first time it had ever been so complemented, and Madame
Defarge knew enough of its antecedents to know better. She said, however, that the cognac was flattered, and took up her knitting. The visitor
watched her fingers for a few moments, and took the opportunity of
observing the place in general.
“You knit with great skill, madame.”
“I am accustomed to it.”
“A pretty pattern too!”
“You think so?” said madame, looking at him with a smile.
“Decidedly. May one ask what it is for?”
157
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
“Pastime,” said madame, still looking at him with a smile while her
fingers moved nimbly.
“Not for use?”
“That depends. I may find a use for it one day. If I do—Well,” said
madame, drawing a breath and nodding her head with a stern kind of
coquetry, “I’ll use it!”
It was remarkable; but, the taste of Saint Antoine seemed to be decidedly opposed to a rose on the head-dress of Madame Defarge. Two
men had entered separately, and had been about to order drink, when,
catching sight of that novelty, they faltered, made a pretence of looking
about as if for some friend who was not there, and went away. Nor, of
those who had been there when this visitor entered, was there one left.
They had all dropped off. The spy had kept his eyes open, but had been
able to detect no sign. They had lounged away in a poverty-stricken,
purposeless, accidental manner, quite natural and unimpeachable.
“John,” thought madame, checking off her work as her fingers knitted, and her eyes looked at the stranger. “Stay long enough, and I shall
knit ‘Barsad’ before you go.”
“You have a husband, madame?”
“I have.”
“Children?”
“No children.”
“Business seems bad?”
“Business is very bad; the people are so poor.”
“Ah, the unfortunate, miserable people! So oppressed, too—as you
say.”
“As you say,” madame retorted, correcting him, and deftly knitting
an extra something into his name that boded him no good.
“Pardon me; certainly it was I who said so, but you naturally think
so. Of course.”
“I think?” returned madame, in a high voice. “I and my husband
have enough to do to keep this wine-shop open, without thinking. All
we think, here, is how to live. That is the subject we think of, and it
gives us, from morning to night, enough to think about, without embarrassing our heads concerning others. I think for others? No, no.”
The spy, who was there to pick up any crumbs he could find or make,
did not allow his baffled state to express itself in his sinister face; but,
stood with an air of gossiping gallantry, leaning his elbow on Madame
Defarge’s little counter, and occasionally sipping his cognac.
158
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
“A bad business this, madame, of Gaspard’s execution. Ah! the
poor Gaspard!” With a sigh of great compassion.
“My faith!” returned madame, coolly and lightly, “if people use
knives for such purposes, they have to pay for it. He knew beforehand
what the price of his luxury was; he has paid the price.”
“I believe,” said the spy, dropping his soft voice to a tone that invited confidence, and expressing an injured revolutionary susceptibility
in every muscle of his wicked face: “I believe there is much compassion
and anger in this neighbourhood, touching the poor fellow? Between
ourselves.”
“Is there?” asked madame, vacantly.
“Is there not?”
“—Here is my husband!” said Madame Defarge.
As the keeper of the wine-shop entered at the door, the spy saluted
him by touching his hat, and saying, with an engaging smile, “Good
day, Jacques!” Defarge stopped short, and stared at him.
“Good day, Jacques!” the spy repeated; with not quite so much
confidence, or quite so easy a smile under the stare.
“You deceive yourself, monsieur,” returned the keeper of the wineshop. “You mistake me for another. That is not my name. I am Ernest
Defarge.”
“It is all the same,” said the spy, airily, but discomfited too: “good
day!”
“Good day!” answered Defarge, drily.
“I was saying to madame, with whom I had the pleasure of chatting
when you entered, that they tell me there is—and no wonder!—much
sympathy and anger in Saint Antoine, touching the unhappy fate of poor
Gaspard.”
“No one has told me so,” said Defarge, shaking his head. “I know
nothing of it.”
Having said it, he passed behind the little counter, and stood with
his hand on the back of his wife’s chair, looking over that barrier at
the person to whom they were both opposed, and whom either of them
would have shot with the greatest satisfaction.
The spy, well used to his business, did not change his unconscious
attitude, but drained his little glass of cognac, took a sip of fresh water,
and asked for another glass of cognac. Madame Defarge poured it out
for him, took to her knitting again, and hummed a little song over it.
“You seem to know this quarter well; that is to say, better than I
159
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
do?” observed Defarge.
“Not at all, but I hope to know it better. I am so profoundly interested in its miserable inhabitants.”
“Hah!” muttered Defarge.
“The pleasure of conversing with you, Monsieur Defarge, recalls
to me,” pursued the spy, “that I have the honour of cherishing some
interesting associations with your name.”
“Indeed!” said Defarge, with much indifference.
“Yes, indeed. When Doctor Manette was released, you, his old domestic, had the charge of him, I know. He was delivered to you. You
see I am informed of the circumstances?”
“Such is the fact, certainly,” said Defarge. He had had it conveyed
to him, in an accidental touch of his wife’s elbow as she knitted and
warbled, that he would do best to answer, but always with brevity.
“It was to you,” said the spy, “that his daughter came; and it was
from your care that his daughter took him, accompanied by a neat
brown monsieur; how is he called?—in a little wig—Lorry—of the bank
of Tellson and Company—over to England.”
“Such is the fact,” repeated Defarge.
“Very interesting remembrances!” said the spy. “I have known Doctor Manette and his daughter, in England.”
“Yes?” said Defarge.
“You don’t hear much about them now?” said the spy.
“No,” said Defarge.
“In effect,” madame struck in, looking up from her work and her
little song, “we never hear about them. We received the news of their
safe arrival, and perhaps another letter, or perhaps two; but, since then,
they have gradually taken their road in life—we, ours—and we have
held no correspondence.”
“Perfectly so, madame,” replied the spy. “She is going to be married.”
“Going?” echoed madame. “She was pretty enough to have been
married long ago. You English are cold, it seems to me.”
“Oh! You know I am English.”
“I perceive your tongue is,” returned madame; “and what the
tongue is, I suppose the man is.”
He did not take the identification as a compliment; but he made the
best of it, and turned it off with a laugh. After sipping his cognac to the
end, he added:
160
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
“Yes, Miss Manette is going to be married. But not to an Englishman; to one who, like herself, is French by birth. And speaking of Gaspard (ah, poor Gaspard! It was cruel, cruel!), it is a curious thing that
she is going to marry the nephew of Monsieur the Marquis, for whom
Gaspard was exalted to that height of so many feet; in other words, the
present Marquis. But he lives unknown in England, he is no Marquis
there; he is Mr. Charles Darnay. D’Aulnais is the name of his mother’s
family.”
Madame Defarge knitted steadily, but the intelligence had a palpable
effect upon her husband. Do what he would, behind the little counter,
as to the striking of a light and the lighting of his pipe, he was troubled,
and his hand was not trustworthy. The spy would have been no spy if
he had failed to see it, or to record it in his mind.
Having made, at least, this one hit, whatever it might prove to be
worth, and no customers coming in to help him to any other, Mr. Barsad
paid for what he had drunk, and took his leave: taking occasion to
say, in a genteel manner, before he departed, that he looked forward
to the pleasure of seeing Monsieur and Madame Defarge again. For
some minutes after he had emerged into the outer presence of Saint
Antoine, the husband and wife remained exactly as he had left them,
lest he should come back.
“Can it be true,” said Defarge, in a low voice, looking down at his
wife as he stood smoking with his hand on the back of her chair: “what
he has said of Ma’amselle Manette?”
“As he has said it,” returned madame, lifting her eyebrows a little,
“it is probably false. But it may be true.”
“If it is—” Defarge began, and stopped.
“If it is?” repeated his wife.
“—And if it does come, while we live to see it triumph—I hope, for
her sake, Destiny will keep her husband out of France.”
“Her husband’s destiny,” said Madame Defarge, with her usual composure, “will take him where he is to go, and will lead him to the end
that is to end him. That is all I know.”
“But it is very strange—now, at least, is it not very strange”—said
Defarge, rather pleading with his wife to induce her to admit it, “that,
after all our sympathy for Monsieur her father, and herself, her husband’s name should be proscribed under your hand at this moment, by
the side of that infernal dog’s who has just left us?”
“Stranger things than that will happen when it does come,” an161
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
swered madame. “I have them both here, of a certainty; and they are
both here for their merits; that is enough.”
She roiled up her knitting when she had said those words, and
presently took the rose out of the handkerchief that was wound about
her head. Either Saint Antoine had an instinctive sense that the objectionable decoration was gone, or Saint Antoine was on the watch for
its disappearance; howbeit, the Saint took courage to lounge in, very
shortly afterwards, and the wine-shop recovered its habitual aspect.
In the evening, at which season of all others Saint Antoine turned
himself inside out, and sat on door-steps and window-ledges, and came
to the corners of vile streets and courts, for a breath of air, Madame
Defarge with her work in her hand was accustomed to pass from place
to place and from group to group: a Missionary—there were many like
her—such as the world will do well never to breed again. All the women
knitted. They knitted worthless things; but, the mechanical work was a
mechanical substitute for eating and drinking; the hands moved for the
jaws and the digestive apparatus: if the bony fingers had been still, the
stomachs would have been more famine-pinched.
But, as the fingers went, the eyes went, and the thoughts. And as
Madame Defarge moved on from group to group, all three went quicker
and fiercer among every little knot of women that she had spoken with,
and left behind.
Her husband smoked at his door, looking after her with admiration.
“A great woman,” said he, “a strong woman, a grand woman, a frightfully grand woman!”
Darkness closed around, and then came the ringing of church bells
and the distant beating of the military drums in the Palace Courtyard,
as the women sat knitting, knitting. Darkness encompassed them. Another darkness was closing in as surely, when the church bells, then ringing pleasantly in many an airy steeple over France, should be melted
into thundering cannon; when the military drums should be beating to
drown a wretched voice, that night all potent as the voice of Power and
Plenty, Freedom and Life. So much was closing in about the women
who sat knitting, knitting, that they their very selves were closing in
around a structure yet unbuilt, where they were to sit knitting, knitting,
counting dropping heads.
162
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
Chapter 17
One Night
Never did the sun go down with a brighter glory on the quiet corner in
Soho, than one memorable evening when the Doctor and his daughter
sat under the plane-tree together. Never did the moon rise with a milder
radiance over great London, than on that night when it found them still
seated under the tree, and shone upon their faces through its leaves.
Lucie was to be married to-morrow. She had reserved this last
evening for her father, and they sat alone under the plane-tree.
“You are happy, my dear father?”
“Quite, my child.”
They had said little, though they had been there a long time. When it
was yet light enough to work and read, she had neither engaged herself
in her usual work, nor had she read to him. She had employed herself in
both ways, at his side under the tree, many and many a time; but, this
time was not quite like any other, and nothing could make it so.
“And I am very happy to-night, dear father. I am deeply happy in
the love that Heaven has so blessed—my love for Charles, and Charles’s
love for me. But, if my life were not to be still consecrated to you, or
if my marriage were so arranged as that it would part us, even by the
length of a few of these streets, I should be more unhappy and selfreproachful now than I can tell you. Even as it is—”
Even as it was, she could not command her voice.
In the sad moonlight, she clasped him by the neck, and laid her face
upon his breast. In the moonlight which is always sad, as the light of
the sun itself is—as the light called human life is—at its coming and its
going.
“Dearest dear! Can you tell me, this last time, that you feel quite,
quite sure, no new affections of mine, and no new duties of mine, will
ever interpose between us? I know it well, but do you know it? In your
own heart, do you feel quite certain?”
Her father answered, with a cheerful firmness of conviction he could
scarcely have assumed, “Quite sure, my darling! More than that,” he
added, as he tenderly kissed her: “my future is far brighter, Lucie, seen
through your marriage, than it could have been—nay, than it ever was—
without it.”
“If I could hope that, my father!—”
163
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
“Believe it, love! Indeed it is so. Consider how natural and how
plain it is, my dear, that it should be so. You, devoted and young, cannot fully appreciate the anxiety I have felt that your life should not be
wasted—”
She moved her hand towards his lips, but he took it in his, and
repeated the word.
“—wasted, my child—should not be wasted, struck aside from the
natural order of things—for my sake. Your unselfishness cannot entirely
comprehend how much my mind has gone on this; but, only ask yourself, how could my happiness be perfect, while yours was incomplete?”
“If I had never seen Charles, my father, I should have been quite
happy with you.”
He smiled at her unconscious admission that she would have been
unhappy without Charles, having seen him; and replied:
“My child, you did see him, and it is Charles. If it had not been
Charles, it would have been another. Or, if it had been no other, I
should have been the cause, and then the dark part of my life would
have cast its shadow beyond myself, and would have fallen on you.”
It was the first time, except at the trial, of her ever hearing him
refer to the period of his suffering. It gave her a strange and new sensation while his words were in her ears; and she remembered it long
afterwards.
“See!” said the Doctor of Beauvais, raising his hand towards the
moon. “I have looked at her from my prison-window, when I could not
bear her light. I have looked at her when it has been such torture to
me to think of her shining upon what I had lost, that I have beaten my
head against my prison-walls. I have looked at her, in a state so dun and
lethargic, that I have thought of nothing but the number of horizontal
lines I could draw across her at the full, and the number of perpendicular
lines with which I could intersect them.” He added in his inward and
pondering manner, as he looked at the moon, “It was twenty either way,
I remember, and the twentieth was difficult to squeeze in.”
The strange thrill with which she heard him go back to that time,
deepened as he dwelt upon it; but, there was nothing to shock her in
the manner of his reference. He only seemed to contrast his present
cheerfulness and felicity with the dire endurance that was over.
“I have looked at her, speculating thousands of times upon the unborn child from whom I had been rent. Whether it was alive. Whether it
had been born alive, or the poor mother’s shock had killed it. Whether
164
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
it was a son who would some day avenge his father. (There was a
time in my imprisonment, when my desire for vengeance was unbearable.) Whether it was a son who would never know his father’s story;
who might even live to weigh the possibility of his father’s having disappeared of his own will and act. Whether it was a daughter who would
grow to be a woman.”
She drew closer to him, and kissed his cheek and his hand.
“I have pictured my daughter, to myself, as perfectly forgetful of
me—rather, altogether ignorant of me, and unconscious of me. I have
cast up the years of her age, year after year. I have seen her married to
a man who knew nothing of my fate. I have altogether perished from
the remembrance of the living, and in the next generation my place was
a blank.”
“My father! Even to hear that you had such thoughts of a daughter
who never existed, strikes to my heart as if I had been that child.”
“You, Lucie? It is out of the Consolation and restoration you have
brought to me, that these remembrances arise, and pass between us and
the moon on this last night.—What did I say just now?”
“She knew nothing of you. She cared nothing for you.”
“So! But on other moonlight nights, when the sadness and the silence have touched me in a different way—have affected me with something as like a sorrowful sense of peace, as any emotion that had pain
for its foundations could—I have imagined her as coming to me in my
cell, and leading me out into the freedom beyond the fortress. I have
seen her image in the moonlight often, as I now see you; except that I
never held her in my arms; it stood between the little grated window
and the door. But, you understand that that was not the child I am
speaking of?”
“The figure was not; the—the—image; the fancy?”
“No. That was another thing. It stood before my disturbed sense
of sight, but it never moved. The phantom that my mind pursued, was
another and more real child. Of her outward appearance I know no
more than that she was like her mother. The other had that likeness
too—as you have—but was not the same. Can you follow me, Lucie?
Hardly, I think? I doubt you must have been a solitary prisoner to
understand these perplexed distinctions.”
His collected and calm manner could not prevent her blood from
running cold, as he thus tried to anatomise his old condition.
“In that more peaceful state, I have imagined her, in the moonlight,
165
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
coming to me and taking me out to show me that the home of her
married life was full of her loving remembrance of her lost father. My
picture was in her room, and I was in her prayers. Her life was active,
cheerful, useful; but my poor history pervaded it all.”
“I was that child, my father, I was not half so good, but in my love
that was I.”
“And she showed me her children,” said the Doctor of Beauvais,
“and they had heard of me, and had been taught to pity me. When they
passed a prison of the State, they kept far from its frowning walls, and
looked up at its bars, and spoke in whispers. She could never deliver
me; I imagined that she always brought me back after showing me such
things. But then, blessed with the relief of tears, I fell upon my knees,
and blessed her.”
“I am that child, I hope, my father. O my dear, my dear, will you
bless me as fervently to-morrow?”
“Lucie, I recall these old troubles in the reason that I have to-night
for loving you better than words can tell, and thanking God for my
great happiness. My thoughts, when they were wildest, never rose near
the happiness that I have known with you, and that we have before us.”
He embraced her, solemnly commended her to Heaven, and humbly
thanked Heaven for having bestowed her on him. By-and-bye, they
went into the house.
There was no one bidden to the marriage but Mr. Lorry; there was
even to be no bridesmaid but the gaunt Miss Pross. The marriage was
to make no change in their place of residence; they had been able to
extend it, by taking to themselves the upper rooms formerly belonging
to the apocryphal invisible lodger, and they desired nothing more.
Doctor Manette was very cheerful at the little supper. They were
only three at table, and Miss Pross made the third. He regretted that
Charles was not there; was more than half disposed to object to the
loving little plot that kept him away; and drank to him affectionately.
So, the time came for him to bid Lucie good night, and they separated. But, in the stillness of the third hour of the morning, Lucie came
downstairs again, and stole into his room; not free from unshaped fears,
beforehand.
All things, however, were in their places; all was quiet; and he lay
asleep, his white hair picturesque on the untroubled pillow, and his
hands lying quiet on the coverlet. She put her needless candle in the
shadow at a distance, crept up to his bed, and put her lips to his; then,
166
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
leaned over him, and looked at him.
Into his handsome face, the bitter waters of captivity had worn; but,
he covered up their tracks with a determination so strong, that he held
the mastery of them even in his sleep. A more remarkable face in its
quiet, resolute, and guarded struggle with an unseen assailant, was not
to be beheld in all the wide dominions of sleep, that night.
She timidly laid her hand on his dear breast, and put up a prayer
that she might ever be as true to him as her love aspired to be, and as
his sorrows deserved. Then, she withdrew her hand, and kissed his lips
once more, and went away. So, the sunrise came, and the shadows of
the leaves of the plane-tree moved upon his face, as softly as her lips
had moved in praying for him.
Chapter 18
Nine Days
The marriage-day was shining brightly, and they were ready outside the
closed door of the Doctor’s room, where he was speaking with Charles
Darnay. They were ready to go to church; the beautiful bride, Mr. Lorry,
and Miss Pross—to whom the event, through a gradual process of reconcilement to the inevitable, would have been one of absolute bliss, but
for the yet lingering consideration that her brother Solomon should have
been the bridegroom.
“And so,” said Mr. Lorry, who could not sufficiently admire the
bride, and who had been moving round her to take in every point of
her quiet, pretty dress; “and so it was for this, my sweet Lucie, that I
brought you across the Channel, such a baby’ Lord bless me’ How little
I thought what I was doing! How lightly I valued the obligation I was
conferring on my friend Mr. Charles!”
“You didn’t mean it,” remarked the matter-of-fact Miss Pross, “and
therefore how could you know it? Nonsense!”
“Really? Well; but don’t cry,” said the gentle Mr. Lorry.
“I am not crying,” said Miss Pross; “you are.”
“I, my Pross?” (By this time, Mr. Lorry dared to be pleasant with
her, on occasion.)
“You were, just now; I saw you do it, and I don’t wonder at it. Such
a present of plate as you have made ’em, is enough to bring tears into
167
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
anybody’s eyes. There’s not a fork or a spoon in the collection,” said
Miss Pross, “that I didn’t cry over, last night after the box came, till I
couldn’t see it.”
“I am highly gratified,” said Mr. Lorry, “though, upon my honour,
I had no intention of rendering those trifling articles of remembrance
invisible to any one. Dear me! This is an occasion that makes a man
speculate on all he has lost. Dear, dear, dear! To think that there might
have been a Mrs. Lorry, any time these fifty years almost!”
“Not at all!” From Miss Pross.
“You think there never might have been a Mrs. Lorry?” asked the
gentleman of that name.
“Pooh!” rejoined Miss Pross; “you were a bachelor in your cradle.”
“Well!” observed Mr. Lorry, beamingly adjusting his little wig, “that
seems probable, too.”
“And you were cut out for a bachelor,” pursued Miss Pross, “before
you were put in your cradle.”
“Then, I think,” said Mr. Lorry, “that I was very unhandsomely
dealt with, and that I ought to have had a voice in the selection of my
pattern. Enough! Now, my dear Lucie,” drawing his arm soothingly
round her waist, “I hear them moving in the next room, and Miss Pross
and I, as two formal folks of business, are anxious not to lose the final
opportunity of saying something to you that you wish to hear. You
leave your good father, my dear, in hands as earnest and as loving as
your own; he shall be taken every conceivable care of; during the next
fortnight, while you are in Warwickshire and thereabouts, even Tellson’s
shall go to the wall (comparatively speaking) before him. And when, at
the fortnight’s end, he comes to join you and your beloved husband,
on your other fortnight’s trip in Wales, you shall say that we have sent
him to you in the best health and in the happiest frame. Now, I hear
Somebody’s step coming to the door. Let me kiss my dear girl with an
old-fashioned bachelor blessing, before Somebody comes to claim his
own.”
For a moment, he held the fair face from him to look at the wellremembered expression on the forehead, and then laid the bright golden
hair against his little brown wig, with a genuine tenderness and delicacy
which, if such things be old-fashioned, were as old as Adam.
The door of the Doctor’s room opened, and he came out with
Charles Darnay. He was so deadly pale—which had not been the case
when they went in together—that no vestige of colour was to be seen in
168
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
his face. But, in the composure of his manner he was unaltered, except
that to the shrewd glance of Mr. Lorry it disclosed some shadowy indication that the old air of avoidance and dread had lately passed over
him, like a cold wind.
He gave his arm to his daughter, and took her down-stairs to the
chariot which Mr. Lorry had hired in honour of the day. The rest followed in another carriage, and soon, in a neighbouring church, where
no strange eyes looked on, Charles Darnay and Lucie Manette were
happily married.
Besides the glancing tears that shone among the smiles of the little
group when it was done, some diamonds, very bright and sparkling,
glanced on the bride’s hand, which were newly released from the dark
obscurity of one of Mr. Lorry’s pockets. They returned home to breakfast, and all went well, and in due course the golden hair that had mingled with the poor shoemaker’s white locks in the Paris garret, were
mingled with them again in the morning sunlight, on the threshold of
the door at parting.
It was a hard parting, though it was not for long. But her father
cheered her, and said at last, gently disengaging himself from her enfolding arms, “Take her, Charles! She is yours!”
And her agitated hand waved to them from a chaise window, and
she was gone.
The corner being out of the way of the idle and curious, and the
preparations having been very simple and few, the Doctor, Mr. Lorry,
and Miss Pross, were left quite alone. It was when they turned into
the welcome shade of the cool old hall, that Mr. Lorry observed a great
change to have come over the Doctor; as if the golden arm uplifted there,
had struck him a poisoned blow.
He had naturally repressed much, and some revulsion might have
been expected in him when the occasion for repression was gone. But,
it was the old scared lost look that troubled Mr. Lorry; and through
his absent manner of clasping his head and drearily wandering away
into his own room when they got up-stairs, Mr. Lorry was reminded of
Defarge the wine-shop keeper, and the starlight ride.
“I think,” he whispered to Miss Pross, after anxious consideration,
“I think we had best not speak to him just now, or at all disturb him.
I must look in at Tellson’s; so I will go there at once and come back
presently. Then, we will take him a ride into the country, and dine there,
and all will be well.”
169
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
It was easier for Mr. Lorry to look in at Tellson’s, than to look out
of Tellson’s. He was detained two hours. When he came back, he ascended the old staircase alone, having asked no question of the servant;
going thus into the Doctor’s rooms, he was stopped by a low sound of
knocking.
“Good God!” he said, with a start. “What’s that?”
Miss Pross, with a terrified face, was at his ear. “O me, O me! All is
lost!” cried she, wringing her hands. “What is to be told to Ladybird?
He doesn’t know me, and is making shoes!”
Mr. Lorry said what he could to calm her, and went himself into the
Doctor’s room. The bench was turned towards the light, as it had been
when he had seen the shoemaker at his work before, and his head was
bent down, and he was very busy.
“Doctor Manette. My dear friend, Doctor Manette!”
The Doctor looked at him for a moment—half inquiringly, half as if
he were angry at being spoken to—and bent over his work again.
He had laid aside his coat and waistcoat; his shirt was open at the
throat, as it used to be when he did that work; and even the old haggard, faded surface of face had come back to him. He worked hard—
impatiently—as if in some sense of having been interrupted.
Mr. Lorry glanced at the work in his hand, and observed that it was
a shoe of the old size and shape. He took up another that was lying by
him, and asked what it was.
“A young lady’s walking shoe,” he muttered, without looking up.
“It ought to have been finished long ago. Let it be.”
“But, Doctor Manette. Look at me!”
He obeyed, in the old mechanically submissive manner, without
pausing in his work.
“You know me, my dear friend? Think again. This is not your
proper occupation. Think, dear friend!”
Nothing would induce him to speak more. He looked up, for an
instant at a time, when he was requested to do so; but, no persuasion
would extract a word from him. He worked, and worked, and worked,
in silence, and words fell on him as they would have fallen on an echoless wall, or on the air. The only ray of hope that Mr. Lorry could discover, was, that he sometimes furtively looked up without being asked.
In that, there seemed a faint expression of curiosity or perplexity—as
though he were trying to reconcile some doubts in his mind.
Two things at once impressed themselves on Mr. Lorry, as important
170
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
above all others; the first, that this must be kept secret from Lucie; the
second, that it must be kept secret from all who knew him. In conjunction with Miss Pross, he took immediate steps towards the latter
precaution, by giving out that the Doctor was not well, and required
a few days of complete rest. In aid of the kind deception to be practised on his daughter, Miss Pross was to write, describing his having
been called away professionally, and referring to an imaginary letter of
two or three hurried lines in his own hand, represented to have been
addressed to her by the same post.
These measures, advisable to be taken in any case, Mr. Lorry took in
the hope of his coming to himself. If that should happen soon, he kept
another course in reserve; which was, to have a certain opinion that he
thought the best, on the Doctor’s case.
In the hope of his recovery, and of resort to this third course being
thereby rendered practicable, Mr. Lorry resolved to watch him attentively, with as little appearance as possible of doing so. He therefore
made arrangements to absent himself from Tellson’s for the first time in
his life, and took his post by the window in the same room.
He was not long in discovering that it was worse than useless to
speak to him, since, on being pressed, he became worried. He abandoned that attempt on the first day, and resolved merely to keep himself
always before him, as a silent protest against the delusion into which he
had fallen, or was falling. He remained, therefore, in his seat near the
window, reading and writing, and expressing in as many pleasant and
natural ways as he could think of, that it was a free place.
Doctor Manette took what was given him to eat and drink, and
worked on, that first day, until it was too dark to see—worked on, half
an hour after Mr. Lorry could not have seen, for his life, to read or
write. When he put his tools aside as useless, until morning, Mr. Lorry
rose and said to him:
“Will you go out?”
He looked down at the floor on either side of him in the old manner,
looked up in the old manner, and repeated in the old low voice:
“Out?”
“Yes; for a walk with me. Why not?”
He made no effort to say why not, and said not a word more. But,
Mr. Lorry thought he saw, as he leaned forward on his bench in the
dusk, with his elbows on his knees and his head in his hands, that he
was in some misty way asking himself, “Why not?” The sagacity of the
171
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
man of business perceived an advantage here, and determined to hold
it.
Miss Pross and he divided the night into two watches, and observed
him at intervals from the adjoining room. He paced up and down for a
long time before he lay down; but, when he did finally lay himself down,
he fell asleep. In the morning, he was up betimes, and went straight to
his bench and to work.
On this second day, Mr. Lorry saluted him cheerfully by his name,
and spoke to him on topics that had been of late familiar to them. He returned no reply, but it was evident that he heard what was said, and that
he thought about it, however confusedly. This encouraged Mr. Lorry to
have Miss Pross in with her work, several times during the day; at those
times, they quietly spoke of Lucie, and of her father then present, precisely in the usual manner, and as if there were nothing amiss. This was
done without any demonstrative accompaniment, not long enough, or
often enough to harass him; and it lightened Mr. Lorry’s friendly heart
to believe that he looked up oftener, and that he appeared to be stirred
by some perception of inconsistencies surrounding him.
When it fell dark again, Mr. Lorry asked him as before:
“Dear Doctor, will you go out?”
As before, he repeated, “Out?”
“Yes; for a walk with me. Why not?”
This time, Mr. Lorry feigned to go out when he could extract no
answer from him, and, after remaining absent for an hour, returned. In
the meanwhile, the Doctor had removed to the seat in the window, and
had sat there looking down at the plane-tree; but, on Mr. Lorry’s return,
be slipped away to his bench.
The time went very slowly on, and Mr. Lorry’s hope darkened, and
his heart grew heavier again, and grew yet heavier and heavier every
day. The third day came and went, the fourth, the fifth. Five days, six
days, seven days, eight days, nine days.
With a hope ever darkening, and with a heart always growing heavier and heavier, Mr. Lorry passed through this anxious time. The secret
was well kept, and Lucie was unconscious and happy; but he could not
fail to observe that the shoemaker, whose hand had been a little out
at first, was growing dreadfully skilful, and that he had never been so
intent on his work, and that his hands had never been so nimble and
expert, as in the dusk of the ninth evening.
172
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
Chapter 19
An Opinion
Worn out by anxious watching, Mr. Lorry fell asleep at his post. On the
tenth morning of his suspense, he was startled by the shining of the sun
into the room where a heavy slumber had overtaken him when it was
dark night.
He rubbed his eyes and roused himself; but he doubted, when he
had done so, whether he was not still asleep. For, going to the door
of the Doctor’s room and looking in, he perceived that the shoemaker’s
bench and tools were put aside again, and that the Doctor himself sat
reading at the window. He was in his usual morning dress, and his face
(which Mr. Lorry could distinctly see), though still very pale, was calmly
studious and attentive.
Even when he had satisfied himself that he was awake, Mr. Lorry felt
giddily uncertain for some few moments whether the late shoemaking
might not be a disturbed dream of his own; for, did not his eyes show
him his friend before him in his accustomed clothing and aspect, and
employed as usual; and was there any sign within their range, that the
change of which he had so strong an impression had actually happened?
It was but the inquiry of his first confusion and astonishment, the
answer being obvious. If the impression were not produced by a real
corresponding and sufficient cause, how came he, Jarvis Lorry, there?
How came he to have fallen asleep, in his clothes, on the sofa in Doctor
Manette’s consulting-room, and to be debating these points outside the
Doctor’s bedroom door in the early morning?
Within a few minutes, Miss Pross stood whispering at his side. If
he had had any particle of doubt left, her talk would of necessity have
resolved it; but he was by that time clear-headed, and had none. He advised that they should let the time go by until the regular breakfast-hour,
and should then meet the Doctor as if nothing unusual had occurred. If
he appeared to be in his customary state of mind, Mr. Lorry would then
cautiously proceed to seek direction and guidance from the opinion he
had been, in his anxiety, so anxious to obtain.
Miss Pross, submitting herself to his judgment, the scheme was
worked out with care. Having abundance of time for his usual methodical toilette, Mr. Lorry presented himself at the breakfast-hour in
173
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
his usual white linen, and with his usual neat leg. The Doctor was summoned in the usual way, and came to breakfast.
So far as it was possible to comprehend him without overstepping
those delicate and gradual approaches which Mr. Lorry felt to be the
only safe advance, he at first supposed that his daughter’s marriage had
taken place yesterday. An incidental allusion, purposely thrown out,
to the day of the week, and the day of the month, set him thinking and
counting, and evidently made him uneasy. In all other respects, however,
he was so composedly himself, that Mr. Lorry determined to have the
aid he sought. And that aid was his own.
Therefore, when the breakfast was done and cleared away, and he
and the Doctor were left together, Mr. Lorry said, feelingly:
“My dear Manette, I am anxious to have your opinion, in confidence, on a very curious case in which I am deeply interested; that is to
say, it is very curious to me; perhaps, to your better information it may
be less so.”
Glancing at his hands, which were discoloured by his late work,
the Doctor looked troubled, and listened attentively. He had already
glanced at his hands more than once.
“Doctor Manette,” said Mr. Lorry, touching him affectionately on
the arm, “the case is the case of a particularly dear friend of mine. Pray
give your mind to it, and advise me well for his sake—and above all, for
his daughter’s—his daughter’s, my dear Manette.”
“If I understand,” said the Doctor, in a subdued tone, “some mental
shock—?”
“Yes!”
“Be explicit,” said the Doctor. “Spare no detail.”
Mr. Lorry saw that they understood one another, and proceeded.
“My dear Manette, it is the case of an old and a prolonged shock, of
great acuteness and severity to the affections, the feelings, the—the—as
you express it—the mind. The mind. It is the case of a shock under
which the sufferer was borne down, one cannot say for how long, because I believe he cannot calculate the time himself, and there are no
other means of getting at it. It is the case of a shock from which the
sufferer recovered, by a process that he cannot trace himself—as I once
heard him publicly relate in a striking manner. It is the case of a shock
from which he has recovered, so completely, as to be a highly intelligent man, capable of close application of mind, and great exertion of
body, and of constantly making fresh additions to his stock of knowl174
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
edge, which was already very large. But, unfortunately, there has been,”
he paused and took a deep breath—“a slight relapse.”
The Doctor, in a low voice, asked, “Of how long duration?”
“Nine days and nights.”
“How did it show itself? I infer,” glancing at his hands again, “in
the resumption of some old pursuit connected with the shock?”
“That is the fact.”
“Now, did you ever see him,” asked the Doctor, distinctly and collectedly, though in the same low voice, “engaged in that pursuit originally?”
“Once.”
“And when the relapse fell on him, was he in most respects—or in
all respects—as he was then?”
“I think in all respects.”
“You spoke of his daughter. Does his daughter know of the relapse?”
“No. It has been kept from her, and I hope will always be kept from
her. It is known only to myself, and to one other who may be trusted.”
The Doctor grasped his hand, and murmured, “That was very kind.
That was very thoughtful!” Mr. Lorry grasped his hand in return, and
neither of the two spoke for a little while.
“Now, my dear Manette,” said Mr. Lorry, at length, in his most
considerate and most affectionate way, “I am a mere man of business,
and unfit to cope with such intricate and difficult matters. I do not
possess the kind of information necessary; I do not possess the kind of
intelligence; I want guiding. There is no man in this world on whom
I could so rely for right guidance, as on you. Tell me, how does this
relapse come about? Is there danger of another? Could a repetition of
it be prevented? How should a repetition of it be treated? How does
it come about at all? What can I do for my friend? No man ever can
have been more desirous in his heart to serve a friend, than I am to serve
mine, if I knew how.
But I don’t know how to originate, in such a case. If your sagacity,
knowledge, and experience, could put me on the right track, I might
be able to do so much; unenlightened and undirected, I can do so little.
Pray discuss it with me; pray enable me to see it a little more clearly,
and teach me how to be a little more useful.“
Doctor Manette sat meditating after these earnest words were spoken, and Mr. Lorry did not press him.
175
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
“I think it probable,” said the Doctor, breaking silence with an effort, “that the relapse you have described, my dear friend, was not quite
unforeseen by its subject.”
“Was it dreaded by him?” Mr. Lorry ventured to ask.
“Very much.” He said it with an involuntary shudder.
“You have no idea how such an apprehension weighs on the sufferer’s mind, and how difficult—how almost impossible—it is, for him
to force himself to utter a word upon the topic that oppresses him.”
“Would he,” asked Mr. Lorry, “be sensibly relieved if he could prevail upon himself to impart that secret brooding to any one, when it is
on him?”
“I think so. But it is, as I have told you, next to impossible. I even
believe it—in some cases—to be quite impossible.”
“Now,” said Mr. Lorry, gently laying his hand on the Doctor’s arm
again, after a short silence on both sides, “to what would you refer this
attack?”
“I believe,” returned Doctor Manette, “that there had been a strong
and extraordinary revival of the train of thought and remembrance that
was the first cause of the malady. Some intense associations of a most
distressing nature were vividly recalled, I think. It is probable that there
had long been a dread lurking in his mind, that those associations would
be recalled—say, under certain circumstances—say, on a particular occasion. He tried to prepare himself in vain; perhaps the effort to prepare
himself made him less able to bear it.”
“Would he remember what took place in the relapse?” asked Mr.
Lorry, with natural hesitation.
The Doctor looked desolately round the room, shook his head, and
answered, in a low voice, “Not at all.”
“Now, as to the future,” hinted Mr. Lorry.
“As to the future,” said the Doctor, recovering firmness, “I should
have great hope. As it pleased Heaven in its mercy to restore him so
soon, I should have great hope. He, yielding under the pressure of a
complicated something, long dreaded and long vaguely foreseen and
contended against, and recovering after the cloud had burst and passed,
I should hope that the worst was over.”
“Well, well! That’s good comfort. I am thankful!” said Mr. Lorry.
“I am thankful!” repeated the Doctor, bending his head with reverence.
“There are two other points,” said Mr. Lorry, “on which I am anx176
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
ious to be instructed. I may go on?”
“You cannot do your friend a better service.” The Doctor gave him
his hand.
“To the first, then. He is of a studious habit, and unusually energetic;
he applies himself with great ardour to the acquisition of professional
knowledge, to the conducting of experiments, to many things. Now,
does he do too much?”
“I think not. It may be the character of his mind, to be always in
singular need of occupation. That may be, in part, natural to it; in part,
the result of affliction. The less it was occupied with healthy things, the
more it would be in danger of turning in the unhealthy direction. He
may have observed himself, and made the discovery.”
“You are sure that he is not under too great a strain?”
“I think I am quite sure of it.”
“My dear Manette, if he were overworked now—”
“My dear Lorry, I doubt if that could easily be. There has been a
violent stress in one direction, and it needs a counterweight.”
“Excuse me, as a persistent man of business. Assuming for a moment, that he was overworked; it would show itself in some renewal of
this disorder?”
“I do not think so. I do not think,” said Doctor Manette with the
firmness of self-conviction, “that anything but the one train of association would renew it. I think that, henceforth, nothing but some extraordinary jarring of that chord could renew it. After what has happened,
and after his recovery, I find it difficult to imagine any such violent
sounding of that string again. I trust, and I almost believe, that the
circumstances likely to renew it are exhausted.”
He spoke with the diffidence of a man who knew how slight a thing
would overset the delicate organisation of the mind, and yet with the
confidence of a man who had slowly won his assurance out of personal
endurance and distress. It was not for his friend to abate that confidence.
He professed himself more relieved and encouraged than he really was,
and approached his second and last point. He felt it to be the most
difficult of all; but, remembering his old Sunday morning conversation
with Miss Pross, and remembering what he had seen in the last nine
days, he knew that he must face it.
“The occupation resumed under the influence of this passing affliction so happily recovered from,” said Mr. Lorry, clearing his throat, “we
will call—Blacksmith’s work, Blacksmith’s work. We will say, to put a
177
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
case and for the sake of illustration, that he had been used, in his bad
time, to work at a little forge. We will say that he was unexpectedly
found at his forge again. Is it not a pity that he should keep it by him?”
The Doctor shaded his forehead with his hand, and beat his foot
nervously on the ground.
“He has always kept it by him,” said Mr. Lorry, with an anxious
look at his friend. “Now, would it not be better that he should let it
go?”
Still, the Doctor, with shaded forehead, beat his foot nervously on
the ground.
“You do not find it easy to advise me?” said Mr. Lorry. “I quite
understand it to be a nice question. And yet I think—” And there he
shook his head, and stopped.
“You see,” said Doctor Manette, turning to him after an uneasy
pause, “it is very hard to explain, consistently, the innermost workings
of this poor man’s mind. He once yearned so frightfully for that occupation, and it was so welcome when it came; no doubt it relieved his pain
so much, by substituting the perplexity of the fingers for the perplexity
of the brain, and by substituting, as he became more practised, the ingenuity of the hands, for the ingenuity of the mental torture; that he has
never been able to bear the thought of putting it quite out of his reach.
Even now, when I believe he is more hopeful of himself than he has ever
been, and even speaks of himself with a kind of confidence, the idea that
he might need that old employment, and not find it, gives him a sudden
sense of terror, like that which one may fancy strikes to the heart of a
lost child.”
He looked like his illustration, as he raised his eyes to Mr. Lorry’s
face.
“But may not—mind! I ask for information, as a plodding man of
business who only deals with such material objects as guineas, shillings,
and bank-notes—may not the retention of the thing involve the retention of the idea? If the thing were gone, my dear Manette, might not
the fear go with it? In short, is it not a concession to the misgiving, to
keep the forge?”
There was another silence.
“You see, too,” said the Doctor, tremulously, “it is such an old companion.”
“I would not keep it,” said Mr. Lorry, shaking his head; for he
gained in firmness as he saw the Doctor disquieted. “I would recom178
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
mend him to sacrifice it. I only want your authority. I am sure it does
no good. Come! Give me your authority, like a dear good man. For his
daughter’s sake, my dear Manette!”
Very strange to see what a struggle there was within him!
“In her name, then, let it be done; I sanction it. But, I would not
take it away while he was present. Let it be removed when he is not
there; let him miss his old companion after an absence.”
Mr. Lorry readily engaged for that, and the conference was ended.
They passed the day in the country, and the Doctor was quite restored.
On the three following days he remained perfectly well, and on the fourteenth day he went away to join Lucie and her husband. The precaution
that had been taken to account for his silence, Mr. Lorry had previously
explained to him, and he had written to Lucie in accordance with it, and
she had no suspicions.
On the night of the day on which he left the house, Mr. Lorry went
into his room with a chopper, saw, chisel, and hammer, attended by
Miss Pross carrying a light. There, with closed doors, and in a mysterious and guilty manner, Mr. Lorry hacked the shoemaker’s bench to
pieces, while Miss Pross held the candle as if she were assisting at a
murder—for which, indeed, in her grimness, she was no unsuitable figure. The burning of the body (previously reduced to pieces convenient
for the purpose) was commenced without delay in the kitchen fire; and
the tools, shoes, and leather, were buried in the garden. So wicked do
destruction and secrecy appear to honest minds, that Mr. Lorry and
Miss Pross, while engaged in the commission of their deed and in the
removal of its traces, almost felt, and almost looked, like accomplices
in a horrible crime.
Chapter 20
A Plea
When the newly-married pair came home, the first person who appeared,
to offer his congratulations, was Sydney Carton. They had not been at
home many hours, when he presented himself. He was not improved
in habits, or in looks, or in manner; but there was a certain rugged
air of fidelity about him, which was new to the observation of Charles
Darnay.
179
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
He watched his opportunity of taking Darnay aside into a window,
and of speaking to him when no one overheard.
“Mr. Darnay,” said Carton, “I wish we might be friends.”
“We are already friends, I hope.”
“You are good enough to say so, as a fashion of speech; but, I don’t
mean any fashion of speech. Indeed, when I say I wish we might be
friends, I scarcely mean quite that, either.”
Charles Darnay—as was natural—asked him, in all good-humour
and good-fellowship, what he did mean?
“Upon my life,” said Carton, smiling, “I find that easier to comprehend in my own mind, than to convey to yours. However, let me
try. You remember a certain famous occasion when I was more drunk
than—than usual?”
“I remember a certain famous occasion when you forced me to confess that you had been drinking.”
“I remember it too. The curse of those occasions is heavy upon me,
for I always remember them. I hope it may be taken into account one
day, when all days are at an end for me! Don’t be alarmed; I am not
going to preach.”
“I am not at all alarmed. Earnestness in you, is anything but alarming to me.”
“Ah!” said Carton, with a careless wave of his hand, as if he waved
that away. “On the drunken occasion in question (one of a large number,
as you know), I was insufferable about liking you, and not liking you. I
wish you would forget it.”
“I forgot it long ago.”
“Fashion of speech again! But, Mr. Darnay, oblivion is not so easy
to me, as you represent it to be to you. I have by no means forgotten it,
and a light answer does not help me to forget it.”
“If it was a light answer,” returned Darnay, “I beg your forgiveness
for it. I had no other object than to turn a slight thing, which, to my
surprise, seems to trouble you too much, aside. I declare to you, on the
faith of a gentleman, that I have long dismissed it from my mind. Good
Heaven, what was there to dismiss! Have I had nothing more important
to remember, in the great service you rendered me that day?”
“As to the great service,” said Carton, “I am bound to avow to you,
when you speak of it in that way, that it was mere professional claptrap,
I don’t know that I cared what became of you, when I rendered it.—
Mind! I say when I rendered it; I am speaking of the past.”
180
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
“You make light of the obligation,” returned Darnay, “but I will not
quarrel with your light answer.”
“Genuine truth, Mr. Darnay, trust me! I have gone aside from my
purpose; I was speaking about our being friends. Now, you know me;
you know I am incapable of all the higher and better flights of men. If
you doubt it, ask Stryver, and he’ll tell you so.”
“I prefer to form my own opinion, without the aid of his.”
“Well! At any rate you know me as a dissolute dog, who has never
done any good, and never will.”
“I don’t know that you ‘never will.’ ”
“But I do, and you must take my word for it. Well! If you could
endure to have such a worthless fellow, and a fellow of such indifferent
reputation, coming and going at odd times, I should ask that I might
be permitted to come and go as a privileged person here; that I might
be regarded as an useless (and I would add, if it were not for the resemblance I detected between you and me, an unornamental) piece of
furniture, tolerated for its old service, and taken no notice of. I doubt
if I should abuse the permission. It is a hundred to one if I should avail
myself of it four times in a year. It would satisfy me, I dare say, to know
that I had it.”
“Will you try?”
“That is another way of saying that I am placed on the footing I
have indicated. I thank you, Darnay. I may use that freedom with your
name?”
“I think so, Carton, by this time.”
They shook hands upon it, and Sydney turned away. Within a
minute afterwards, he was, to all outward appearance, as unsubstantial
as ever.
When he was gone, and in the course of an evening passed with Miss
Pross, the Doctor, and Mr. Lorry, Charles Darnay made some mention
of this conversation in general terms, and spoke of Sydney Carton as a
problem of carelessness and recklessness. He spoke of him, in short, not
bitterly or meaning to bear hard upon him, but as anybody might who
saw him as he showed himself.
He had no idea that this could dwell in the thoughts of his fair young
wife; but, when he afterwards joined her in their own rooms, he found
her waiting for him with the old pretty lifting of the forehead strongly
marked.
“We are thoughtful to-night!” said Darnay, drawing his arm about
181
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
her.
“Yes, dearest Charles,” with her hands on his breast, and the inquiring and attentive expression fixed upon him; “we are rather thoughtful
to-night, for we have something on our mind to-night.”
“What is it, my Lucie?”
“Will you promise not to press one question on me, if I beg you not
to ask it?”
“Will I promise? What will I not promise to my Love?”
What, indeed, with his hand putting aside the golden hair from the
cheek, and his other hand against the heart that beat for him!
“I think, Charles, poor Mr. Carton deserves more consideration and
respect than you expressed for him to-night.”
“Indeed, my own? Why so?”
“That is what you are not to ask me. But I think—I know—he
does.”
“If you know it, it is enough. What would you have me do, my
Life?”
“I would ask you, dearest, to be very generous with him always, and
very lenient on his faults when he is not by. I would ask you to believe
that he has a heart he very, very seldom reveals, and that there are deep
wounds in it. My dear, I have seen it bleeding.”
“It is a painful reflection to me,” said Charles Darnay, quite astounded, “that I should have done him any wrong. I never thought
this of him.”
“My husband, it is so. I fear he is not to be reclaimed; there is
scarcely a hope that anything in his character or fortunes is reparable
now. But, I am sure that he is capable of good things, gentle things, even
magnanimous things.”
She looked so beautiful in the purity of her faith in this lost man,
that her husband could have looked at her as she was for hours.
“And, O my dearest Love!” she urged, clinging nearer to him, laying
her head upon his breast, and raising her eyes to his, “remember how
strong we are in our happiness, and how weak he is in his misery!”
The supplication touched him home. “I will always remember it,
dear Heart! I will remember it as long as I live.”
He bent over the golden head, and put the rosy lips to his, and
folded her in his arms. If one forlorn wanderer then pacing the dark
streets, could have heard her innocent disclosure, and could have seen
the drops of pity kissed away by her husband from the soft blue eyes
182
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
so loving of that husband, he might have cried to the night—and the
words would not have parted from his lips for the first time—
“God bless her for her sweet compassion!”
Chapter 21
Echoing Footsteps
A wonderful corner for echoes, it has been remarked, that corner where
the Doctor lived. Ever busily winding the golden thread which bound
her husband, and her father, and herself, and her old directress and
companion, in a life of quiet bliss, Lucie sat in the still house in the
tranquilly resounding corner, listening to the echoing footsteps of years.
At first, there were times, though she was a perfectly happy young
wife, when her work would slowly fall from her hands, and her eyes
would be dimmed. For, there was something coming in the echoes,
something light, afar off, and scarcely audible yet, that stirred her heart
too much. Fluttering hopes and doubts—hopes, of a love as yet unknown to her: doubts, of her remaining upon earth, to enjoy that new
delight—divided her breast. Among the echoes then, there would arise
the sound of footsteps at her own early grave; and thoughts of the husband who would be left so desolate, and who would mourn for her so
much, swelled to her eyes, and broke like waves.
That time passed, and her little Lucie lay on her bosom. Then,
among the advancing echoes, there was the tread of her tiny feet and the
sound of her prattling words. Let greater echoes resound as they would,
the young mother at the cradle side could always hear those coming.
They came, and the shady house was sunny with a child’s laugh, and
the Divine friend of children, to whom in her trouble she had confided
hers, seemed to take her child in his arms, as He took the child of old,
and made it a sacred joy to her.
Ever busily winding the golden thread that bound them all together,
weaving the service of her happy influence through the tissue of all their
lives, and making it predominate nowhere, Lucie heard in the echoes of
years none but friendly and soothing sounds. Her husband’s step was
strong and prosperous among them; her father’s firm and equal. Lo,
Miss Pross, in harness of string, awakening the echoes, as an unruly
183
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
charger, whip-corrected, snorting and pawing the earth under the planetree in the garden!
Even when there were sounds of sorrow among the rest, they were
not harsh nor cruel. Even when golden hair, like her own, lay in a halo
on a pillow round the worn face of a little boy, and he said, with a
radiant smile, “Dear papa and mamma, I am very sorry to leave you
both, and to leave my pretty sister; but I am called, and I must go!”
those were not tears all of agony that wetted his young mother’s cheek,
as the spirit departed from her embrace that had been entrusted to it.
Suffer them and forbid them not. They see my Father’s face. O Father,
blessed words!
Thus, the rustling of an Angel’s wings got blended with the other
echoes, and they were not wholly of earth, but had in them that breath
of Heaven. Sighs of the winds that blew over a little garden-tomb
were mingled with them also, and both were audible to Lucie, in a
hushed murmur—like the breathing of a summer sea asleep upon a
sandy shore—as the little Lucie, comically studious at the task of the
morning, or dressing a doll at her mother’s footstool, chattered in the
tongues of the Two Cities that were blended in her life.
The Echoes rarely answered to the actual tread of Sydney Carton.
Some half-dozen times a year, at most, he claimed his privilege of coming in uninvited, and would sit among them through the evening, as he
had once done often. He never came there heated with wine. And one
other thing regarding him was whispered in the echoes, which has been
whispered by all true echoes for ages and ages.
No man ever really loved a woman, lost her, and knew her with
a blameless though an unchanged mind, when she was a wife and a
mother, but her children had a strange sympathy with him—an instinctive delicacy of pity for him. What fine hidden sensibilities are touched
in such a case, no echoes tell; but it is so, and it was so here. Carton was
the first stranger to whom little Lucie held out her chubby arms, and he
kept his place with her as she grew. The little boy had spoken of him,
almost at the last. “Poor Carton! Kiss him for me!”
Mr. Stryver shouldered his way through the law, like some great
engine forcing itself through turbid water, and dragged his useful friend
in his wake, like a boat towed astern. As the boat so favoured is usually
in a rough plight, and mostly under water, so, Sydney had a swamped
life of it. But, easy and strong custom, unhappily so much easier and
stronger in him than any stimulating sense of desert or disgrace, made
184
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
it the life he was to lead; and he no more thought of emerging from his
state of lion’s jackal, than any real jackal may be supposed to think of
rising to be a lion. Stryver was rich; had married a florid widow with
property and three boys, who had nothing particularly shining about
them but the straight hair of their dumpling heads.
These three young gentlemen, Mr. Stryver, exuding patronage of the
most offensive quality from every pore, had walked before him like
three sheep to the quiet corner in Soho, and had offered as pupils to
Lucie’s husband: delicately saying “Halloa! here are three lumps of
bread-and-cheese towards your matrimonial picnic, Darnay!” The polite rejection of the three lumps of bread-and-cheese had quite bloated
Mr. Stryver with indignation, which he afterwards turned to account
in the training of the young gentlemen, by directing them to beware of
the pride of Beggars, like that tutor-fellow. He was also in the habit of
declaiming to Mrs. Stryver, over his full-bodied wine, on the arts Mrs.
Darnay had once put in practice to “catch” him, and on the diamondcut-diamond arts in himself, madam, which had rendered him “not to
be caught.” Some of his King’s Bench familiars, who were occasionally
parties to the full-bodied wine and the lie, excused him for the latter by
saying that he had told it so often, that he believed it himself—which is
surely such an incorrigible aggravation of an originally bad offence, as
to justify any such offender’s being carried off to some suitably retired
spot, and there hanged out of the way.
These were among the echoes to which Lucie, sometimes pensive,
sometimes amused and laughing, listened in the echoing corner, until
her little daughter was six years old. How near to her heart the echoes
of her child’s tread came, and those of her own dear father’s, always
active and self-possessed, and those of her dear husband’s, need not
be told. Nor, how the lightest echo of their united home, directed by
herself with such a wise and elegant thrift that it was more abundant
than any waste, was music to her. Nor, how there were echoes all about
her, sweet in her ears, of the many times her father had told her that he
found her more devoted to him married (if that could be) than single,
and of the many times her husband had said to her that no cares and
duties seemed to divide her love for him or her help to him, and asked
her “What is the magic secret, my darling, of your being everything to
all of us, as if there were only one of us, yet never seeming to be hurried,
or to have too much to do?”
But, there were other echoes, from a distance, that rumbled menac185
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
ingly in the corner all through this space of time. And it was now, about
little Lucie’s sixth birthday, that they began to have an awful sound, as
of a great storm in France with a dreadful sea rising.
On a night in mid-July, one thousand seven hundred and eighty-nine,
Mr. Lorry came in late, from Tellson’s, and sat himself down by Lucie
and her husband in the dark window. It was a hot, wild night, and they
were all three reminded of the old Sunday night when they had looked
at the lightning from the same place.
“I began to think,” said Mr. Lorry, pushing his brown wig back,
“that I should have to pass the night at Tellson’s. We have been so full
of business all day, that we have not known what to do first, or which
way to turn. There is such an uneasiness in Paris, that we have actually
a run of confidence upon us! Our customers over there, seem not to be
able to confide their property to us fast enough. There is positively a
mania among some of them for sending it to England.”
“That has a bad look,” said Darnay—
“A bad look, you say, my dear Darnay? Yes, but we don’t know
what reason there is in it. People are so unreasonable! Some of us
at Tellson’s are getting old, and we really can’t be troubled out of the
ordinary course without due occasion.”
“Still,” said Darnay, “you know how gloomy and threatening the
sky is.”
“I know that, to be sure,” assented Mr. Lorry, trying to persuade
himself that his sweet temper was soured, and that he grumbled, “but I
am determined to be peevish after my long day’s botheration. Where is
Manette?”
“Here he is,” said the Doctor, entering the dark room at the moment.
“I am quite glad you are at home; for these hurries and forebodings
by which I have been surrounded all day long, have made me nervous
without reason. You are not going out, I hope?”
“No; I am going to play backgammon with you, if you like,” said
the Doctor.
“I don’t think I do like, if I may speak my mind. I am not fit to be
pitted against you to-night. Is the teaboard still there, Lucie? I can’t
see.”
“Of course, it has been kept for you.”
“Thank ye, my dear. The precious child is safe in bed?”
“And sleeping soundly.”
“That’s right; all safe and well! I don’t know why anything should
186
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
be otherwise than safe and well here, thank God; but I have been so put
out all day, and I am not as young as I was! My tea, my dear! Thank
ye. Now, come and take your place in the circle, and let us sit quiet, and
hear the echoes about which you have your theory.”
“Not a theory; it was a fancy.”
“A fancy, then, my wise pet,” said Mr. Lorry, patting her hand.
“They are very numerous and very loud, though, are they not? Only
hear them!”
Headlong, mad, and dangerous footsteps to force their way into
anybody’s life, footsteps not easily made clean again if once stained red,
the footsteps raging in Saint Antoine afar off, as the little circle sat in
the dark London window.
Saint Antoine had been, that morning, a vast dusky mass of scarecrows heaving to and fro, with frequent gleams of light above the billowy heads, where steel blades and bayonets shone in the sun. A tremendous roar arose from the throat of Saint Antoine, and a forest of naked
arms struggled in the air like shrivelled branches of trees in a winter
wind: all the fingers convulsively clutching at every weapon or semblance of a weapon that was thrown up from the depths below, no
matter how far off.
Who gave them out, whence they last came, where they began,
through what agency they crookedly quivered and jerked, scores at a
time, over the heads of the crowd, like a kind of lightning, no eye in the
throng could have told; but, muskets were being distributed—so were
cartridges, powder, and ball, bars of iron and wood, knives, axes, pikes,
every weapon that distracted ingenuity could discover or devise. People
who could lay hold of nothing else, set themselves with bleeding hands
to force stones and bricks out of their places in walls. Every pulse and
heart in Saint Antoine was on high-fever strain and at high-fever heat.
Every living creature there held life as of no account, and was demented
with a passionate readiness to sacrifice it.
As a whirlpool of boiling waters has a centre point, so, all this raging
circled round Defarge’s wine-shop, and every human drop in the caldron
had a tendency to be sucked towards the vortex where Defarge himself,
already begrimed with gunpowder and sweat, issued orders, issued arms,
thrust this man back, dragged this man forward, disarmed one to arm
another, laboured and strove in the thickest of the uproar.
“Keep near to me, Jacques Three,” cried Defarge; “and do you,
Jacques One and Two, separate and put yourselves at the head of as
187
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
many of these patriots as you can. Where is my wife?”
“Eh, well! Here you see me!” said madame, composed as ever, but
not knitting to-day. Madame’s resolute right hand was occupied with
an axe, in place of the usual softer implements, and in her girdle were a
pistol and a cruel knife.
“Where do you go, my wife?”
“I go,” said madame, “with you at present. You shall see me at the
head of women, by-and-bye.”
“Come, then!” cried Defarge, in a resounding voice. “Patriots and
friends, we are ready! The Bastille!”
With a roar that sounded as if all the breath in France had been
shaped into the detested word, the living sea rose, wave on wave, depth
on depth, and overflowed the city to that point. Alarm-bells ringing,
drums beating, the sea raging and thundering on its new beach, the
attack began.
Deep ditches, double drawbridge, massive stone walls, eight great
towers, cannon, muskets, fire and smoke. Through the fire and through
the smoke—in the fire and in the smoke, for the sea cast him up against
a cannon, and on the instant he became a cannonier—Defarge of the
wine-shop worked like a manful soldier, Two fierce hours.
Deep ditch, single drawbridge, massive stone walls, eight great towers, cannon, muskets, fire and smoke. One drawbridge down! “Work,
comrades all, work! Work, Jacques One, Jacques Two, Jacques One
Thousand, Jacques Two Thousand, Jacques Five-and-Twenty Thousand;
in the name of all the Angels or the Devils—which you prefer—work!”
Thus Defarge of the wine-shop, still at his gun, which had long grown
hot.
“To me, women!” cried madame his wife. “What! We can kill as
well as the men when the place is taken!” And to her, with a shrill thirsty
cry, trooping women variously armed, but all armed alike in hunger and
revenge.
Cannon, muskets, fire and smoke; but, still the deep ditch, the single
drawbridge, the massive stone walls, and the eight great towers. Slight
displacements of the raging sea, made by the falling wounded. Flashing weapons, blazing torches, smoking waggonloads of wet straw, hard
work at neighbouring barricades in all directions, shrieks, volleys, execrations, bravery without stint, boom smash and rattle, and the furious
sounding of the living sea; but, still the deep ditch, and the single drawbridge, and the massive stone walls, and the eight great towers, and still
188
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
Defarge of the wine-shop at his gun, grown doubly hot by the service of
Four fierce hours.
A white flag from within the fortress, and a parley—this dimly perceptible through the raging storm, nothing audible in it—suddenly the
sea rose immeasurably wider and higher, and swept Defarge of the wineshop over the lowered drawbridge, past the massive stone outer walls,
in among the eight great towers surrendered!
So resistless was the force of the ocean bearing him on, that even
to draw his breath or turn his head was as impracticable as if he had
been struggling in the surf at the South Sea, until he was landed in the
outer courtyard of the Bastille. There, against an angle of a wall, he
made a struggle to look about him. Jacques Three was nearly at his
side; Madame Defarge, still heading some of her women, was visible
in the inner distance, and her knife was in her hand. Everywhere was
tumult, exultation, deafening and maniacal bewilderment, astounding
noise, yet furious dumb-show.
“The Prisoners!”
“The Records!”
“The secret cells!”
“The instruments of torture!”
“The Prisoners!”
Of all these cries, and ten thousand incoherences, “The Prisoners!”
was the cry most taken up by the sea that rushed in, as if there were
an eternity of people, as well as of time and space. When the foremost
billows rolled past, bearing the prison officers with them, and threatening them all with instant death if any secret nook remained undisclosed,
Defarge laid his strong hand on the breast of one of these men—a man
with a grey head, who had a lighted torch in his hand—separated him
from the rest, and got him between himself and the wall.
“Show me the North Tower!” said Defarge. “Quick!”
“I will faithfully,” replied the man, “if you will come with me. But
there is no one there.”
“What is the meaning of One Hundred and Five, North Tower?”
asked Defarge. “Quick!”
“The meaning, monsieur?”
“Does it mean a captive, or a place of captivity? Or do you mean
that I shall strike you dead?”
“Kill him!” croaked Jacques Three, who had come close up.
“Monsieur, it is a cell.”
189
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
“Show it me!”
“Pass this way, then.”
Jacques Three, with his usual craving on him, and evidently disappointed by the dialogue taking a turn that did not seem to promise
bloodshed, held by Defarge’s arm as he held by the turnkey’s. Their
three heads had been close together during this brief discourse, and it
had been as much as they could do to hear one another, even then: so
tremendous was the noise of the living ocean, in its irruption into the
Fortress, and its inundation of the courts and passages and staircases.
All around outside, too, it beat the walls with a deep, hoarse roar, from
which, occasionally, some partial shouts of tumult broke and leaped
into the air like spray.
Through gloomy vaults where the light of day had never shone, past
hideous doors of dark dens and cages, down cavernous flights of steps,
and again up steep rugged ascents of stone and brick, more like dry waterfalls than staircases, Defarge, the turnkey, and Jacques Three, linked
hand and arm, went with all the speed they could make. Here and there,
especially at first, the inundation started on them and swept by; but
when they had done descending, and were winding and climbing up a
tower, they were alone. Hemmed in here by the massive thickness of
walls and arches, the storm within the fortress and without was only
audible to them in a dull, subdued way, as if the noise out of which they
had come had almost destroyed their sense of hearing.
The turnkey stopped at a low door, put a key in a clashing lock,
swung the door slowly open, and said, as they all bent their heads and
passed in:
“One hundred and five, North Tower!”
There was a small, heavily-grated, unglazed window high in the wall,
with a stone screen before it, so that the sky could be only seen by stooping low and looking up. There was a small chimney, heavily barred
across, a few feet within. There was a heap of old feathery wood-ashes
on the hearth. There was a stool, and table, and a straw bed. There
were the four blackened walls, and a rusted iron ring in one of them.
“Pass that torch slowly along these walls, that I may see them,” said
Defarge to the turnkey.
The man obeyed, and Defarge followed the light closely with his
eyes.
“Stop!—Look here, Jacques!”
“A. M.!” croaked Jacques Three, as he read greedily.
190
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
“Alexandre Manette,” said Defarge in his ear, following the letters with his swart forefinger, deeply engrained with gunpowder. “And
here he wrote ‘a poor physician.’ And it was he, without doubt, who
scratched a calendar on this stone. What is that in your hand? A crowbar? Give it me!”
He had still the linstock of his gun in his own hand. He made a sudden exchange of the two instruments, and turning on the worm-eaten
stool and table, beat them to pieces in a few blows.
“Hold the light higher!” he said, wrathfully, to the turnkey. “Look
among those fragments with care, Jacques. And see! Here is my knife,”
throwing it to him; “rip open that bed, and search the straw. Hold the
light higher, you!”
With a menacing look at the turnkey he crawled upon the hearth,
and, peering up the chimney, struck and prised at its sides with the
crowbar, and worked at the iron grating across it. In a few minutes,
some mortar and dust came dropping down, which he averted his face
to avoid; and in it, and in the old wood-ashes, and in a crevice in the
chimney into which his weapon had slipped or wrought itself, he groped
with a cautious touch.
“Nothing in the wood, and nothing in the straw, Jacques?”
“Nothing.”
“Let us collect them together, in the middle of the cell. So! Light
them, you!”
The turnkey fired the little pile, which blazed high and hot. Stooping again to come out at the low-arched door, they left it burning, and
retraced their way to the courtyard; seeming to recover their sense of
hearing as they came down, until they were in the raging flood once
more.
They found it surging and tossing, in quest of Defarge himself. Saint
Antoine was clamorous to have its wine-shop keeper foremost in the
guard upon the governor who had defended the Bastille and shot the
people. Otherwise, the governor would not be marched to the Hotel de
Ville for judgment. Otherwise, the governor would escape, and the people’s blood (suddenly of some value, after many years of worthlessness)
be unavenged.
In the howling universe of passion and contention that seemed to
encompass this grim old officer conspicuous in his grey coat and red decoration, there was but one quite steady figure, and that was a woman’s.
“See, there is my husband!” she cried, pointing him out. “See Defarge!”
191
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
She stood immovable close to the grim old officer, and remained immovable close to him; remained immovable close to him through the streets,
as Defarge and the rest bore him along; remained immovable close to
him when he was got near his destination, and began to be struck at
from behind; remained immovable close to him when the long-gathering
rain of stabs and blows fell heavy; was so close to him when he dropped
dead under it, that, suddenly animated, she put her foot upon his neck,
and with her cruel knife—long ready—hewed off his head.
The hour was come, when Saint Antoine was to execute his horrible
idea of hoisting up men for lamps to show what he could be and do.
Saint Antoine’s blood was up, and the blood of tyranny and domination by the iron hand was down—down on the steps of the Hotel de
Ville where the governor’s body lay—down on the sole of the shoe of
Madame Defarge where she had trodden on the body to steady it for
mutilation. “Lower the lamp yonder!” cried Saint Antoine, after glaring round for a new means of death; “here is one of his soldiers to be
left on guard!” The swinging sentinel was posted, and the sea rushed
on.
The sea of black and threatening waters, and of destructive upheaving of wave against wave, whose depths were yet unfathomed and
whose forces were yet unknown. The remorseless sea of turbulently
swaying shapes, voices of vengeance, and faces hardened in the furnaces
of suffering until the touch of pity could make no mark on them.
But, in the ocean of faces where every fierce and furious expression was in vivid life, there were two groups of faces—each seven in
number—so fixedly contrasting with the rest, that never did sea roll
which bore more memorable wrecks with it. Seven faces of prisoners,
suddenly released by the storm that had burst their tomb, were carried
high overhead: all scared, all lost, all wondering and amazed, as if the
Last Day were come, and those who rejoiced around them were lost
spirits. Other seven faces there were, carried higher, seven dead faces,
whose drooping eyelids and half-seen eyes awaited the Last Day. Impassive faces, yet with a suspended—not an abolished—expression on
them; faces, rather, in a fearful pause, as having yet to raise the dropped
lids of the eyes, and bear witness with the bloodless lips, “Thou didst
it!”
Seven prisoners released, seven gory heads on pikes, the keys of the
accursed fortress of the eight strong towers, some discovered letters and
other memorials of prisoners of old time, long dead of broken hearts,—
192
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
such, and such—like, the loudly echoing footsteps of Saint Antoine escort through the Paris streets in mid-July, one thousand seven hundred
and eighty-nine. Now, Heaven defeat the fancy of Lucie Darnay, and
keep these feet far out of her life! For, they are headlong, mad, and
dangerous; and in the years so long after the breaking of the cask at Defarge’s wine-shop door, they are not easily purified when once stained
red.
Chapter 22
The Sea Still Rises
Haggard Saint Antoine had had only one exultant week, in which
to soften his modicum of hard and bitter bread to such extent as he
could, with the relish of fraternal embraces and congratulations, when
Madame Defarge sat at her counter, as usual, presiding over the customers. Madame Defarge wore no rose in her head, for the great brotherhood of Spies had become, even in one short week, extremely chary of
trusting themselves to the saint’s mercies. The lamps across his streets
had a portentously elastic swing with them.
Madame Defarge, with her arms folded, sat in the morning light
and heat, contemplating the wine-shop and the street. In both, there
were several knots of loungers, squalid and miserable, but now with
a manifest sense of power enthroned on their distress. The raggedest
nightcap, awry on the wretchedest head, had this crooked significance
in it: “I know how hard it has grown for me, the wearer of this, to
support life in myself; but do you know how easy it has grown for me,
the wearer of this, to destroy life in you?” Every lean bare arm, that had
been without work before, had this work always ready for it now, that
it could strike. The fingers of the knitting women were vicious, with the
experience that they could tear. There was a change in the appearance of
Saint Antoine; the image had been hammering into this for hundreds of
years, and the last finishing blows had told mightily on the expression.
Madame Defarge sat observing it, with such suppressed approval as
was to be desired in the leader of the Saint Antoine women. One of
her sisterhood knitted beside her. The short, rather plump wife of a
starved grocer, and the mother of two children withal, this lieutenant
had already earned the complimentary name of The Vengeance.
193
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
“Hark!” said The Vengeance. “Listen, then! Who comes?”
As if a train of powder laid from the outermost bound of Saint Antoine Quarter to the wine-shop door, had been suddenly fired, a fastspreading murmur came rushing along.
“It is Defarge,” said madame. “Silence, patriots!”
Defarge came in breathless, pulled off a red cap he wore, and looked
around him! “Listen, everywhere!” said madame again. “Listen to
him!” Defarge stood, panting, against a background of eager eyes and
open mouths, formed outside the door; all those within the wine-shop
had sprung to their feet.
“Say then, my husband. What is it?”
“News from the other world!”
“How, then?” cried madame, contemptuously. “The other world?”
“Does everybody here recall old Foulon, who told the famished people that they might eat grass, and who died, and went to Hell?”
“Everybody!” from all throats.
“The news is of him. He is among us!”
“Among us!” from the universal throat again. “And dead?”
“Not dead! He feared us so much—and with reason—that he caused
himself to be represented as dead, and had a grand mock-funeral. But
they have found him alive, hiding in the country, and have brought him
in. I have seen him but now, on his way to the Hotel de Ville, a prisoner.
I have said that he had reason to fear us. Say all! Had he reason?”
Wretched old sinner of more than threescore years and ten, if he had
never known it yet, he would have known it in his heart of hearts if he
could have heard the answering cry.
A moment of profound silence followed. Defarge and his wife
looked steadfastly at one another. The Vengeance stooped, and the jar
of a drum was heard as she moved it at her feet behind the counter.
“Patriots!” said Defarge, in a determined voice, “are we ready?”
Instantly Madame Defarge’s knife was in her girdle; the drum was
beating in the streets, as if it and a drummer had flown together by
magic; and The Vengeance, uttering terrific shrieks, and flinging her
arms about her head like all the forty Furies at once, was tearing from
house to house, rousing the women.
The men were terrible, in the bloody-minded anger with which they
looked from windows, caught up what arms they had, and came pouring down into the streets; but, the women were a sight to chill the boldest. From such household occupations as their bare poverty yielded,
194
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
from their children, from their aged and their sick crouching on the
bare ground famished and naked, they ran out with streaming hair, urging one another, and themselves, to madness with the wildest cries and
actions. Villain Foulon taken, my sister! Old Foulon taken, my mother!
Miscreant Foulon taken, my daughter! Then, a score of others ran into
the midst of these, beating their breasts, tearing their hair, and screaming, Foulon alive! Foulon who told the starving people they might eat
grass! Foulon who told my old father that he might eat grass, when
I had no bread to give him! Foulon who told my baby it might suck
grass, when these breasts where dry with want! O mother of God, this
Foulon! O Heaven our suffering! Hear me, my dead baby and my withered father: I swear on my knees, on these stones, to avenge you on
Foulon! Husbands, and brothers, and young men, Give us the blood of
Foulon, Give us the head of Foulon, Give us the heart of Foulon, Give
us the body and soul of Foulon, Rend Foulon to pieces, and dig him
into the ground, that grass may grow from him! With these cries, numbers of the women, lashed into blind frenzy, whirled about, striking and
tearing at their own friends until they dropped into a passionate swoon,
and were only saved by the men belonging to them from being trampled
under foot.
Nevertheless, not a moment was lost; not a moment! This Foulon
was at the Hotel de Ville, and might be loosed. Never, if Saint Antoine
knew his own sufferings, insults, and wrongs! Armed men and women
flocked out of the Quarter so fast, and drew even these last dregs after
them with such a force of suction, that within a quarter of an hour there
was not a human creature in Saint Antoine’s bosom but a few old crones
and the wailing children.
No. They were all by that time choking the Hall of Examination
where this old man, ugly and wicked, was, and overflowing into the
adjacent open space and streets. The Defarges, husband and wife, The
Vengeance, and Jacques Three, were in the first press, and at no great
distance from him in the Hall.
“See!” cried madame, pointing with her knife. “See the old villain
bound with ropes. That was well done to tie a bunch of grass upon his
back. Ha, ha! That was well done. Let him eat it now!” Madame put
her knife under her arm, and clapped her hands as at a play.
The people immediately behind Madame Defarge, explaining the
cause of her satisfaction to those behind them, and those again explaining to others, and those to others, the neighbouring streets resounded
195
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
with the clapping of hands. Similarly, during two or three hours of
drawl, and the winnowing of many bushels of words, Madame Defarge’s frequent expressions of impatience were taken up, with marvellous quickness, at a distance: the more readily, because certain men who
had by some wonderful exercise of agility climbed up the external architecture to look in from the windows, knew Madame Defarge well, and
acted as a telegraph between her and the crowd outside the building.
At length the sun rose so high that it struck a kindly ray as of hope
or protection, directly down upon the old prisoner’s head. The favour
was too much to bear; in an instant the barrier of dust and chaff that
had stood surprisingly long, went to the winds, and Saint Antoine had
got him!
It was known directly, to the furthest confines of the crowd. Defarge had but sprung over a railing and a table, and folded the miserable wretch in a deadly embrace—Madame Defarge had but followed
and turned her hand in one of the ropes with which he was tied—The
Vengeance and Jacques Three were not yet up with them, and the men
at the windows had not yet swooped into the Hall, like birds of prey
from their high perches—when the cry seemed to go up, all over the city,
“Bring him out! Bring him to the lamp!”
Down, and up, and head foremost on the steps of the building; now,
on his knees; now, on his feet; now, on his back; dragged, and struck
at, and stifled by the bunches of grass and straw that were thrust into
his face by hundreds of hands; torn, bruised, panting, bleeding, yet always entreating and beseeching for mercy; now full of vehement agony
of action, with a small clear space about him as the people drew one another back that they might see; now, a log of dead wood drawn through
a forest of legs; he was hauled to the nearest street corner where one
of the fatal lamps swung, and there Madame Defarge let him go—as a
cat might have done to a mouse—and silently and composedly looked
at him while they made ready, and while he besought her: the women
passionately screeching at him all the time, and the men sternly calling
out to have him killed with grass in his mouth. Once, he went aloft,
and the rope broke, and they caught him shrieking; twice, he went aloft,
and the rope broke, and they caught him shrieking; then, the rope was
merciful, and held him, and his head was soon upon a pike, with grass
enough in the mouth for all Saint Antoine to dance at the sight of.
Nor was this the end of the day’s bad work, for Saint Antoine so
shouted and danced his angry blood up, that it boiled again, on hearing
196
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
when the day closed in that the son-in-law of the despatched, another of
the people’s enemies and insulters, was coming into Paris under a guard
five hundred strong, in cavalry alone. Saint Antoine wrote his crimes
on flaring sheets of paper, seized him—would have torn him out of the
breast of an army to bear Foulon company—set his head and heart on
pikes, and carried the three spoils of the day, in Wolf-procession through
the streets.
Not before dark night did the men and women come back to the
children, wailing and breadless. Then, the miserable bakers’ shops were
beset by long files of them, patiently waiting to buy bad bread; and while
they waited with stomachs faint and empty, they beguiled the time by
embracing one another on the triumphs of the day, and achieving them
again in gossip. Gradually, these strings of ragged people shortened and
frayed away; and then poor lights began to shine in high windows, and
slender fires were made in the streets, at which neighbours cooked in
common, afterwards supping at their doors.
Scanty and insufficient suppers those, and innocent of meat, as of
most other sauce to wretched bread. Yet, human fellowship infused
some nourishment into the flinty viands, and struck some sparks of
cheerfulness out of them. Fathers and mothers who had had their full
share in the worst of the day, played gently with their meagre children;
and lovers, with such a world around them and before them, loved and
hoped.
It was almost morning, when Defarge’s wine-shop parted with its
last knot of customers, and Monsieur Defarge said to madame his wife,
in husky tones, while fastening the door:
“At last it is come, my dear!”
“Eh well!” returned madame. “Almost.”
Saint Antoine slept, the Defarges slept: even The Vengeance slept
with her starved grocer, and the drum was at rest. The drum’s was the
only voice in Saint Antoine that blood and hurry had not changed. The
Vengeance, as custodian of the drum, could have wakened him up and
had the same speech out of him as before the Bastille fell, or old Foulon
was seized; not so with the hoarse tones of the men and women in Saint
Antoine’s bosom.
197
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
Chapter 23
Fire Rises
There was a change on the village where the fountain fell, and where the
mender of roads went forth daily to hammer out of the stones on the
highway such morsels of bread as might serve for patches to hold his
poor ignorant soul and his poor reduced body together. The prison on
the crag was not so dominant as of yore; there were soldiers to guard it,
but not many; there were officers to guard the soldiers, but not one of
them knew what his men would do—beyond this: that it would probably not be what he was ordered.
Far and wide lay a ruined country, yielding nothing but desolation.
Every green leaf, every blade of grass and blade of grain, was as shrivelled and poor as the miserable people. Everything was bowed down,
dejected, oppressed, and broken. Habitations, fences, domesticated animals, men, women, children, and the soil that bore them—all worn
out.
Monseigneur (often a most worthy individual gentleman) was a national blessing, gave a chivalrous tone to things, was a polite example of
luxurious and shining fife, and a great deal more to equal purpose; nevertheless, Monseigneur as a class had, somehow or other, brought things
to this. Strange that Creation, designed expressly for Monseigneur,
should be so soon wrung dry and squeezed out! There must be something short-sighted in the eternal arrangements, surely! Thus it was,
however; and the last drop of blood having been extracted from the
flints, and the last screw of the rack having been turned so often that
its purchase crumbled, and it now turned and turned with nothing to
bite, Monseigneur began to run away from a phenomenon so low and
unaccountable.
But, this was not the change on the village, and on many a village
like it. For scores of years gone by, Monseigneur had squeezed it and
wrung it, and had seldom graced it with his presence except for the pleasures of the chase—now, found in hunting the people; now, found in
hunting the beasts, for whose preservation Monseigneur made edifying
spaces of barbarous and barren wilderness. No. The change consisted
in the appearance of strange faces of low caste, rather than in the disappearance of the high caste, chiselled, and otherwise beautified and
beautifying features of Monseigneur.
198
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
For, in these times, as the mender of roads worked, solitary, in the
dust, not often troubling himself to reflect that dust he was and to dust
he must return, being for the most part too much occupied in thinking
how little he had for supper and how much more he would eat if he
had it—in these times, as he raised his eyes from his lonely labour, and
viewed the prospect, he would see some rough figure approaching on
foot, the like of which was once a rarity in those parts, but was now a
frequent presence. As it advanced, the mender of roads would discern
without surprise, that it was a shaggy-haired man, of almost barbarian
aspect, tall, in wooden shoes that were clumsy even to the eyes of a
mender of roads, grim, rough, swart, steeped in the mud and dust of
many highways, dank with the marshy moisture of many low grounds,
sprinkled with the thorns and leaves and moss of many byways through
woods.
Such a man came upon him, like a ghost, at noon in the July weather,
as he sat on his heap of stones under a bank, taking such shelter as he
could get from a shower of hail.
The man looked at him, looked at the village in the hollow, at the
mill, and at the prison on the crag. When he had identified these objects in what benighted mind he had, he said, in a dialect that was just
intelligible:
“How goes it, Jacques?”
“All well, Jacques.”
“Touch then!”
They joined hands, and the man sat down on the heap of stones.
“No dinner?”
“Nothing but supper now,” said the mender of roads, with a hungry
face.
“It is the fashion,” growled the man. “I meet no dinner anywhere.”
He took out a blackened pipe, filled it, lighted it with flint and steel,
pulled at it until it was in a bright glow: then, suddenly held it from him
and dropped something into it from between his finger and thumb, that
blazed and went out in a puff of smoke.
“Touch then.” It was the turn of the mender of roads to say it this
time, after observing these operations. They again joined hands.
“To-night?” said the mender of roads.
“To-night,” said the man, putting the pipe in his mouth.
“Where?”
“Here.”
199
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
He and the mender of roads sat on the heap of stones looking silently
at one another, with the hail driving in between them like a pigmy
charge of bayonets, until the sky began to clear over the village.
“Show me!” said the traveller then, moving to the brow of the hill.
“See!” returned the mender of roads, with extended finger. “You go
down here, and straight through the street, and past the fountain—”
“To the Devil with all that!” interrupted the other, rolling his eye
over the landscape. “I go through no streets and past no fountains.
Well?”
“Well! About two leagues beyond the summit of that hill above the
village.”
“Good. When do you cease to work?”
“At sunset.”
“Will you wake me, before departing? I have walked two nights
without resting. Let me finish my pipe, and I shall sleep like a child.
Will you wake me?”
“Surely.”
The wayfarer smoked his pipe out, put it in his breast, slipped off
his great wooden shoes, and lay down on his back on the heap of stones.
He was fast asleep directly.
As the road-mender plied his dusty labour, and the hail-clouds,
rolling away, revealed bright bars and streaks of sky which were responded to by silver gleams upon the landscape, the little man (who
wore a red cap now, in place of his blue one) seemed fascinated by the
figure on the heap of stones. His eyes were so often turned towards
it, that he used his tools mechanically, and, one would have said, to
very poor account. The bronze face, the shaggy black hair and beard,
the coarse woollen red cap, the rough medley dress of home-spun stuff
and hairy skins of beasts, the powerful frame attenuated by spare living,
and the sullen and desperate compression of the lips in sleep, inspired
the mender of roads with awe. The traveller had travelled far, and his
feet were footsore, and his ankles chafed and bleeding; his great shoes,
stuffed with leaves and grass, had been heavy to drag over the many
long leagues, and his clothes were chafed into holes, as he himself was
into sores. Stooping down beside him, the road-mender tried to get
a peep at secret weapons in his breast or where not; but, in vain, for
he slept with his arms crossed upon him, and set as resolutely as his
lips. Fortified towns with their stockades, guard-houses, gates, trenches,
and drawbridges, seemed to the mender of roads, to be so much air as
200
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
against this figure. And when he lifted his eyes from it to the horizon
and looked around, he saw in his small fancy similar figures, stopped
by no obstacle, tending to centres all over France.
The man slept on, indifferent to showers of hail and intervals of
brightness, to sunshine on his face and shadow, to the paltering lumps
of dull ice on his body and the diamonds into which the sun changed
them, until the sun was low in the west, and the sky was glowing. Then,
the mender of roads having got his tools together and all things ready
to go down into the village, roused him.
“Good!” said the sleeper, rising on his elbow. “Two leagues beyond
the summit of the hill?”
“About.”
“About. Good!”
The mender of roads went home, with the dust going on before him
according to the set of the wind, and was soon at the fountain, squeezing
himself in among the lean kine brought there to drink, and appearing
even to whisper to them in his whispering to all the village. When the
village had taken its poor supper, it did not creep to bed, as it usually did,
but came out of doors again, and remained there. A curious contagion
of whispering was upon it, and also, when it gathered together at the
fountain in the dark, another curious contagion of looking expectantly
at the sky in one direction only. Monsieur Gabelle, chief functionary of
the place, became uneasy; went out on his house-top alone, and looked
in that direction too; glanced down from behind his chimneys at the
darkening faces by the fountain below, and sent word to the sacristan
who kept the keys of the church, that there might be need to ring the
tocsin by-and-bye.
The night deepened. The trees environing the old chateau, keeping
its solitary state apart, moved in a rising wind, as though they threatened the pile of building massive and dark in the gloom. Up the two
terrace flights of steps the rain ran wildly, and beat at the great door,
like a swift messenger rousing those within; uneasy rushes of wind went
through the hall, among the old spears and knives, and passed lamenting up the stairs, and shook the curtains of the bed where the last Marquis had slept. East, West, North, and South, through the woods, four
heavy-treading, unkempt figures crushed the high grass and cracked the
branches, striding on cautiously to come together in the courtyard. Four
lights broke out there, and moved away in different directions, and all
was black again.
201
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
But, not for long. Presently, the chateau began to make itself
strangely visible by some light of its own, as though it were growing luminous. Then, a flickering streak played behind the architecture of the
front, picking out transparent places, and showing where balustrades,
arches, and windows were. Then it soared higher, and grew broader
and brighter. Soon, from a score of the great windows, flames burst
forth, and the stone faces awakened, stared out of fire.
A faint murmur arose about the house from the few people who
were left there, and there was a saddling of a horse and riding away.
There was spurring and splashing through the darkness, and bridle was
drawn in the space by the village fountain, and the horse in a foam
stood at Monsieur Gabelle’s door. “Help, Gabelle! Help, every one!”
The tocsin rang impatiently, but other help (if that were any) there
was none. The mender of roads, and two hundred and fifty particular friends, stood with folded arms at the fountain, looking at the pillar
of fire in the sky. “It must be forty feet high,” said they, grimly; and
never moved.
The rider from the chateau, and the horse in a foam, clattered away
through the village, and galloped up the stony steep, to the prison on
the crag. At the gate, a group of officers were looking at the fire; removed from them, a group of soldiers. “Help, gentlemen—officers!
The chateau is on fire; valuable objects may be saved from the flames by
timely aid! Help, help!” The officers looked towards the soldiers who
looked at the fire; gave no orders; and answered, with shrugs and biting
of lips, “It must burn.”
As the rider rattled down the hill again and through the street, the
village was illuminating. The mender of roads, and the two hundred
and fifty particular friends, inspired as one man and woman by the idea
of lighting up, had darted into their houses, and were putting candles
in every dull little pane of glass. The general scarcity of everything,
occasioned candles to be borrowed in a rather peremptory manner of
Monsieur Gabelle; and in a moment of reluctance and hesitation on that
functionary’s part, the mender of roads, once so submissive to authority,
had remarked that carriages were good to make bonfires with, and that
post-horses would roast.
The chateau was left to itself to flame and burn. In the roaring
and raging of the conflagration, a red-hot wind, driving straight from
the infernal regions, seemed to be blowing the edifice away. With the
rising and falling of the blaze, the stone faces showed as if they were
202
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
in torment. When great masses of stone and timber fell, the face with
the two dints in the nose became obscured: anon struggled out of the
smoke again, as if it were the face of the cruel Marquis, burning at the
stake and contending with the fire.
The chateau burned; the nearest trees, laid hold of by the fire,
scorched and shrivelled; trees at a distance, fired by the four fierce figures, begirt the blazing edifice with a new forest of smoke. Molten lead
and iron boiled in the marble basin of the fountain; the water ran dry;
the extinguisher tops of the towers vanished like ice before the heat,
and trickled down into four rugged wells of flame. Great rents and
splits branched out in the solid walls, like crystallisation; stupefied birds
wheeled about and dropped into the furnace; four fierce figures trudged
away, East, West, North, and South, along the night-enshrouded roads,
guided by the beacon they had lighted, towards their next destination.
The illuminated village had seized hold of the tocsin, and, abolishing
the lawful ringer, rang for joy.
Not only that; but the village, light-headed with famine, fire, and
bell-ringing, and bethinking itself that Monsieur Gabelle had to do with
the collection of rent and taxes—though it was but a small instalment
of taxes, and no rent at all, that Gabelle had got in those latter days—
became impatient for an interview with him, and, surrounding his house,
summoned him to come forth for personal conference. Whereupon,
Monsieur Gabelle did heavily bar his door, and retire to hold counsel
with himself. The result of that conference was, that Gabelle again withdrew himself to his housetop behind his stack of chimneys; this time
resolved, if his door were broken in (he was a small Southern man of retaliative temperament), to pitch himself head foremost over the parapet,
and crush a man or two below.
Probably, Monsieur Gabelle passed a long night up there, with the
distant chateau for fire and candle, and the beating at his door, combined with the joy-ringing, for music; not to mention his having an
ill-omened lamp slung across the road before his posting-house gate,
which the village showed a lively inclination to displace in his favour.
A trying suspense, to be passing a whole summer night on the brink of
the black ocean, ready to take that plunge into it upon which Monsieur
Gabelle had resolved! But, the friendly dawn appearing at last, and the
rush-candles of the village guttering out, the people happily dispersed,
and Monsieur Gabelle came down bringing his life with him for that
while.
203

Within a hundred miles, and in the light of other fires, there were
other functionaries less fortunate, that night and other nights, whom the
rising sun found hanging across once-peaceful streets, where they had
been born and bred; also, there were other villagers and townspeople
less fortunate than the mender of roads and his fellows, upon whom the
functionaries and soldiery turned with success, and whom they strung
up in their turn. But, the fierce figures were steadily wending East, West,
North, and South, be that as it would; and whosoever hung, fire burned.
The altitude of the gallows that would turn to water and quench it,
no functionary, by any stretch of mathematics, was able to calculate
successfully.
Chapter 24
Drawn to the Loadstone Rock
In such risings of fire and risings of sea—the firm earth shaken by the
rushes of an angry ocean which had now no ebb, but was always on the
flow, higher and higher, to the terror and wonder of the beholders on the
shore—three years of tempest were consumed. Three more birthdays of
little Lucie had been woven by the golden thread into the peaceful tissue
of the life of her home.
Many a night and many a day had its inmates listened to the echoes
in the corner, with hearts that failed them when they heard the thronging
feet. For, the footsteps had become to their minds as the footsteps of a
people, tumultuous under a red flag and with their country declared in
danger, changed into wild beasts, by terrible enchantment long persisted
in.
Monseigneur, as a class, had dissociated himself from the phenomenon of his not being appreciated: of his being so little wanted in
France, as to incur considerable danger of receiving his dismissal from
it, and this life together. Like the fabled rustic who raised the Devil with
infinite pains, and was so terrified at the sight of him that he could ask
the Enemy no question, but immediately fled; so, Monseigneur, after
boldly reading the Lord’s Prayer backwards for a great number of years,
and performing many other potent spells for compelling the Evil One,
no sooner beheld him in his terrors than he took to his noble heels.
204
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
The shining Bull’s Eye of the Court was gone, or it would have been
the mark for a hurricane of national bullets. It had never been a good
eye to see with—had long had the mote in it of Lucifer’s pride, Sardana—
palus’s luxury, and a mole’s blindness—but it had dropped out and was
gone. The Court, from that exclusive inner circle to its outermost rotten
ring of intrigue, corruption, and dissimulation, was all gone together.
Royalty was gone; had been besieged in its Palace and “suspended,”
when the last tidings came over.
The August of the year one thousand seven hundred and ninety-two
was come, and Monseigneur was by this time scattered far and wide.
As was natural, the head-quarters and great gathering-place of Monseigneur, in London, was Tellson’s Bank. Spirits are supposed to haunt
the places where their bodies most resorted, and Monseigneur without
a guinea haunted the spot where his guineas used to be. Moreover, it
was the spot to which such French intelligence as was most to be relied
upon, came quickest. Again: Tellson’s was a munificent house, and extended great liberality to old customers who had fallen from their high
estate. Again: those nobles who had seen the coming storm in time, and
anticipating plunder or confiscation, had made provident remittances
to Tellson’s, were always to be heard of there by their needy brethren.
To which it must be added that every new-comer from France reported
himself and his tidings at Tellson’s, almost as a matter of course. For
such variety of reasons, Tellson’s was at that time, as to French intelligence, a kind of High Exchange; and this was so well known to the
public, and the inquiries made there were in consequence so numerous,
that Tellson’s sometimes wrote the latest news out in a line or so and
posted it in the Bank windows, for all who ran through Temple Bar to
read.
On a steaming, misty afternoon, Mr. Lorry sat at his desk, and
Charles Darnay stood leaning on it, talking with him in a low voice.
The penitential den once set apart for interviews with the House, was
now the news-Exchange, and was filled to overflowing. It was within
half an hour or so of the time of closing.
“But, although you are the youngest man that ever lived,” said
Charles Darnay, rather hesitating, “I must still suggest to you—”
“I understand. That I am too old?” said Mr. Lorry.
“Unsettled weather, a long journey, uncertain means of travelling, a
disorganised country, a city that may not be even safe for you.”
“My dear Charles,” said Mr. Lorry, with cheerful confidence, “you
205
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
touch some of the reasons for my going: not for my staying away. It is
safe enough for me; nobody will care to interfere with an old fellow of
hard upon fourscore when there are so many people there much better
worth interfering with. As to its being a disorganised city, if it were not
a disorganised city there would be no occasion to send somebody from
our House here to our House there, who knows the city and the business,
of old, and is in Tellson’s confidence. As to the uncertain travelling, the
long journey, and the winter weather, if I were not prepared to submit
myself to a few inconveniences for the sake of Tellson’s, after all these
years, who ought to be?”
“I wish I were going myself,” said Charles Darnay, somewhat restlessly, and like one thinking aloud.
“Indeed! You are a pretty fellow to object and advise!” exclaimed
Mr. Lorry. “You wish you were going yourself? And you a Frenchman
born? You are a wise counsellor.”
“My dear Mr. Lorry, it is because I am a Frenchman born, that
the thought (which I did not mean to utter here, however) has passed
through my mind often. One cannot help thinking, having had some
sympathy for the miserable people, and having abandoned something
to them,” he spoke here in his former thoughtful manner, “that one
might be listened to, and might have the power to persuade to some
restraint. Only last night, after you had left us, when I was talking to
Lucie—”
“When you were talking to Lucie,” Mr. Lorry repeated. “Yes. I
wonder you are not ashamed to mention the name of Lucie! Wishing
you were going to France at this time of day!”
“However, I am not going,” said Charles Darnay, with a smile. “It
is more to the purpose that you say you are.”
“And I am, in plain reality. The truth is, my dear Charles,” Mr.
Lorry glanced at the distant House, and lowered his voice, “you can
have no conception of the difficulty with which our business is transacted, and of the peril in which our books and papers over yonder are
involved. The Lord above knows what the compromising consequences
would be to numbers of people, if some of our documents were seized
or destroyed; and they might be, at any time, you know, for who can
say that Paris is not set afire to-day, or sacked to-morrow! Now, a judicious selection from these with the least possible delay, and the burying
of them, or otherwise getting of them out of harm’s way, is within the
power (without loss of precious time) of scarcely any one but myself, if
206
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
any one. And shall I hang back, when Tellson’s knows this and says
this—Tellson’s, whose bread I have eaten these sixty years—because I
am a little stiff about the joints? Why, I am a boy, sir, to half a dozen
old codgers here!”
“How I admire the gallantry of your youthful spirit, Mr. Lorry.”
“Tut! Nonsense, sir!—And, my dear Charles,” said Mr. Lorry, glancing at the House again, “you are to remember, that getting things out of
Paris at this present time, no matter what things, is next to an impossibility. Papers and precious matters were this very day brought to us here
(I speak in strict confidence; it is not business-like to whisper it, even to
you), by the strangest bearers you can imagine, every one of whom had
his head hanging on by a single hair as he passed the Barriers. At another time, our parcels would come and go, as easily as in business-like
Old England; but now, everything is stopped.”
“And do you really go to-night?”
“I really go to-night, for the case has become too pressing to admit
of delay.”
“And do you take no one with you?”
“All sorts of people have been proposed to me, but I will have nothing to say to any of them. I intend to take Jerry. Jerry has been my
bodyguard on Sunday nights for a long time past and I am used to him.
Nobody will suspect Jerry of being anything but an English bull-dog, or
of having any design in his head but to fly at anybody who touches his
master.”
“I must say again that I heartily admire your gallantry and youthfulness.”
“I must say again, nonsense, nonsense! When I have executed this
little commission, I shall, perhaps, accept Tellson’s proposal to retire
and live at my ease. Time enough, then, to think about growing old.”
This dialogue had taken place at Mr. Lorry’s usual desk, with Monseigneur swarming within a yard or two of it, boastful of what he would
do to avenge himself on the rascal-people before long. It was too much
the way of Monseigneur under his reverses as a refugee, and it was
much too much the way of native British orthodoxy, to talk of this terrible Revolution as if it were the only harvest ever known under the skies
that had not been sown—as if nothing had ever been done, or omitted
to be done, that had led to it—as if observers of the wretched millions
in France, and of the misused and perverted resources that should have
made them prosperous, had not seen it inevitably coming, years before,
207
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
and had not in plain words recorded what they saw. Such vapouring,
combined with the extravagant plots of Monseigneur for the restoration of a state of things that had utterly exhausted itself, and worn out
Heaven and earth as well as itself, was hard to be endured without some
remonstrance by any sane man who knew the truth. And it was such
vapouring all about his ears, like a troublesome confusion of blood in
his own head, added to a latent uneasiness in his mind, which had already made Charles Darnay restless, and which still kept him so.
Among the talkers, was Stryver, of the King’s Bench Bar, far on his
way to state promotion, and, therefore, loud on the theme: broaching
to Monseigneur, his devices for blowing the people up and exterminating them from the face of the earth, and doing without them: and for
accomplishing many similar objects akin in their nature to the abolition of eagles by sprinkling salt on the tails of the race. Him, Darnay
heard with a particular feeling of objection; and Darnay stood divided
between going away that he might hear no more, and remaining to interpose his word, when the thing that was to be, went on to shape itself
out.
The House approached Mr. Lorry, and laying a soiled and unopened
letter before him, asked if he had yet discovered any traces of the person
to whom it was addressed? The House laid the letter down so close to
Darnay that he saw the direction—the more quickly because it was his
own right name. The address, turned into English, ran:
“Very pressing. To Monsieur heretofore the Marquis St. Evremonde,
of France. Confided to the cares of Messrs. Tellson and Co., Bankers,
London, England.”
On the marriage morning, Doctor Manette had made it his one urgent and express request to Charles Darnay, that the secret of this name
should be—unless he, the Doctor, dissolved the obligation—kept inviolate between them. Nobody else knew it to be his name; his own wife
had no suspicion of the fact; Mr. Lorry could have none.
“No,” said Mr. Lorry, in reply to the House; “I have referred it, I
think, to everybody now here, and no one can tell me where this gentleman is to be found.”
The hands of the clock verging upon the hour of closing the Bank,
there was a general set of the current of talkers past Mr. Lorry’s desk.
He held the letter out inquiringly; and Monseigneur looked at it, in the
person of this plotting and indignant refugee; and Monseigneur looked
at it in the person of that plotting and indignant refugee; and This, That,
208
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
and The Other, all had something disparaging to say, in French or in
English, concerning the Marquis who was not to be found.
“Nephew, I believe—but in any case degenerate successor—of the
polished Marquis who was murdered,” said one. “Happy to say, I never
knew him.”
“A craven who abandoned his post,” said another—this Monseigneur had been got out of Paris, legs uppermost and half suffocated,
in a load of hay—“some years ago.”
“Infected with the new doctrines,” said a third, eyeing the direction
through his glass in passing; “set himself in opposition to the last Marquis, abandoned the estates when he inherited them, and left them to the
ruffian herd. They will recompense him now, I hope, as he deserves.”
“Hey?” cried the blatant Stryver. “Did he though? Is that the sort
of fellow? Let us look at his infamous name. D—n the fellow!”
Darnay, unable to restrain himself any longer, touched Mr. Stryver
on the shoulder, and said:
“I know the fellow.”
“Do you, by Jupiter?” said Stryver. “I am sorry for it.”
“Why?”
“Why, Mr. Darnay? D’ye hear what he did? Don’t ask, why, in these
times.”
“But I do ask why?”
“Then I tell you again, Mr. Darnay, I am sorry for it. I am sorry
to hear you putting any such extraordinary questions. Here is a fellow,
who, infected by the most pestilent and blasphemous code of devilry
that ever was known, abandoned his property to the vilest scum of the
earth that ever did murder by wholesale, and you ask me why I am sorry
that a man who instructs youth knows him? Well, but I’ll answer you.
I am sorry because I believe there is contamination in such a scoundrel.
That’s why.”
Mindful of the secret, Darnay with great difficulty checked himself,
and said: “You may not understand the gentleman.”
“I understand how to put you in a corner, Mr. Darnay,” said Bully
Stryver, “and I’ll do it. If this fellow is a gentleman, I don’t understand
him. You may tell him so, with my compliments. You may also tell
him, from me, that after abandoning his worldly goods and position to
this butcherly mob, I wonder he is not at the head of them. But, no,
gentlemen,” said Stryver, looking all round, and snapping his fingers, “I
know something of human nature, and I tell you that you’ll never find
209
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
a fellow like this fellow, trusting himself to the mercies of such precious
proteges. No, gentlemen; he’ll always show ’em a clean pair of heels
very early in the scuffle, and sneak away.”
With those words, and a final snap of his fingers, Mr. Stryver shouldered himself into Fleet-street, amidst the general approbation of his
hearers. Mr. Lorry and Charles Darnay were left alone at the desk, in
the general departure from the Bank.
“Will you take charge of the letter?” said Mr. Lorry. “You know
where to deliver it?”
“I do.”
“Will you undertake to explain, that we suppose it to have been
addressed here, on the chance of our knowing where to forward it, and
that it has been here some time?”
“I will do so. Do you start for Paris from here?”
“From here, at eight.”
“I will come back, to see you off.”
Very ill at ease with himself, and with Stryver and most other men,
Darnay made the best of his way into the quiet of the Temple, opened
the letter, and read it. These were its contents:
“Prison of the Abbaye, Paris.
“June 21, 1792.
“Monsieur heretofore the Marquis.
“After having long been in danger of my life at the hands of the village, I have been seized, with great violence and indignity, and brought
a long journey on foot to Paris. On the road I have suffered a great deal.
Nor is that all; my house has been destroyed—razed to the ground.
“The crime for which I am imprisoned, Monsieur heretofore the
Marquis, and for which I shall be summoned before the tribunal, and
shall lose my life (without your so generous help), is, they tell me, treason against the majesty of the people, in that I have acted against them
for an emigrant. It is in vain I represent that I have acted for them,
and not against, according to your commands. It is in vain I represent
that, before the sequestration of emigrant property, I had remitted the
imposts they had ceased to pay; that I had collected no rent; that I had
had recourse to no process. The only response is, that I have acted for
an emigrant, and where is that emigrant?
“Ah! most gracious Monsieur heretofore the Marquis, where is that
emigrant? I cry in my sleep where is he? I demand of Heaven, will
he not come to deliver me? No answer. Ah Monsieur heretofore the
210
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
Marquis, I send my desolate cry across the sea, hoping it may perhaps
reach your ears through the great bank of Tilson known at Paris!
“For the love of Heaven, of justice, of generosity, of the honour of
your noble name, I supplicate you, Monsieur heretofore the Marquis,
to succour and release me. My fault is, that I have been true to you. Oh
Monsieur heretofore the Marquis, I pray you be you true to me!
“From this prison here of horror, whence I every hour tend nearer
and nearer to destruction, I send you, Monsieur heretofore the Marquis,
the assurance of my dolorous and unhappy service.
“Your afflicted,
“Gabelle.”
The latent uneasiness in Darnay’s mind was roused to vigourous life
by this letter. The peril of an old servant and a good one, whose only
crime was fidelity to himself and his family, stared him so reproachfully
in the face, that, as he walked to and fro in the Temple considering what
to do, he almost hid his face from the passersby.
He knew very well, that in his horror of the deed which had culminated the bad deeds and bad reputation of the old family house, in his
resentful suspicions of his uncle, and in the aversion with which his conscience regarded the crumbling fabric that he was supposed to uphold,
he had acted imperfectly. He knew very well, that in his love for Lucie,
his renunciation of his social place, though by no means new to his own
mind, had been hurried and incomplete. He knew that he ought to have
systematically worked it out and supervised it, and that he had meant
to do it, and that it had never been done.
The happiness of his own chosen English home, the necessity of being always actively employed, the swift changes and troubles of the time
which had followed on one another so fast, that the events of this week
annihilated the immature plans of last week, and the events of the week
following made all new again; he knew very well, that to the force of
these circumstances he had yielded:—not without disquiet, but still without continuous and accumulating resistance. That he had watched the
times for a time of action, and that they had shifted and struggled until
the time had gone by, and the nobility were trooping from France by
every highway and byway, and their property was in course of confiscation and destruction, and their very names were blotting out, was as
well known to himself as it could be to any new authority in France that
might impeach him for it.
But, he had oppressed no man, he had imprisoned no man; he was
211
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
so far from having harshly exacted payment of his dues, that he had
relinquished them of his own will, thrown himself on a world with no
favour in it, won his own private place there, and earned his own bread.
Monsieur Gabelle had held the impoverished and involved estate on
written instructions, to spare the people, to give them what little there
was to give—such fuel as the heavy creditors would let them have in the
winter, and such produce as could be saved from the same grip in the
summer—and no doubt he had put the fact in plea and proof, for his
own safety, so that it could not but appear now.
This favoured the desperate resolution Charles Darnay had begun to
make, that he would go to Paris.
Yes. Like the mariner in the old story, the winds and streams had
driven him within the influence of the Loadstone Rock, and it was drawing him to itself, and he must go. Everything that arose before his mind
drifted him on, faster and faster, more and more steadily, to the terrible
attraction. His latent uneasiness had been, that bad aims were being
worked out in his own unhappy land by bad instruments, and that he
who could not fail to know that he was better than they, was not there,
trying to do something to stay bloodshed, and assert the claims of mercy
and humanity. With this uneasiness half stifled, and half reproaching
him, he had been brought to the pointed comparison of himself with the
brave old gentleman in whom duty was so strong; upon that comparison
(injurious to himself) had instantly followed the sneers of Monseigneur,
which had stung him bitterly, and those of Stryver, which above all were
coarse and galling, for old reasons. Upon those, had followed Gabelle’s
letter: the appeal of an innocent prisoner, in danger of death, to his
justice, honour, and good name.
His resolution was made. He must go to Paris.
Yes. The Loadstone Rock was drawing him, and he must sail on,
until he struck. He knew of no rock; he saw hardly any danger. The
intention with which he had done what he had done, even although he
had left it incomplete, presented it before him in an aspect that would be
gratefully acknowledged in France on his presenting himself to assert it.
Then, that glorious vision of doing good, which is so often the sanguine
mirage of so many good minds, arose before him, and he even saw himself in the illusion with some influence to guide this raging Revolution
that was running so fearfully wild.
As he walked to and fro with his resolution made, he considered that
neither Lucie nor her father must know of it until he was gone. Lucie
212
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
should be spared the pain of separation; and her father, always reluctant
to turn his thoughts towards the dangerous ground of old, should come
to the knowledge of the step, as a step taken, and not in the balance of
suspense and doubt. How much of the incompleteness of his situation
was referable to her father, through the painful anxiety to avoid reviving
old associations of France in his mind, he did not discuss with himself.
But, that circumstance too, had had its influence in his course.
He walked to and fro, with thoughts very busy, until it was time to
return to Tellson’s and take leave of Mr. Lorry. As soon as he arrived
in Paris he would present himself to this old friend, but he must say
nothing of his intention now.
A carriage with post-horses was ready at the Bank door, and Jerry
was booted and equipped.
“I have delivered that letter,” said Charles Darnay to Mr. Lorry. “I
would not consent to your being charged with any written answer, but
perhaps you will take a verbal one?”
“That I will, and readily,” said Mr. Lorry, “if it is not dangerous.”
“Not at all. Though it is to a prisoner in the Abbaye.”
“What is his name?” said Mr. Lorry, with his open pocket-book in
his hand.
“Gabelle.”
“Gabelle. And what is the message to the unfortunate Gabelle in
prison?”
“Simply, ‘that he has received the letter, and will come.’ ”
“Any time mentioned?”
“He will start upon his journey to-morrow night.”
“Any person mentioned?”
“No.”
He helped Mr. Lorry to wrap himself in a number of coats and
cloaks, and went out with him from the warm atmosphere of the old
Bank, into the misty air of Fleet-street. “My love to Lucie, and to little
Lucie,” said Mr. Lorry at parting, “and take precious care of them till I
come back.” Charles Darnay shook his head and doubtfully smiled, as
the carriage rolled away.
That night—it was the fourteenth of August—he sat up late, and
wrote two fervent letters; one was to Lucie, explaining the strong obligation he was under to go to Paris, and showing her, at length, the reasons
that he had, for feeling confident that he could become involved in no
personal danger there; the other was to the Doctor, confiding Lucie and
213
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
their dear child to his care, and dwelling on the same topics with the
strongest assurances. To both, he wrote that he would despatch letters
in proof of his safety, immediately after his arrival.
It was a hard day, that day of being among them, with the first reservation of their joint lives on his mind. It was a hard matter to preserve
the innocent deceit of which they were profoundly unsuspicious. But,
an affectionate glance at his wife, so happy and busy, made him resolute not to tell her what impended (he had been half moved to do it,
so strange it was to him to act in anything without her quiet aid), and
the day passed quickly. Early in the evening he embraced her, and her
scarcely less dear namesake, pretending that he would return by-andbye (an imaginary engagement took him out, and he had secreted a
valise of clothes ready), and so he emerged into the heavy mist of the
heavy streets, with a heavier heart.
The unseen force was drawing him fast to itself, now, and all the
tides and winds were setting straight and strong towards it. He left
his two letters with a trusty porter, to be delivered half an hour before
midnight, and no sooner; took horse for Dover; and began his journey.
“For the love of Heaven, of justice, of generosity, of the honour of your
noble name!” was the poor prisoner’s cry with which he strengthened
his sinking heart, as he left all that was dear on earth behind him, and
floated away for the Loadstone Rock.
214
Book the Third
The Track of a Storm
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
Chapter 1
In Secret
The traveller fared slowly on his way, who fared towards Paris from
England in the autumn of the year one thousand seven hundred and
ninety-two. More than enough of bad roads, bad equipages, and bad
horses, he would have encountered to delay him, though the fallen and
unfortunate King of France had been upon his throne in all his glory;
but, the changed times were fraught with other obstacles than these. Every town-gate and village taxing-house had its band of citizen-patriots,
with their national muskets in a most explosive state of readiness, who
stopped all comers and goers, cross-questioned them, inspected their
papers, looked for their names in lists of their own, turned them back,
or sent them on, or stopped them and laid them in hold, as their capricious judgment or fancy deemed best for the dawning Republic One and
Indivisible, of Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death.
A very few French leagues of his journey were accomplished, when
Charles Darnay began to perceive that for him along these country
roads there was no hope of return until he should have been declared
a good citizen at Paris. Whatever might befall now, he must on to his
journey’s end. Not a mean village closed upon him, not a common barrier dropped across the road behind him, but he knew it to be another
iron door in the series that was barred between him and England. The
universal watchfulness so encompassed him, that if he had been taken
in a net, or were being forwarded to his destination in a cage, he could
not have felt his freedom more completely gone.
This universal watchfulness not only stopped him on the highway
twenty times in a stage, but retarded his progress twenty times in a day,
by riding after him and taking him back, riding before him and stopping
him by anticipation, riding with him and keeping him in charge. He had
been days upon his journey in France alone, when he went to bed tired
out, in a little town on the high road, still a long way from Paris.
Nothing but the production of the afflicted Gabelle’s letter from his
prison of the Abbaye would have got him on so far. His difficulty at the
guard-house in this small place had been such, that he felt his journey
to have come to a crisis. And he was, therefore, as little surprised as
a man could be, to find himself awakened at the small inn to which he
had been remitted until morning, in the middle of the night.
216
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
Awakened by a timid local functionary and three armed patriots in
rough red caps and with pipes in their mouths, who sat down on the
bed.
“Emigrant,” said the functionary, “I am going to send you on to
Paris, under an escort.”
“Citizen, I desire nothing more than to get to Paris, though I could
dispense with the escort.”
“Silence!” growled a red-cap, striking at the coverlet with the buttend of his musket. “Peace, aristocrat!”
“It is as the good patriot says,” observed the timid functionary.
“You are an aristocrat, and must have an escort—and must pay for it.”
“I have no choice,” said Charles Darnay.
“Choice! Listen to him!” cried the same scowling red-cap. “As if it
was not a favour to be protected from the lamp-iron!”
“It is always as the good patriot says,” observed the functionary.
“Rise and dress yourself, emigrant.”
Darnay complied, and was taken back to the guard-house, where
other patriots in rough red caps were smoking, drinking, and sleeping,
by a watch-fire. Here he paid a heavy price for his escort, and hence he
started with it on the wet, wet roads at three o’clock in the morning.
The escort were two mounted patriots in red caps and tri-coloured
cockades, armed with national muskets and sabres, who rode one on
either side of him.
The escorted governed his own horse, but a loose line was attached
to his bridle, the end of which one of the patriots kept girded round
his wrist. In this state they set forth with the sharp rain driving in their
faces: clattering at a heavy dragoon trot over the uneven town pavement,
and out upon the mire-deep roads. In this state they traversed without
change, except of horses and pace, all the mire-deep leagues that lay
between them and the capital.
They travelled in the night, halting an hour or two after daybreak,
and lying by until the twilight fell. The escort were so wretchedly
clothed, that they twisted straw round their bare legs, and thatched
their ragged shoulders to keep the wet off. Apart from the personal
discomfort of being so attended, and apart from such considerations
of present danger as arose from one of the patriots being chronically
drunk, and carrying his musket very recklessly, Charles Darnay did not
allow the restraint that was laid upon him to awaken any serious fears
in his breast; for, he reasoned with himself that it could have no refer217
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
ence to the merits of an individual case that was not yet stated, and of
representations, confirmable by the prisoner in the Abbaye, that were
not yet made.
But when they came to the town of Beauvais—which they did at
eventide, when the streets were filled with people—he could not conceal
from himself that the aspect of affairs was very alarming. An ominous
crowd gathered to see him dismount of the posting-yard, and many
voices called out loudly, “Down with the emigrant!”
He stopped in the act of swinging himself out of his saddle, and,
resuming it as his safest place, said:
“Emigrant, my friends! Do you not see me here, in France, of my
own will?”
“You are a cursed emigrant,” cried a farrier, making at him in a
furious manner through the press, hammer in hand; “and you are a
cursed aristocrat!”
The postmaster interposed himself between this man and the rider’s
bridle (at which he was evidently making), and soothingly said, “Let
him be; let him be! He will be judged at Paris.”
“Judged!” repeated the farrier, swinging his hammer. “Ay! and
condemned as a traitor.” At this the crowd roared approval.
Checking the postmaster, who was for turning his horse’s head to
the yard (the drunken patriot sat composedly in his saddle looking on,
with the line round his wrist), Darnay said, as soon as he could make
his voice heard:
“Friends, you deceive yourselves, or you are deceived. I am not a
traitor.”
“He lies!” cried the smith. “He is a traitor since the decree. His life
is forfeit to the people. His cursed life is not his own!”
At the instant when Darnay saw a rush in the eyes of the crowd,
which another instant would have brought upon him, the postmaster turned his horse into the yard, the escort rode in close upon his
horse’s flanks, and the postmaster shut and barred the crazy double
gates. The farrier struck a blow upon them with his hammer, and the
crowd groaned; but, no more was done.
“What is this decree that the smith spoke of?” Darnay asked the
postmaster, when he had thanked him, and stood beside him in the
yard.
“Truly, a decree for selling the property of emigrants.”
“When passed?”
218
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
“On the fourteenth.”
“The day I left England!”
“Everybody says it is but one of several, and that there will be
others—if there are not already-banishing all emigrants, and condemning all to death who return. That is what he meant when he said your
life was not your own.”
“But there are no such decrees yet?”
“What do I know!” said the postmaster, shrugging his shoulders;
“there may be, or there will be. It is all the same. What would you
have?”
They rested on some straw in a loft until the middle of the night,
and then rode forward again when all the town was asleep. Among the
many wild changes observable on familiar things which made this wild
ride unreal, not the least was the seeming rarity of sleep. After long
and lonely spurring over dreary roads, they would come to a cluster
of poor cottages, not steeped in darkness, but all glittering with lights,
and would find the people, in a ghostly manner in the dead of the night,
circling hand in hand round a shrivelled tree of Liberty, or all drawn up
together singing a Liberty song. Happily, however, there was sleep in
Beauvais that night to help them out of it and they passed on once more
into solitude and loneliness: jingling through the untimely cold and wet,
among impoverished fields that had yielded no fruits of the earth that
year, diversified by the blackened remains of burnt houses, and by the
sudden emergence from ambuscade, and sharp reining up across their
way, of patriot patrols on the watch on all the roads.
Daylight at last found them before the wall of Paris. The barrier was
closed and strongly guarded when they rode up to it.
“Where are the papers of this prisoner?” demanded a resolutelooking man in authority, who was summoned out by the guard.
Naturally struck by the disagreeable word, Charles Darnay requested the speaker to take notice that he was a free traveller and French
citizen, in charge of an escort which the disturbed state of the country
had imposed upon him, and which he had paid for.
“Where,” repeated the same personage, without taking any heed of
him whatever, “are the papers of this prisoner?”
The drunken patriot had them in his cap, and produced them.
Casting his eyes over Gabelle’s letter, the same personage in authority
showed some disorder and surprise, and looked at Darnay with a close
attention.
219
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
He left escort and escorted without saying a word, however, and
went into the guard-room; meanwhile, they sat upon their horses outside the gate. Looking about him while in this state of suspense, Charles
Darnay observed that the gate was held by a mixed guard of soldiers and
patriots, the latter far outnumbering the former; and that while ingress
into the city for peasants’ carts bringing in supplies, and for similar traffic and traffickers, was easy enough, egress, even for the homeliest people, was very difficult. A numerous medley of men and women, not to
mention beasts and vehicles of various sorts, was waiting to issue forth;
but, the previous identification was so strict, that they filtered through
the barrier very slowly. Some of these people knew their turn for examination to be so far off, that they lay down on the ground to sleep or
smoke, while others talked together, or loitered about. The red cap and
tri-colour cockade were universal, both among men and women.
When he had sat in his saddle some half-hour, taking note of these
things, Darnay found himself confronted by the same man in authority,
who directed the guard to open the barrier. Then he delivered to the
escort, drunk and sober, a receipt for the escorted, and requested him
to dismount. He did so, and the two patriots, leading his tired horse,
turned and rode away without entering the city.
He accompanied his conductor into a guard-room, smelling of common wine and tobacco, where certain soldiers and patriots, asleep and
awake, drunk and sober, and in various neutral states between sleeping
and waking, drunkenness and sobriety, were standing and lying about.
The light in the guard-house, half derived from the waning oil-lamps
of the night, and half from the overcast day, was in a correspondingly
uncertain condition. Some registers were lying open on a desk, and an
officer of a coarse, dark aspect, presided over these.
“Citizen Defarge,” said he to Darnay’s conductor, as he took a slip
of paper to write on. “Is this the emigrant Evremonde?”
“This is the man.”
“Your age, Evremonde?”
“Thirty-seven.”
“Married, Evremonde?”
“Yes.”
“Where married?”
“In England.”
“Without doubt. Where is your wife, Evremonde?”
“In England.”
220
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
“Without doubt. You are consigned, Evremonde, to the prison of
La Force.”
“Just Heaven!” exclaimed Darnay. “Under what law, and for what
offence?”
The officer looked up from his slip of paper for a moment.
“We have new laws, Evremonde, and new offences, since you were
here.” He said it with a hard smile, and went on writing.
“I entreat you to observe that I have come here voluntarily, in response to that written appeal of a fellow-countryman which lies before
you. I demand no more than the opportunity to do so without delay. Is
not that my right?”
“Emigrants have no rights, Evremonde,” was the stolid reply. The
officer wrote until he had finished, read over to himself what he had
written, sanded it, and handed it to Defarge, with the words “In secret.”
Defarge motioned with the paper to the prisoner that he must accompany him. The prisoner obeyed, and a guard of two armed patriots
attended them.
“Is it you,” said Defarge, in a low voice, as they went down the
guardhouse steps and turned into Paris, “who married the daughter of
Doctor Manette, once a prisoner in the Bastille that is no more?”
“Yes,” replied Darnay, looking at him with surprise.
“My name is Defarge, and I keep a wine-shop in the Quarter Saint
Antoine. Possibly you have heard of me.”
“My wife came to your house to reclaim her father? Yes!”
The word “wife” seemed to serve as a gloomy reminder to Defarge,
to say with sudden impatience, “In the name of that sharp female newlyborn, and called La Guillotine, why did you come to France?”
“You heard me say why, a minute ago. Do you not believe it is the
truth?”
“A bad truth for you,” said Defarge, speaking with knitted brows,
and looking straight before him.
“Indeed I am lost here. All here is so unprecedented, so changed, so
sudden and unfair, that I am absolutely lost. Will you render me a little
help?”
“None.” Defarge spoke, always looking straight before him.
“Will you answer me a single question?”
“Perhaps. According to its nature. You can say what it is.”
“In this prison that I am going to so unjustly, shall I have some free
communication with the world outside?”
221
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
“You will see.”
“I am not to be buried there, prejudged, and without any means of
presenting my case?”
“You will see. But, what then? Other people have been similarly
buried in worse prisons, before now.”
“But never by me, Citizen Defarge.”
Defarge glanced darkly at him for answer, and walked on in a steady
and set silence. The deeper he sank into this silence, the fainter hope
there was—or so Darnay thought—of his softening in any slight degree.
He, therefore, made haste to say:
“It is of the utmost importance to me (you know, Citizen, even better
than I, of how much importance), that I should be able to communicate
to Mr. Lorry of Tellson’s Bank, an English gentleman who is now in
Paris, the simple fact, without comment, that I have been thrown into
the prison of La Force. Will you cause that to be done for me?”
“I will do,” Defarge doggedly rejoined, “nothing for you. My duty
is to my country and the People. I am the sworn servant of both, against
you. I will do nothing for you.”
Charles Darnay felt it hopeless to entreat him further, and his pride
was touched besides. As they walked on in silence, he could not but see
how used the people were to the spectacle of prisoners passing along the
streets. The very children scarcely noticed him. A few passers turned
their heads, and a few shook their fingers at him as an aristocrat; otherwise, that a man in good clothes should be going to prison, was no more
remarkable than that a labourer in working clothes should be going to
work. In one narrow, dark, and dirty street through which they passed,
an excited orator, mounted on a stool, was addressing an excited audience on the crimes against the people, of the king and the royal family.
The few words that he caught from this man’s lips, first made it known
to Charles Darnay that the king was in prison, and that the foreign ambassadors had one and all left Paris. On the road (except at Beauvais)
he had heard absolutely nothing. The escort and the universal watchfulness had completely isolated him.
That he had fallen among far greater dangers than those which had
developed themselves when he left England, he of course knew now.
That perils had thickened about him fast, and might thicken faster and
faster yet, he of course knew now. He could not but admit to himself
that he might not have made this journey, if he could have foreseen
the events of a few days. And yet his misgivings were not so dark as,
222
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
imagined by the light of this later time, they would appear. Troubled
as the future was, it was the unknown future, and in its obscurity there
was ignorant hope. The horrible massacre, days and nights long, which,
within a few rounds of the clock, was to set a great mark of blood upon
the blessed garnering time of harvest, was as far out of his knowledge
as if it had been a hundred thousand years away. The “sharp female
newly-born, and called La Guillotine,” was hardly known to him, or to
the generality of people, by name. The frightful deeds that were to be
soon done, were probably unimagined at that time in the brains of the
doers. How could they have a place in the shadowy conceptions of a
gentle mind?
Of unjust treatment in detention and hardship, and in cruel separation from his wife and child, he foreshadowed the likelihood, or the
certainty; but, beyond this, he dreaded nothing distinctly. With this on
his mind, which was enough to carry into a dreary prison courtyard, he
arrived at the prison of La Force.
A man with a bloated face opened the strong wicket, to whom Defarge presented “The Emigrant Evremonde.”
“What the Devil! How many more of them!” exclaimed the man
with the bloated face.
Defarge took his receipt without noticing the exclamation, and withdrew, with his two fellow-patriots.
“What the Devil, I say again!” exclaimed the gaoler, left with his
wife. “How many more!”
The gaoler’s wife, being provided with no answer to the question,
merely replied, “One must have patience, my dear!” Three turnkeys
who entered responsive to a bell she rang, echoed the sentiment, and
one added, “For the love of Liberty;” which sounded in that place like
an inappropriate conclusion.
The prison of La Force was a gloomy prison, dark and filthy, and
with a horrible smell of foul sleep in it. Extraordinary how soon the
noisome flavour of imprisoned sleep, becomes manifest in all such places
that are ill cared for!
“In secret, too,” grumbled the gaoler, looking at the written paper.
“As if I was not already full to bursting!”
He stuck the paper on a file, in an ill-humour, and Charles Darnay
awaited his further pleasure for half an hour: sometimes, pacing to and
fro in the strong arched room: sometimes, resting on a stone seat: in
either case detained to be imprinted on the memory of the chief and his
223
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
subordinates.
“Come!” said the chief, at length taking up his keys, “come with
me, emigrant.”
Through the dismal prison twilight, his new charge accompanied
him by corridor and staircase, many doors clanging and locking behind
them, until they came into a large, low, vaulted chamber, crowded with
prisoners of both sexes. The women were seated at a long table, reading
and writing, knitting, sewing, and embroidering; the men were for the
most part standing behind their chairs, or lingering up and down the
room.
In the instinctive association of prisoners with shameful crime and
disgrace, the new-comer recoiled from this company. But the crowning
unreality of his long unreal ride, was, their all at once rising to receive
him, with every refinement of manner known to the time, and with all
the engaging graces and courtesies of life.
So strangely clouded were these refinements by the prison manners
and gloom, so spectral did they become in the inappropriate squalor
and misery through which they were seen, that Charles Darnay seemed
to stand in a company of the dead. Ghosts all! The ghost of beauty, the
ghost of stateliness, the ghost of elegance, the ghost of pride, the ghost
of frivolity, the ghost of wit, the ghost of youth, the ghost of age, all
waiting their dismissal from the desolate shore, all turning on him eyes
that were changed by the death they had died in coming there.
It struck him motionless. The gaoler standing at his side, and the
other gaolers moving about, who would have been well enough as to
appearance in the ordinary exercise of their functions, looked so extravagantly coarse contrasted with sorrowing mothers and blooming daughters who were there—with the apparitions of the coquette, the young
beauty, and the mature woman delicately bred—that the inversion of all
experience and likelihood which the scene of shadows presented, was
heightened to its utmost. Surely, ghosts all. Surely, the long unreal ride
some progress of disease that had brought him to these gloomy shades!
“In the name of the assembled companions in misfortune,” said a
gentleman of courtly appearance and address, coming forward, “I have
the honour of giving you welcome to La Force, and of condoling with
you on the calamity that has brought you among us. May it soon terminate happily! It would be an impertinence elsewhere, but it is not so
here, to ask your name and condition?”
Charles Darnay roused himself, and gave the required information,
224
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
in words as suitable as he could find.
“But I hope,” said the gentleman, following the chief gaoler with his
eyes, who moved across the room, “that you are not in secret?”
“I do not understand the meaning of the term, but I have heard them
say so.”
“Ah, what a pity! We so much regret it! But take courage; several
members of our society have been in secret, at first, and it has lasted but
a short time.” Then he added, raising his voice, “I grieve to inform the
society—in secret.”
There was a murmur of commiseration as Charles Darnay crossed
the room to a grated door where the gaoler awaited him, and many
voices—among which, the soft and compassionate voices of women
were conspicuous—gave him good wishes and encouragement. He
turned at the grated door, to render the thanks of his heart; it closed
under the gaoler’s hand; and the apparitions vanished from his sight
forever.
The wicket opened on a stone staircase, leading upward. When they
bad ascended forty steps (the prisoner of half an hour already counted
them), the gaoler opened a low black door, and they passed into a solitary cell. It struck cold and damp, but was not dark.
“Yours,” said the gaoler.
“Why am I confined alone?”
“How do I know!”
“I can buy pen, ink, and paper?”
“Such are not my orders. You will be visited, and can ask then. At
present, you may buy your food, and nothing more.”
There were in the cell, a chair, a table, and a straw mattress. As
the gaoler made a general inspection of these objects, and of the four
walls, before going out, a wandering fancy wandered through the mind
of the prisoner leaning against the wall opposite to him, that this gaoler
was so unwholesomely bloated, both in face and person, as to look like
a man who had been drowned and filled with water. When the gaoler
was gone, he thought in the same wandering way, “Now am I left, as if
I were dead.” Stopping then, to look down at the mattress, he turned
from it with a sick feeling, and thought, “And here in these crawling
creatures is the first condition of the body after death.”
“Five paces by four and a half, five paces by four and a half, five
paces by four and a half.” The prisoner walked to and fro in his cell,
counting its measurement, and the roar of the city arose like muffled
225
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
drums with a wild swell of voices added to them. “He made shoes, he
made shoes, he made shoes.” The prisoner counted the measurement
again, and paced faster, to draw his mind with him from that latter repetition. “The ghosts that vanished when the wicket closed. There was
one among them, the appearance of a lady dressed in black, who was
leaning in the embrasure of a window, and she had a light shining upon
her golden hair, and she looked like * * * * Let us ride on again, for
God’s sake, through the illuminated villages with the people all awake!
* * * * He made shoes, he made shoes, he made shoes. * * * * Five
paces by four and a half.” With such scraps tossing and rolling upward
from the depths of his mind, the prisoner walked faster and faster, obstinately counting and counting; and the roar of the city changed to this
extent—that it still rolled in like muffled drums, but with the wail of
voices that he knew, in the swell that rose above them.
Chapter 2
The Grindstone
Tellson’s Bank, established in the Saint Germain Quarter of Paris, was in
a wing of a large house, approached by a courtyard and shut off from
the street by a high wall and a strong gate. The house belonged to a
great nobleman who had lived in it until he made a flight from the troubles, in his own cook’s dress, and got across the borders. A mere beast
of the chase flying from hunters, he was still in his metempsychosis no
other than the same Monseigneur, the preparation of whose chocolate
for whose lips had once occupied three strong men besides the cook in
question.
Monseigneur gone, and the three strong men absolving themselves
from the sin of having drawn his high wages, by being more than ready
and willing to cut his throat on the altar of the dawning Republic one
and indivisible of Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death, Monseigneur’s
house had been first sequestrated, and then confiscated. For, all things
moved so fast, and decree followed decree with that fierce precipitation,
that now upon the third night of the autumn month of September, patriot emissaries of the law were in possession of Monseigneur’s house,
and had marked it with the tri-colour, and were drinking brandy in its
state apartments.
226
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
A place of business in London like Tellson’s place of business in Paris,
would soon have driven the House out of its mind and into the Gazette.
For, what would staid British responsibility and respectability have said
to orange-trees in boxes in a Bank courtyard, and even to a Cupid over
the counter? Yet such things were. Tellson’s had whitewashed the Cupid,
but he was still to be seen on the ceiling, in the coolest linen, aiming (as
he very often does) at money from morning to night. Bankruptcy must
inevitably have come of this young Pagan, in Lombard-street, London,
and also of a curtained alcove in the rear of the immortal boy, and also
of a looking-glass let into the wall, and also of clerks not at all old, who
danced in public on the slightest provocation. Yet, a French Tellson’s
could get on with these things exceedingly well, and, as long as the
times held together, no man had taken fright at them, and drawn out
his money.
What money would be drawn out of Tellson’s henceforth, and what
would lie there, lost and forgotten; what plate and jewels would tarnish
in Tellson’s hiding-places, while the depositors rusted in prisons, and
when they should have violently perished; how many accounts with
Tellson’s never to be balanced in this world, must be carried over into
the next; no man could have said, that night, any more than Mr. Jarvis
Lorry could, though he thought heavily of these questions. He sat by
a newly-lighted wood fire (the blighted and unfruitful year was prematurely cold), and on his honest and courageous face there was a deeper
shade than the pendent lamp could throw, or any object in the room
distortedly reflect—a shade of horror.
He occupied rooms in the Bank, in his fidelity to the House of which
he had grown to be a part, lie strong root-ivy. it chanced that they
derived a kind of security from the patriotic occupation of the main
building, but the true-hearted old gentleman never calculated about that.
All such circumstances were indifferent to him, so that he did his duty.
On the opposite side of the courtyard, under a colonnade, was extensive
standing—for carriages—where, indeed, some carriages of Monseigneur
yet stood. Against two of the pillars were fastened two great flaring
flambeaux, and in the light of these, standing out in the open air, was
a large grindstone: a roughly mounted thing which appeared to have
hurriedly been brought there from some neighbouring smithy, or other
workshop. Rising and looking out of window at these harmless objects,
Mr. Lorry shivered, and retired to his seat by the fire. He had opened,
not only the glass window, but the lattice blind outside it, and he had
227
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
closed both again, and he shivered through his frame.
From the streets beyond the high wall and the strong gate, there
came the usual night hum of the city, with now and then an indescribable ring in it, weird and unearthly, as if some unwonted sounds of a
terrible nature were going up to Heaven.
“Thank God,” said Mr. Lorry, clasping his hands, “that no one near
and dear to me is in this dreadful town to-night. May He have mercy
on all who are in danger!”
Soon afterwards, the bell at the great gate sounded, and he thought,
“They have come back!” and sat listening. But, there was no loud
irruption into the courtyard, as he had expected, and he heard the gate
clash again, and all was quiet.
The nervousness and dread that were upon him inspired that vague
uneasiness respecting the Bank, which a great change would naturally
awaken, with such feelings roused. It was well guarded, and he got up
to go among the trusty people who were watching it, when his door
suddenly opened, and two figures rushed in, at sight of which he fell
back in amazement.
Lucie and her father! Lucie with her arms stretched out to him, and
with that old look of earnestness so concentrated and intensified, that it
seemed as though it had been stamped upon her face expressly to give
force and power to it in this one passage of her life.
“What is this?” cried Mr. Lorry, breathless and confused. “What is
the matter? Lucie! Manette! What has happened? What has brought
you here? What is it?”
With the look fixed upon him, in her paleness and wildness, she
panted out in his arms, imploringly, “O my dear friend! My husband!”
“Your husband, Lucie?”
“Charles.”
“What of Charles?”
“Here.
“Here, in Paris?”
“Has been here some days—three or four—I don’t know how
many—I can’t collect my thoughts. An errand of generosity brought
him here unknown to us; he was stopped at the barrier, and sent to
prison.”
The old man uttered an irrepressible cry. Almost at the same moment, the beg of the great gate rang again, and a loud noise of feet and
voices came pouring into the courtyard.
228
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
“What is that noise?” said the Doctor, turning towards the window.
“Don’t look!” cried Mr. Lorry. “Don’t look out! Manette, for your
life, don’t touch the blind!”
The Doctor turned, with his hand upon the fastening of the window,
and said, with a cool, bold smile:
“My dear friend, I have a charmed life in this city. I have been a
Bastille prisoner. There is no patriot in Paris—in Paris? In France—
who, knowing me to have been a prisoner in the Bastille, would touch
me, except to overwhelm me with embraces, or carry me in triumph.
My old pain has given me a power that has brought us through the
barrier, and gained us news of Charles there, and brought us here. I
knew it would be so; I knew I could help Charles out of all danger;
I told Lucie so.—What is that noise?” His hand was again upon the
window.
“Don’t look!” cried Mr. Lorry, absolutely desperate. “No, Lucie,
my dear, nor you!” He got his arm round her, and held her. “Don’t be
so terrified, my love. I solemnly swear to you that I know of no harm
having happened to Charles; that I had no suspicion even of his being
in this fatal place. What prison is he in?”
“La Force!”
“La Force! Lucie, my child, if ever you were brave and serviceable
in your life—and you were always both—you will compose yourself
now, to do exactly as I bid you; for more depends upon it than you can
think, or I can say. There is no help for you in any action on your part
to-night; you cannot possibly stir out. I say this, because what I must
bid you to do for Charles’s sake, is the hardest thing to do of all. You
must instantly be obedient, still, and quiet. You must let me put you in
a room at the back here. You must leave your father and me alone for
two minutes, and as there are Life and Death in the world you must not
delay.”
“I will be submissive to you. I see in your face that you know I can
do nothing else than this. I know you are true.”
The old man kissed her, and hurried her into his room, and turned
the key; then, came hurrying back to the Doctor, and opened the window and partly opened the blind, and put his hand upon the Doctor’s
arm, and looked out with him into the courtyard.
Looked out upon a throng of men and women: not enough in number, or near enough, to fill the courtyard: not more than forty or fifty
in all. The people in possession of the house had let them in at the gate,
229
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
and they had rushed in to work at the grindstone; it had evidently been
set up there for their purpose, as in a convenient and retired spot.
But, such awful workers, and such awful work!
The grindstone had a double handle, and, turning at it madly
were two men, whose faces, as their long hair Rapped back when the
whirlings of the grindstone brought their faces up, were more horrible
and cruel than the visages of the wildest savages in their most barbarous
disguise. False eyebrows and false moustaches were stuck upon them,
and their hideous countenances were all bloody and sweaty, and all
awry with howling, and all staring and glaring with beastly excitement
and want of sleep. As these ruffians turned and turned, their matted
locks now flung forward over their eyes, now flung backward over their
necks, some women held wine to their mouths that they might drink;
and what with dropping blood, and what with dropping wine, and what
with the stream of sparks struck out of the stone, all their wicked atmosphere seemed gore and fire. The eye could not detect one creature in
the group free from the smear of blood. Shouldering one another to
get next at the sharpening-stone, were men stripped to the waist, with
the stain all over their limbs and bodies; men in all sorts of rags, with
the stain upon those rags; men devilishly set off with spoils of women’s
lace and silk and ribbon, with the stain dyeing those trifles through and
through. Hatchets, knives, bayonets, swords, all brought to be sharpened, were all red with it. Some of the hacked swords were tied to the
wrists of those who carried them, with strips of linen and fragments of
dress: ligatures various in kind, but all deep of the one colour. And as
the frantic wielders of these weapons snatched them from the stream of
sparks and tore away into the streets, the same red hue was red in their
frenzied eyes;—eyes which any unbrutalised beholder would have given
twenty years of life, to petrify with a well-directed gun.
All this was seen in a moment, as the vision of a drowning man, or
of any human creature at any very great pass, could see a world if it
were there. They drew back from the window, and the Doctor looked
for explanation in his friend’s ashy face.
“They are,” Mr. Lorry whispered the words, glancing fearfully
round at the locked room, “murdering the prisoners. If you are sure
of what you say; if you really have the power you think you have—as I
believe you have—make yourself known to these devils, and get taken
to La Force. It may be too late, I don’t know, but let it not be a minute
later!”
230
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
Doctor Manette pressed his hand, hastened bareheaded out of the
room, and was in the courtyard when Mr. Lorry regained the blind.
His streaming white hair, his remarkable face, and the impetuous
confidence of his manner, as he put the weapons aside like water, carried him in an instant to the heart of the concourse at the stone. For
a few moments there was a pause, and a hurry, and a murmur, and
the unintelligible sound of his voice; and then Mr. Lorry saw him, surrounded by all, and in the midst of a line of twenty men long, all linked
shoulder to shoulder, and hand to shoulder, hurried out with cries of—
“Live the Bastille prisoner! Help for the Bastille prisoner’s kindred in La
Force! Room for the Bastille prisoner in front there! Save the prisoner
Evremonde at La Force!” and a thousand answering shouts.
He closed the lattice again with a fluttering heart, closed the window
and the curtain, hastened to Lucie, and told her that her father was
assisted by the people, and gone in search of her husband. He found
her child and Miss Pross with her; but, it never occurred to him to be
surprised by their appearance until a long time afterwards, when he sat
watching them in such quiet as the night knew.
Lucie had, by that time, fallen into a stupor on the floor at his feet,
clinging to his hand. Miss Pross had laid the child down on his own
bed, and her head had gradually fallen on the pillow beside her pretty
charge. O the long, long night, with the moans of the poor wife! And
O the long, long night, with no return of her father and no tidings!
Twice more in the darkness the bell at the great gate sounded, and
the irruption was repeated, and the grindstone whirled and spluttered.
“What is it?” cried Lucie, affrighted. “Hush! The soldiers’ swords are
sharpened there,” said Mr. Lorry. “The place is national property now,
and used as a kind of armoury, my love.”
Twice more in all; but, the last spell of work was feeble and fitful.
Soon afterwards the day began to dawn, and he softly detached himself
from the clasping hand, and cautiously looked out again. A man, so
besmeared that he might have been a sorely wounded soldier creeping
back to consciousness on a field of slain, was rising from the pavement
by the side of the grindstone, and looking about him with a vacant air.
Shortly, this worn-out murderer descried in the imperfect light one of
the carriages of Monseigneur, and, staggering to that gorgeous vehicle,
climbed in at the door, and shut himself up to take his rest on its dainty
cushions.
The great grindstone, Earth, had turned when Mr. Lorry looked out
231
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
again, and the sun was red on the courtyard. But, the lesser grindstone
stood alone there in the calm morning air, with a red upon it that the
sun had never given, and would never take away.
Chapter 3
The Shadow
One of the first considerations which arose in the business mind of Mr.
Lorry when business hours came round, was this:—that he had no right
to imperil Tellson’s by sheltering the wife of an emigrant prisoner under
the Bank roof, His own possessions, safety, life, he would have hazarded
for Lucie and her child, without a moment’s demur; but the great trust
he held was not his own, and as to that business charge he was a strict
man of business.
At first, his mind reverted to Defarge, and he thought of finding
out the wine-shop again and taking counsel with its master in reference
to the safest dwelling-place in the distracted state of the city. But, the
same consideration that suggested him, repudiated him; he lived in the
most violent Quarter, and doubtless was influential there, and deep in
its dangerous workings.
Noon coming, and the Doctor not returning, and every minute’s delay tending to compromise Tellson’s, Mr. Lorry advised with Lucie. She
said that her father had spoken of hiring a lodging for a short term, in
that Quarter, near the Banking-house. As there was no business objection to this, and as he foresaw that even if it were all well with Charles,
and he were to be released, he could not hope to leave the city, Mr. Lorry
went out in quest of such a lodging, and found a suitable one, high up
in a removed by-street where the closed blinds in all the other windows
of a high melancholy square of buildings marked deserted homes.
To this lodging he at once removed Lucie and her child, and Miss
Pross: giving them what comfort he could, and much more than he
had himself. He left Jerry with them, as a figure to fill a doorway that
would bear considerable knocking on the head, and retained to his own
occupations. A disturbed and doleful mind he brought to bear upon
them, and slowly and heavily the day lagged on with him.
It wore itself out, and wore him out with it, until the Bank closed.
He was again alone in his room of the previous night, considering what
232
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
to do next, when he heard a foot upon the stair. In a few moments, a
man stood in his presence, who, with a keenly observant look at him,
addressed him by his name.
“Your servant,” said Mr. Lorry. “Do you know me?”
He was a strongly made man with dark curling hair, from forty-five
to fifty years of age. For answer he repeated, without any change of
emphasis, the words:
“Do you know me?”
“I have seen you somewhere.”
“Perhaps at my wine-shop?”
Much interested and agitated, Mr. Lorry said: “You come from Doctor Manette?”
“Yes. I come from Doctor Manette.”
“And what says he? What does he send me?”
Defarge gave into his anxious hand, an open scrap of paper. It bore
the words in the Doctor’s writing:
“Charles is safe, but I cannot safely leave this place yet. I
have obtained the favour that the bearer has a short note
from Charles to his wife. Let the bearer see his wife.”
It was dated from La Force, within an hour.
“Will you accompany me,” said Mr. Lorry, joyfully relieved after
reading this note aloud, “to where his wife resides?”
“Yes,” returned Defarge.
Scarcely noticing as yet, in what a curiously reserved and mechanical
way Defarge spoke, Mr. Lorry put on his hat and they went down into
the courtyard. There, they found two women; one, knitting.
“Madame Defarge, surely!” said Mr. Lorry, who had left her in
exactly the same attitude some seventeen years ago.
“It is she,” observed her husband.
“Does Madame go with us?” inquired Mr. Lorry, seeing that she
moved as they moved.
“Yes. That she may be able to recognise the faces and know the
persons. It is for their safety.”
Beginning to be struck by Defarge’s manner, Mr. Lorry looked dubiously at him, and led the way. Both the women followed; the second
woman being The Vengeance.
They passed through the intervening streets as quickly as they might,
ascended the staircase of the new domicile, were admitted by Jerry, and
233
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
found Lucie weeping, alone. She was thrown into a transport by the
tidings Mr. Lorry gave her of her husband, and clasped the hand that
delivered his note—little thinking what it had been doing near him in
the night, and might, but for a chance, have done to him.
“Dearest,—Take courage. I am well, and your father has
influence around me. You cannot answer this. Kiss our child
for me.”
That was all the writing. It was so much, however, to her who
received it, that she turned from Defarge to his wife, and kissed one of
the hands that knitted. It was a passionate, loving, thankful, womanly
action, but the hand made no response—dropped cold and heavy, and
took to its knitting again.
There was something in its touch that gave Lucie a check. She
stopped in the act of putting the note in her bosom, and, with her hands
yet at her neck, looked terrified at Madame Defarge. Madame Defarge
met the lifted eyebrows and forehead with a cold, impassive stare.
“My dear,” said Mr. Lorry, striking in to explain; “there are frequent
risings in the streets; and, although it is not likely they will ever trouble
you, Madame Defarge wishes to see those whom she has the power to
protect at such times, to the end that she may know them—that she may
identify them. I believe,” said Mr. Lorry, rather halting in his reassuring
words, as the stony manner of all the three impressed itself upon him
more and more, “I state the case, Citizen Defarge?”
Defarge looked gloomily at his wife, and gave no other answer than
a gruff sound of acquiescence.
“You had better, Lucie,” said Mr. Lorry, doing all he could to propitiate, by tone and manner, “have the dear child here, and our good Pross.
Our good Pross, Defarge, is an English lady, and knows no French.”
The lady in question, whose rooted conviction that she was more
than a match for any foreigner, was not to be shaken by distress and,
danger, appeared with folded arms, and observed in English to The
Vengeance, whom her eyes first encountered, “Well, I am sure, Boldface! I hope you are pretty well!” She also bestowed a British cough on
Madame Defarge; but, neither of the two took much heed of her.
“Is that his child?” said Madame Defarge, stopping in her work for
the first time, and pointing her knitting-needle at little Lucie as if it were
the finger of Fate.
234
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
“Yes, madame,” answered Mr. Lorry; “this is our poor prisoner’s
darling daughter, and only child.”
The shadow attendant on Madame Defarge and her party seemed
to fall so threatening and dark on the child, that her mother instinctively kneeled on the ground beside her, and held her to her breast. The
shadow attendant on Madame Defarge and her party seemed then to
fall, threatening and dark, on both the mother and the child.
“It is enough, my husband,” said Madame Defarge. “I have seen
them. We may go.”
But, the suppressed manner had enough of menace in it—not visible
and presented, but indistinct and withheld—to alarm Lucie into saying,
as she laid her appealing hand on Madame Defarge’s dress:
“You will be good to my poor husband. You will do him no harm.
You will help me to see him if you can?”
“Your husband is not my business here,” returned Madame Defarge,
looking down at her with perfect composure. “It is the daughter of your
father who is my business here.”
“For my sake, then, be merciful to my husband. For my child’s sake!
She will put her hands together and pray you to be merciful. We are
more afraid of you than of these others.”
Madame Defarge received it as a compliment, and looked at her
husband. Defarge, who had been uneasily biting his thumb-nail and
looking at her, collected his face into a sterner expression.
“What is it that your husband says in that little letter?” asked
Madame Defarge, with a lowering smile. “Influence; he says something
touching influence?”
“That my father,” said Lucie, hurriedly taking the paper from her
breast, but with her alarmed eyes on her questioner and not on it, “has
much influence around him.”
“Surely it will release him!” said Madame Defarge. “Let it do so.”
“As a wife and mother,” cried Lucie, most earnestly, “I implore you
to have pity on me and not to exercise any power that you possess,
against my innocent husband, but to use it in his behalf. O sister-woman,
think of me. As a wife and mother!”
Madame Defarge looked, coldly as ever, at the suppliant, and said,
turning to her friend The Vengeance:
“The wives and mothers we have been used to see, since we were
as little as this child, and much less, have not been greatly considered?
We have known their husbands and fathers laid in prison and kept from
235
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
them, often enough? All our lives, we have seen our sister-women suffer,
in themselves and in their children, poverty, nakedness, hunger, thirst,
sickness, misery, oppression and neglect of all kinds?”
“We have seen nothing else,” returned The Vengeance.
“We have borne this a long time,” said Madame Defarge, turning
her eyes again upon Lucie. “Judge you! Is it likely that the trouble of
one wife and mother would be much to us now?”
She resumed her knitting and went out. The Vengeance followed.
Defarge went last, and closed the door.
“Courage, my dear Lucie,” said Mr. Lorry, as he raised her.
“Courage, courage! So far all goes well with us—much, much better
than it has of late gone with many poor souls. Cheer up, and have a
thankful heart.”
“I am not thankless, I hope, but that dreadful woman seems to throw
a shadow on me and on all my hopes.”
“Tut, tut!” said Mr. Lorry; “what is this despondency in the brave
little breast? A shadow indeed! No substance in it, Lucie.”
But the shadow of the manner of these Defarges was dark upon
himself, for all that, and in his secret mind it troubled him greatly.
Chapter 4
Calm in Storm
Doctor Manette did not return until the morning of the fourth day of
his absence. So much of what had happened in that dreadful time as
could be kept from the knowledge of Lucie was so well concealed from
her, that not until long afterwards, when France and she were far apart,
did she know that eleven hundred defenceless prisoners of both sexes
and all ages had been killed by the populace; that four days and nights
had been darkened by this deed of horror; and that the air around her
had been tainted by the slain. She only knew that there had been an
attack upon the prisons, that all political prisoners had been in danger,
and that some had been dragged out by the crowd and murdered.
To Mr. Lorry, the Doctor communicated under an injunction of secrecy on which he had no need to dwell, that the crowd had taken him
through a scene of carnage to the prison of La Force. That, in the prison
he had found a self-appointed Tribunal sitting, before which the prison236
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
ers were brought singly, and by which they were rapidly ordered to be
put forth to be massacred, or to be released, or (in a few cases) to be sent
back to their cells. That, presented by his conductors to this Tribunal,
he had announced himself by name and profession as having been for
eighteen years a secret and unaccused prisoner in the Bastille; that, one
of the body so sitting in judgment had risen and identified him, and that
this man was Defarge.
That, hereupon he had ascertained, through the registers on the table, that his son-in-law was among the living prisoners, and had pleaded
hard to the Tribunal—of whom some members were asleep and some
awake, some dirty with murder and some clean, some sober and some
not—for his life and liberty. That, in the first frantic greetings lavished
on himself as a notable sufferer under the overthrown system, it had
been accorded to him to have Charles Darnay brought before the lawless Court, and examined. That, he seemed on the point of being at
once released, when the tide in his favour met with some unexplained
check (not intelligible to the Doctor), which led to a few words of secret conference. That, the man sitting as President had then informed
Doctor Manette that the prisoner must remain in custody, but should,
for his sake, be held inviolate in safe custody. That, immediately, on
a signal, the prisoner was removed to the interior of the prison again;
but, that he, the Doctor, had then so strongly pleaded for permission to
remain and assure himself that his son-in-law was, through no malice
or mischance, delivered to the concourse whose murderous yells outside
the gate had often drowned the proceedings, that he had obtained the
permission, and had remained in that Hall of Blood until the danger
was over.
The sights he had seen there, with brief snatches of food and sleep by
intervals, shall remain untold. The mad joy over the prisoners who were
saved, had astounded him scarcely less than the mad ferocity against
those who were cut to pieces. One prisoner there was, he said, who
had been discharged into the street free, but at whom a mistaken savage
had thrust a pike as he passed out. Being besought to go to him and
dress the wound, the Doctor had passed out at the same gate, and had
found him in the arms of a company of Samaritans, who were seated
on the bodies of their victims. With an inconsistency as monstrous as
anything in this awful nightmare, they had helped the healer, and tended
the wounded man with the gentlest solicitude—had made a litter for
him and escorted him carefully from the spot—had then caught up their
237
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
weapons and plunged anew into a butchery so dreadful, that the Doctor
had covered his eyes with his hands, and swooned away in the midst of
it.
As Mr. Lorry received these confidences, and as he watched the face
of his friend now sixty-two years of age, a misgiving arose within him
that such dread experiences would revive the old danger.
But, he had never seen his friend in his present aspect: he had never
at all known him in his present character. For the first time the Doctor
felt, now, that his suffering was strength and power. For the first time
he felt that in that sharp fire, he had slowly forged the iron which could
break the prison door of his daughter’s husband, and deliver him. “It
all tended to a good end, my friend; it was not mere waste and ruin. As
my beloved child was helpful in restoring me to myself, I will be helpful
now in restoring the dearest part of herself to her; by the aid of Heaven
I will do it!” Thus, Doctor Manette. And when Jarvis Lorry saw the
kindled eyes, the resolute face, the calm strong look and bearing of the
man whose life always seemed to him to have been stopped, like a clock,
for so many years, and then set going again with an energy which had
lain dormant during the cessation of its usefulness, he believed.
Greater things than the Doctor had at that time to contend with,
would have yielded before his persevering purpose. While he kept himself in his place, as a physician, whose business was with all degrees of
mankind, bond and free, rich and poor, bad and good, he used his personal influence so wisely, that he was soon the inspecting physician of
three prisons, and among them of La Force. He could now assure Lucie
that her husband was no longer confined alone, but was mixed with
the general body of prisoners; he saw her husband weekly, and brought
sweet messages to her, straight from his lips; sometimes her husband
himself sent a letter to her (though never by the Doctor’s hand), but she
was not permitted to write to him: for, among the many wild suspicions
of plots in the prisons, the wildest of all pointed at emigrants who were
known to have made friends or permanent connections abroad.
This new life of the Doctor’s was an anxious life, no doubt; still,
the sagacious Mr. Lorry saw that there was a new sustaining pride in it.
Nothing unbecoming tinged the pride; it was a natural and worthy one;
but he observed it as a curiosity. The Doctor knew, that up to that time,
his imprisonment had been associated in the minds of his daughter and
his friend, with his personal affliction, deprivation, and weakness. Now
that this was changed, and he knew himself to be invested through that
238
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
old trial with forces to which they both looked for Charles’s ultimate
safety and deliverance, he became so far exalted by the change, that he
took the lead and direction, and required them as the weak, to trust to
him as the strong. The preceding relative positions of himself and Lucie were reversed, yet only as the liveliest gratitude and affection could
reverse them, for he could have had no pride but in rendering some
service to her who had rendered so much to him. “All curious to see,”
thought Mr. Lorry, in his amiably shrewd way, “but all natural and
right; so, take the lead, my dear friend, and keep it; it couldn’t be in
better hands.”
But, though the Doctor tried hard, and never ceased trying, to get
Charles Darnay set at liberty, or at least to get him brought to trial, the
public current of the time set too strong and fast for him. The new era
began; the king was tried, doomed, and beheaded; the Republic of Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death, declared for victory or death against
the world in arms; the black flag waved night and day from the great
towers of Notre Dame; three hundred thousand men, summoned to rise
against the tyrants of the earth, rose from all the varying soils of France,
as if the dragon’s teeth had been sown broadcast, and had yielded fruit
equally on hill and plain, on rock, in gravel, and alluvial mud, under the
bright sky of the South and under the clouds of the North, in fell and
forest, in the vineyards and the olive-grounds and among the cropped
grass and the stubble of the corn, along the fruitful banks of the broad
rivers, and in the sand of the sea-shore. What private solicitude could
rear itself against the deluge of the Year One of Liberty—the deluge
rising from below, not falling from above, and with the windows of
Heaven shut, not opened!
There was no pause, no pity, no peace, no interval of relenting rest,
no measurement of time. Though days and nights circled as regularly as
when time was young, and the evening and morning were the first day,
other count of time there was none. Hold of it was lost in the raging
fever of a nation, as it is in the fever of one patient. Now, breaking the
unnatural silence of a whole city, the executioner showed the people the
head of the king—and now, it seemed almost in the same breath, the
head of his fair wife which had had eight weary months of imprisoned
widowhood and misery, to turn it grey.
And yet, observing the strange law of contradiction which obtains
in all such cases, the time was long, while it flamed by so fast. A revolutionary tribunal in the capital, and forty or fifty thousand revolutionary
239
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
committees all over the land; a law of the Suspected, which struck away
all security for liberty or life, and delivered over any good and innocent
person to any bad and guilty one; prisons gorged with people who had
committed no offence, and could obtain no hearing; these things became
the established order and nature of appointed things, and seemed to be
ancient usage before they were many weeks old. Above all, one hideous
figure grew as familiar as if it had been before the general gaze from
the foundations of the world—the figure of the sharp female called La
Guillotine.
It was the popular theme for jests; it was the best cure for headache,
it infallibly prevented the hair from turning grey, it imparted a peculiar
delicacy to the complexion, it was the National Razor which shaved
close: who kissed La Guillotine, looked through the little window and
sneezed into the sack. It was the sign of the regeneration of the human
race. It superseded the Cross. Models of it were worn on breasts from
which the Cross was discarded, and it was bowed down to and believed
in where the Cross was denied.
It sheared off heads so many, that it, and the ground it most polluted, were a rotten red. It was taken to pieces, like a toy-puzzle for a
young Devil, and was put together again when the occasion wanted it. It
hushed the eloquent, struck down the powerful, abolished the beautiful
and good. Twenty-two friends of high public mark, twenty-one living
and one dead, it had lopped the heads off, in one morning, in as many
minutes. The name of the strong man of Old Scripture had descended
to the chief functionary who worked it; but, so armed, he was stronger
than his namesake, and blinder, and tore away the gates of God’s own
Temple every day.
Among these terrors, and the brood belonging to them, the Doctor
walked with a steady head: confident in his power, cautiously persistent
in his end, never doubting that he would save Lucie’s husband at last.
Yet the current of the time swept by, so strong and deep, and carried
the time away so fiercely, that Charles had lain in prison one year and
three months when the Doctor was thus steady and confident. So much
more wicked and distracted had the Revolution grown in that December
month, that the rivers of the South were encumbered with the bodies of
the violently drowned by night, and prisoners were shot in lines and
squares under the southern wintry sun. Still, the Doctor walked among
the terrors with a steady head. No man better known than he, in Paris at
that day; no man in a stranger situation. Silent, humane, indispensable
240
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
in hospital and prison, using his art equally among assassins and victims,
he was a man apart. In the exercise of his skill, the appearance and the
story of the Bastille Captive removed him from all other men. He was
not suspected or brought in question, any more than if he had indeed
been recalled to life some eighteen years before, or were a Spirit moving
among mortals.
Chapter 5
The Wood-Sawyer
One year and three months. During all that time Lucie was never sure,
from hour to hour, but that the Guillotine would strike off her husband’s head next day. Every day, through the stony streets, the tumbrils
now jolted heavily, filled with Condemned. Lovely girls; bright women,
brown-haired, black-haired, and grey; youths; stalwart men and old;
gentle born and peasant born; all red wine for La Guillotine, all daily
brought into light from the dark cellars of the loathsome prisons, and
carried to her through the streets to slake her devouring thirst. Liberty,
equality, fraternity, or death;—the last, much the easiest to bestow, O
Guillotine!
If the suddenness of her calamity, and the whirling wheels of the
time, had stunned the Doctor’s daughter into awaiting the result in idle
despair, it would but have been with her as it was with many. But, from
the hour when she had taken the white head to her fresh young bosom
in the garret of Saint Antoine, she had been true to her duties. She was
truest to them in the season of trial, as all the quietly loyal and good
will always be.
As soon as they were established in their new residence, and her father had entered on the routine of his avocations, she arranged the little
household as exactly as if her husband had been there. Everything had
its appointed place and its appointed time. Little Lucie she taught, as
regularly, as if they had all been united in their English home. The slight
devices with which she cheated herself into the show of a belief that
they would soon be reunited—the little preparations for his speedy return, the setting aside of his chair and his books—these, and the solemn
prayer at night for one dear prisoner especially, among the many un241
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
happy souls in prison and the shadow of death—were almost the only
outspoken reliefs of her heavy mind.
She did not greatly alter in appearance. The plain dark dresses, akin
to mourning dresses, which she and her child wore, were as neat and
as well attended to as the brighter clothes of happy days. She lost her
colour, and the old and intent expression was a constant, not an occasional, thing; otherwise, she remained very pretty and comely. Sometimes, at night on kissing her father, she would burst into the grief
she had repressed all day, and would say that her sole reliance, under
Heaven, was on him. He always resolutely answered: “Nothing can
happen to him without my knowledge, and I know that I can save him,
Lucie.”
They had not made the round of their changed life many weeks,
when her father said to her, on coming home one evening:
“My dear, there is an upper window in the prison, to which Charles
can sometimes gain access at three in the afternoon. When he can get to
it—which depends on many uncertainties and incidents—he might see
you in the street, he thinks, if you stood in a certain place that I can
show you. But you will not be able to see him, my poor child, and even
if you could, it would be unsafe for you to make a sign of recognition.”
“O show me the place, my father, and I will go there every day.”
From that time, in all weathers, she waited there two hours. As the
clock struck two, she was there, and at four she turned resignedly away.
When it was not too wet or inclement for her child to be with her, they
went together; at other times she was alone; but, she never missed a
single day.
It was the dark and dirty corner of a small winding street. The hovel
of a cutter of wood into lengths for burning, was the only house at that
end; all else was wall. On the third day of her being there, he noticed
her.
“Good day, citizeness.”
“Good day, citizen.”
This mode of address was now prescribed by decree. It had been established voluntarily some time ago, among the more thorough patriots;
but, was now law for everybody.
“Walking here again, citizeness?”
“You see me, citizen!”
The wood-sawyer, who was a little man with a redundancy of gesture (he had once been a mender of roads), cast a glance at the prison,

pointed at the prison, and putting his ten fingers before his face to represent bars, peeped through them jocosely.
“But it’s not my business,” said he. And went on sawing his wood.
Next day he was looking out for her, and accosted her the moment
she appeared.
“What? Walking here again, citizeness?”
“Yes, citizen.”
“Ah! A child too! Your mother, is it not, my little citizeness?”
“Do I say yes, mamma?” whispered little Lucie, drawing close to
her.
“Yes, dearest.”
“Yes, citizen.”
“Ah! But it’s not my business. My work is my business. See my
saw! I call it my Little Guillotine. La, la, la; La, la, la! And off his head
comes!”
The billet fell as he spoke, and he threw it into a basket.
“I call myself the Samson of the firewood guillotine. See here again!
Loo, loo, loo; Loo, loo, loo! And off her head comes! Now, a child.
Tickle, tickle; Pickle, pickle! And off its head comes. All the family!”
Lucie shuddered as he threw two more billets into his basket, but it
was impossible to be there while the wood-sawyer was at work, and not
be in his sight. Thenceforth, to secure his good will, she always spoke
to him first, and often gave him drink-money, which he readily received.
He was an inquisitive fellow, and sometimes when she had quite
forgotten him in gazing at the prison roof and grates, and in lifting her
heart up to her husband, she would come to herself to find him looking
at her, with his knee on his bench and his saw stopped in its work. “But
it’s not my business!” he would generally say at those times, and would
briskly fall to his sawing again.
In all weathers, in the snow and frost of winter, in the bitter winds
of spring, in the hot sunshine of summer, in the rains of autumn, and
again in the snow and frost of winter, Lucie passed two hours of every
day at this place; and every day on leaving it, she kissed the prison wall.
Her husband saw her (so she learned from her father) it might be once
in five or six times: it might be twice or thrice running: it might be, not
for a week or a fortnight together. It was enough that he could and did
see her when the chances served, and on that possibility she would have
waited out the day, seven days a week.
These occupations brought her round to the December month,
243
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
wherein her father walked among the terrors with a steady head. On
a lightly-snowing afternoon she arrived at the usual corner. It was a
day of some wild rejoicing, and a festival. She had seen the houses,
as she came along, decorated with little pikes, and with little red caps
stuck upon them; also, with tricoloured ribbons; also, with the standard inscription (tricoloured letters were the favourite), Republic One
and Indivisible. Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death!
The miserable shop of the wood-sawyer was so small, that its whole
surface furnished very indifferent space for this legend. He had got
somebody to scrawl it up for him, however, who had squeezed Death
in with most inappropriate difficulty. On his house-top, he displayed
pike and cap, as a good citizen must, and in a window he had stationed
his saw inscribed as his “Little Sainte Guillotine”—for the great sharp
female was by that time popularly canonised. His shop was shut and he
was not there, which was a relief to Lucie, and left her quite alone.
But, he was not far off, for presently she heard a troubled movement
and a shouting coming along, which filled her with fear. A moment afterwards, and a throng of people came pouring round the corner by the
prison wall, in the midst of whom was the wood-sawyer hand in hand
with The Vengeance. There could not be fewer than five hundred people,
and they were dancing like five thousand demons. There was no other
music than their own singing. They danced to the popular Revolution
song, keeping a ferocious time that was like a gnashing of teeth in unison. Men and women danced together, women danced together, men
danced together, as hazard had brought them together. At first, they
were a mere storm of coarse red caps and coarse woollen rags; but, as
they filled the place, and stopped to dance about Lucie, some ghastly
apparition of a dance-figure gone raving mad arose among them. They
advanced, retreated, struck at one another’s hands, clutched at one another’s heads, spun round alone, caught one another and spun round
in pairs, until many of them dropped. While those were down, the rest
linked hand in hand, and all spun round together: then the ring broke,
and in separate rings of two and four they turned and turned until they
all stopped at once, began again, struck, clutched, and tore, and then reversed the spin, and all spun round another way. Suddenly they stopped
again, paused, struck out the time afresh, formed into lines the width
of the public way, and, with their heads low down and their hands high
up, swooped screaming off. No fight could have been half so terrible
as this dance. It was so emphatically a fallen sport—a something, once
244
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
innocent, delivered over to all devilry—a healthy pastime changed into
a means of angering the blood, bewildering the senses, and steeling the
heart. Such grace as was visible in it, made it the uglier, showing how
warped and perverted all things good by nature were become. The maidenly bosom bared to this, the pretty almost-child’s head thus distracted,
the delicate foot mincing in this slough of blood and dirt, were types of
the disjointed time.
This was the Carmagnole. As it passed, leaving Lucie frightened and
bewildered in the doorway of the wood-sawyer’s house, the feathery
snow fell as quietly and lay as white and soft, as if it had never been.
“O my father!” for he stood before her when she lifted up the eyes
she had momentarily darkened with her hand; “such a cruel, bad sight.”
“I know, my dear, I know. I have seen it many times. Don’t be
frightened! Not one of them would harm you.”
“I am not frightened for myself, my father. But when I think of my
husband, and the mercies of these people—”
“We will set him above their mercies very soon. I left him climbing
to the window, and I came to tell you. There is no one here to see. You
may kiss your hand towards that highest shelving roof.”
“I do so, father, and I send him my Soul with it!”
“You cannot see him, my poor dear?”
“No, father,” said Lucie, yearning and weeping as she kissed her
hand, “no.”
A footstep in the snow. Madame Defarge. “I salute you, citizeness,”
from the Doctor. “I salute you, citizen.” This in passing. Nothing more.
Madame Defarge gone, like a shadow over the white road.
“Give me your arm, my love. Pass from here with an air of cheerfulness and courage, for his sake. That was well done;” they had left the
spot; “it shall not be in vain. Charles is summoned for to-morrow.”
“For to-morrow!”
“There is no time to lose. I am well prepared, but there are precautions to be taken, that could not be taken until he was actually summoned before the Tribunal. He has not received the notice yet, but I
know that he will presently be summoned for to-morrow, and removed
to the Conciergerie; I have timely information. You are not afraid?”
She could scarcely answer, “I trust in you.”
“Do so, implicitly. Your suspense is nearly ended, my darling; he
shall be restored to you within a few hours; I have encompassed him
with every protection. I must see Lorry.”
245
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
He stopped. There was a heavy lumbering of wheels within hearing.
They both knew too well what it meant. One. Two. Three. Three
tumbrils faring away with their dread loads over the hushing snow.
“I must see Lorry,” the Doctor repeated, turning her another way.
The staunch old gentleman was still in his trust; had never left it. He
and his books were in frequent requisition as to property confiscated
and made national. What he could save for the owners, he saved. No
better man living to hold fast by what Tellson’s had in keeping, and to
hold his peace.
A murky red and yellow sky, and a rising mist from the Seine, denoted the approach of darkness. It was almost dark when they arrived at
the Bank. The stately residence of Monseigneur was altogether blighted
and deserted. Above a heap of dust and ashes in the court, ran the letters: National Property. Republic One and Indivisible. Liberty, Equality,
Fraternity, or Death!
Who could that be with Mr. Lorry—the owner of the riding-coat
upon the chair—who must not be seen? From whom newly arrived, did
he come out, agitated and surprised, to take his favourite in his arms?
To whom did he appear to repeat her faltering words, when, raising his
voice and turning his head towards the door of the room from which he
had issued, he said: “Removed to the Conciergerie, and summoned for
to-morrow?”
Chapter 6
Triumph
The dread tribunal of five Judges, Public Prosecutor, and determined
Jury, sat every day. Their lists went forth every evening, and were read
out by the gaolers of the various prisons to their prisoners. The standard
gaoler-joke was, “Come out and listen to the Evening Paper, you inside
there!”
“Charles Evremonde, called Darnay!”
So at last began the Evening Paper at La Force.
When a name was called, its owner stepped apart into a spot reserved for those who were announced as being thus fatally recorded.
Charles Evremonde, called Darnay, had reason to know the usage; he
had seen hundreds pass away so.
246
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
His bloated gaoler, who wore spectacles to read with, glanced over
them to assure himself that he had taken his place, and went through
the list, making a similar short pause at each name. There were twentythree names, but only twenty were responded to; for one of the prisoners so summoned had died in gaol and been forgotten, and two had
already been guillotined and forgotten. The list was read, in the vaulted
chamber where Darnay had seen the associated prisoners on the night
of his arrival. Every one of those had perished in the massacre; every
human creature he had since cared for and parted with, had died on the
scaffold.
There were hurried words of farewell and kindness, but the parting
was soon over. It was the incident of every day, and the society of La
Force were engaged in the preparation of some games of forfeits and
a little concert, for that evening. They crowded to the grates and shed
tears there; but, twenty places in the projected entertainments had to
be refilled, and the time was, at best, short to the lock-up hour, when
the common rooms and corridors would be delivered over to the great
dogs who kept watch there through the night. The prisoners were far
from insensible or unfeeling; their ways arose out of the condition of the
time. Similarly, though with a subtle difference, a species of fervour or
intoxication, known, without doubt, to have led some persons to brave
the guillotine unnecessarily, and to die by it, was not mere boastfulness,
but a wild infection of the wildly shaken public mind. In seasons of
pestilence, some of us will have a secret attraction to the disease—a
terrible passing inclination to die of it. And all of us have like wonders
hidden in our breasts, only needing circumstances to evoke them.
The passage to the Conciergerie was short and dark; the night in
its vermin-haunted cells was long and cold. Next day, fifteen prisoners
were put to the bar before Charles Darnay’s name was called. All the
fifteen were condemned, and the trials of the whole occupied an hour
and a half.
“Charles Evremonde, called Darnay,” was at length arraigned.
His judges sat upon the Bench in feathered hats; but the rough red
cap and tricoloured cockade was the head-dress otherwise prevailing.
Looking at the Jury and the turbulent audience, he might have thought
that the usual order of things was reversed, and that the felons were
trying the honest men. The lowest, cruelest, and worst populace of a
city, never without its quantity of low, cruel, and bad, were the directing spirits of the scene: noisily commenting, applauding, disapproving,
247
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
anticipating, and precipitating the result, without a check. Of the men,
the greater part were armed in various ways; of the women, some wore
knives, some daggers, some ate and drank as they looked on, many knitted. Among these last, was one, with a spare piece of knitting under her
arm as she worked. She was in a front row, by the side of a man whom
he had never seen since his arrival at the Barrier, but whom he directly
remembered as Defarge. He noticed that she once or twice whispered in
his ear, and that she seemed to be his wife; but, what he most noticed in
the two figures was, that although they were posted as close to himself
as they could be, they never looked towards him. They seemed to be
waiting for something with a dogged determination, and they looked at
the Jury, but at nothing else. Under the President sat Doctor Manette,
in his usual quiet dress. As well as the prisoner could see, he and Mr.
Lorry were the only men there, unconnected with the Tribunal, who
wore their usual clothes, and had not assumed the coarse garb of the
Carmagnole.
Charles Evremonde, called Darnay, was accused by the public prosecutor as an emigrant, whose life was forfeit to the Republic, under the
decree which banished all emigrants on pain of Death. It was nothing
that the decree bore date since his return to France. There he was, and
there was the decree; he had been taken in France, and his head was
demanded.
“Take off his head!” cried the audience. “An enemy to the Republic!”
The President rang his bell to silence those cries, and asked the prisoner whether it was not true that he had lived many years in England?
Undoubtedly it was.
Was he not an emigrant then? What did he call himself?
Not an emigrant, he hoped, within the sense and spirit of the law.
Why not? the President desired to know.
Because he had voluntarily relinquished a title that was distasteful to
him, and a station that was distasteful to him, and had left his country—
he submitted before the word emigrant in the present acceptation by the
Tribunal was in use—to live by his own industry in England, rather than
on the industry of the overladen people of France.
What proof had he of this?
He handed in the names of two witnesses; Theophile Gabelle, and
Alexandre Manette.
But he had married in England? the President reminded him.
248
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
True, but not an English woman.
A citizeness of France?
Yes. By birth.
Her name and family?
“Lucie Manette, only daughter of Doctor Manette, the good physician who sits there.”
This answer had a happy effect upon the audience. Cries in exaltation of the well-known good physician rent the hall. So capriciously
were the people moved, that tears immediately rolled down several ferocious countenances which had been glaring at the prisoner a moment
before, as if with impatience to pluck him out into the streets and kill
him.
On these few steps of his dangerous way, Charles Darnay had set his
foot according to Doctor Manette’s reiterated instructions. The same
cautious counsel directed every step that lay before him, and had prepared every inch of his road.
The President asked, why had he returned to France when he did,
and not sooner?
He had not returned sooner, he replied, simply because he had no
means of living in France, save those he had resigned; whereas, in England, he lived by giving instruction in the French language and literature.
He had returned when he did, on the pressing and written entreaty of
a French citizen, who represented that his life was endangered by his
absence. He had come back, to save a citizen’s life, and to bear his testimony, at whatever personal hazard, to the truth. Was that criminal in
the eyes of the Republic?
The populace cried enthusiastically, “No!” and the President rang
his bell to quiet them. Which it did not, for they continued to cry “No!”
until they left off, of their own will.
The President required the name of that citizen. The accused explained that the citizen was his first witness. He also referred with confidence to the citizen’s letter, which had been taken from him at the
Barrier, but which he did not doubt would be found among the papers
then before the President.
The Doctor had taken care that it should be there—had assured him
that it would be there—and at this stage of the proceedings it was produced and read. Citizen Gabelle was called to confirm it, and did so.
Citizen Gabelle hinted, with infinite delicacy and politeness, that in the
pressure of business imposed on the Tribunal by the multitude of en249
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
emies of the Republic with which it had to deal, he had been slightly
overlooked in his prison of the Abbaye—in fact, had rather passed out
of the Tribunal’s patriotic remembrance—until three days ago; when he
had been summoned before it, and had been set at liberty on the Jury’s
declaring themselves satisfied that the accusation against him was answered, as to himself, by the surrender of the citizen Evremonde, called
Darnay.
Doctor Manette was next questioned. His high personal popularity,
and the clearness of his answers, made a great impression; but, as he proceeded, as he showed that the Accused was his first friend on his release
from his long imprisonment; that, the accused had remained in England,
always faithful and devoted to his daughter and himself in their exile;
that, so far from being in favour with the Aristocrat government there,
he had actually been tried for his life by it, as the foe of England and
friend of the United States—as he brought these circumstances into view,
with the greatest discretion and with the straightforward force of truth
and earnestness, the Jury and the populace became one. At last, when
he appealed by name to Monsieur Lorry, an English gentleman then and
there present, who, like himself, had been a witness on that English trial
and could corroborate his account of it, the Jury declared that they had
heard enough, and that they were ready with their votes if the President
were content to receive them.
At every vote (the Jurymen voted aloud and individually), the populace set up a shout of applause. All the voices were in the prisoner’s
favour, and the President declared him free.
Then, began one of those extraordinary scenes with which the populace sometimes gratified their fickleness, or their better impulses towards
generosity and mercy, or which they regarded as some set-off against
their swollen account of cruel rage. No man can decide now to which
of these motives such extraordinary scenes were referable; it is probable,
to a blending of all the three, with the second predominating. No sooner
was the acquittal pronounced, than tears were shed as freely as blood
at another time, and such fraternal embraces were bestowed upon the
prisoner by as many of both sexes as could rush at him, that after his
long and unwholesome confinement he was in danger of fainting from
exhaustion; none the less because he knew very well, that the very same
people, carried by another current, would have rushed at him with the
very same intensity, to rend him to pieces and strew him over the streets.
His removal, to make way for other accused persons who were to
250
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
be tried, rescued him from these caresses for the moment. Five were
to be tried together, next, as enemies of the Republic, forasmuch as
they had not assisted it by word or deed. So quick was the Tribunal to
compensate itself and the nation for a chance lost, that these five came
down to him before he left the place, condemned to die within twentyfour hours. The first of them told him so, with the customary prison
sign of Death—a raised finger—and they all added in words, “Long live
the Republic!”
The five had had, it is true, no audience to lengthen their proceedings,
for when he and Doctor Manette emerged from the gate, there was a
great crowd about it, in which there seemed to be every face he had seen
in Court—except two, for which he looked in vain. On his coming out,
the concourse made at him anew, weeping, embracing, and shouting, all
by turns and all together, until the very tide of the river on the bank of
which the mad scene was acted, seemed to run mad, like the people on
the shore.
They put him into a great chair they had among them, and which
they had taken either out of the Court itself, or one of its rooms or
passages. Over the chair they had thrown a red flag, and to the back of
it they had bound a pike with a red cap on its top. In this car of triumph,
not even the Doctor’s entreaties could prevent his being carried to his
home on men’s shoulders, with a confused sea of red caps heaving about
him, and casting up to sight from the stormy deep such wrecks of faces,
that he more than once misdoubted his mind being in confusion, and
that he was in the tumbril on his way to the Guillotine.
In wild dreamlike procession, embracing whom they met and pointing him out, they carried him on. Reddening the snowy streets with the
prevailing Republican colour, in winding and tramping through them,
as they had reddened them below the snow with a deeper dye, they carried him thus into the courtyard of the building where he lived. Her
father had gone on before, to prepare her, and when her husband stood
upon his feet, she dropped insensible in his arms.
As he held her to his heart and turned her beautiful head between
his face and the brawling crowd, so that his tears and her lips might
come together unseen, a few of the people fell to dancing. Instantly, all
the rest fell to dancing, and the courtyard overflowed with the Carmagnole. Then, they elevated into the vacant chair a young woman from
the crowd to be carried as the Goddess of Liberty, and then swelling and
overflowing out into the adjacent streets, and along the river’s bank, and
251
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
over the bridge, the Carmagnole absorbed them every one and whirled
them away.
After grasping the Doctor’s hand, as he stood victorious and proud
before him; after grasping the hand of Mr. Lorry, who came panting in
breathless from his struggle against the waterspout of the Carmagnole;
after kissing little Lucie, who was lifted up to clasp her arms round his
neck; and after embracing the ever zealous and faithful Pross who lifted
her; he took his wife in his arms, and carried her up to their rooms.
“Lucie! My own! I am safe.”
“O dearest Charles, let me thank God for this on my knees as I have
prayed to Him.”
They all reverently bowed their heads and hearts. When she was
again in his arms, he said to her:
“And now speak to your father, dearest. No other man in all this
France could have done what he has done for me.”
She laid her head upon her father’s breast, as she had laid his poor
head on her own breast, long, long ago. He was happy in the return
he had made her, he was recompensed for his suffering, he was proud
of his strength. “You must not be weak, my darling,” he remonstrated;
“don’t tremble so. I have saved him.”
Chapter 7
A Knock at the Door
“I have saved him.” It was not another of the dreams in which he had
often come back; he was really here. And yet his wife trembled, and a
vague but heavy fear was upon her.
All the air round was so thick and dark, the people were so passionately revengeful and fitful, the innocent were so constantly put to death
on vague suspicion and black malice, it was so impossible to forget that
many as blameless as her husband and as dear to others as he was to
her, every day shared the fate from which he had been clutched, that her
heart could not be as lightened of its load as she felt it ought to be. The
shadows of the wintry afternoon were beginning to fall, and even now
the dreadful carts were rolling through the streets. Her mind pursued
them, looking for him among the Condemned; and then she clung closer
to his real presence and trembled more.
252
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
Her father, cheering her, showed a compassionate superiority to this
woman’s weakness, which was wonderful to see. No garret, no shoemaking, no One Hundred and Five, North Tower, now! He had accomplished the task he had set himself, his promise was redeemed, he had
saved Charles. Let them all lean upon him.
Their housekeeping was of a very frugal kind: not only because that
was the safest way of life, involving the least offence to the people, but
because they were not rich, and Charles, throughout his imprisonment,
had had to pay heavily for his bad food, and for his guard, and towards
the living of the poorer prisoners. Partly on this account, and partly
to avoid a domestic spy, they kept no servant; the citizen and citizeness
who acted as porters at the courtyard gate, rendered them occasional
service; and Jerry (almost wholly transferred to them by Mr. Lorry) had
become their daily retainer, and had his bed there every night.
It was an ordinance of the Republic One and Indivisible of Liberty,
Equality, Fraternity, or Death, that on the door or doorpost of every
house, the name of every inmate must be legibly inscribed in letters
of a certain size, at a certain convenient height from the ground. Mr.
Jerry Cruncher’s name, therefore, duly embellished the doorpost down
below; and, as the afternoon shadows deepened, the owner of that name
himself appeared, from overlooking a painter whom Doctor Manette
had employed to add to the list the name of Charles Evremonde, called
Darnay.
In the universal fear and distrust that darkened the time, all the usual
harmless ways of life were changed. In the Doctor’s little household, as
in very many others, the articles of daily consumption that were wanted
were purchased every evening, in small quantities and at various small
shops. To avoid attracting notice, and to give as little occasion as possible for talk and envy, was the general desire.
For some months past, Miss Pross and Mr. Cruncher had discharged
the office of purveyors; the former carrying the money; the latter, the
basket. Every afternoon at about the time when the public lamps were
lighted, they fared forth on this duty, and made and brought home such
purchases as were needful. Although Miss Pross, through her long association with a French family, might have known as much of their
language as of her own, if she had had a mind, she had no mind in that
direction; consequently she knew no more of that “nonsense” (as she
was pleased to call it) than Mr. Cruncher did. So her manner of marketing was to plump a noun-substantive at the head of a shopkeeper
253
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
without any introduction in the nature of an article, and, if it happened
not to be the name of the thing she wanted, to look round for that thing,
lay hold of it, and hold on by it until the bargain was concluded. She
always made a bargain for it, by holding up, as a statement of its just
price, one finger less than the merchant held up, whatever his number
might be.
“Now, Mr. Cruncher,” said Miss Pross, whose eyes were red with
felicity; “if you are ready, I am.”
Jerry hoarsely professed himself at Miss Pross’s service. He had
worn all his rust off long ago, but nothing would file his spiky head
down.
“There’s all manner of things wanted,” said Miss Pross, “and we
shall have a precious time of it. We want wine, among the rest. Nice
toasts these Redheads will be drinking, wherever we buy it.”
“It will be much the same to your knowledge, miss, I should think,”
retorted Jerry, “whether they drink your health or the Old Un’s.”
“Who’s he?” said Miss Pross.
Mr. Cruncher, with some diffidence, explained himself as meaning
“Old Nick’s.”
“Ha!” said Miss Pross, “it doesn’t need an interpreter to explain
the meaning of these creatures. They have but one, and it’s Midnight
Murder, and Mischief.”
“Hush, dear! Pray, pray, be cautious!” cried Lucie.
“Yes, yes, yes, I’ll be cautious,” said Miss Pross; “but I may say
among ourselves, that I do hope there will be no oniony and tobaccoey
smotherings in the form of embracings all round, going on in the streets.
Now, Ladybird, never you stir from that fire till I come back! Take care
of the dear husband you have recovered, and don’t move your pretty
head from his shoulder as you have it now, till you see me again! May I
ask a question, Doctor Manette, before I go?”
“I think you may take that liberty,” the Doctor answered, smiling.
“For gracious sake, don’t talk about Liberty; we have quite enough
of that,” said Miss Pross.
“Hush, dear! Again?” Lucie remonstrated.
“Well, my sweet,” said Miss Pross, nodding her head emphatically,
“the short and the long of it is, that I am a subject of His Most Gracious Majesty King George the Third;” Miss Pross curtseyed at the
name; “and as such, my maxim is, Confound their politics, Frustrate
their knavish tricks, On him our hopes we fix, God save the King!”
254
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
Mr. Cruncher, in an access of loyalty, growlingly repeated the words
after Miss Pross, like somebody at church.
“I am glad you have so much of the Englishman in you, though
I wish you had never taken that cold in your voice,” said Miss Pross,
approvingly. “But the question, Doctor Manette. Is there”—it was the
good creature’s way to affect to make light of anything that was a great
anxiety with them all, and to come at it in this chance manner—“is there
any prospect yet, of our getting out of this place?”
“I fear not yet. It would be dangerous for Charles yet.”
“Heigh-ho-hum!” said Miss Pross, cheerfully repressing a sigh as
she glanced at her darling’s golden hair in the light of the fire, “then we
must have patience and wait: that’s all. We must hold up our heads and
fight low, as my brother Solomon used to say. Now, Mr. Cruncher!—
Don’t you move, Ladybird!”
They went out, leaving Lucie, and her husband, her father, and the
child, by a bright fire. Mr. Lorry was expected back presently from the
Banking House. Miss Pross had lighted the lamp, but had put it aside
in a corner, that they might enjoy the fire-light undisturbed. Little Lucie
sat by her grandfather with her hands clasped through his arm: and he,
in a tone not rising much above a whisper, began to tell her a story of
a great and powerful Fairy who had opened a prison-wall and let out
a captive who had once done the Fairy a service. All was subdued and
quiet, and Lucie was more at ease than she had been.
“What is that?” she cried, all at once.
“My dear!” said her father, stopping in his story, and laying his
hand on hers, “command yourself. What a disordered state you are in!
The least thing—nothing—startles you! You, your father’s daughter!”
“I thought, my father,” said Lucie, excusing herself, with a pale face
and in a faltering voice, “that I heard strange feet upon the stairs.”
“My love, the staircase is as still as Death.”
As he said the word, a blow was struck upon the door.
“Oh father, father. What can this be! Hide Charles. Save him!”
“My child,” said the Doctor, rising, and laying his hand upon her
shoulder, “I have saved him. What weakness is this, my dear! Let me
go to the door.”
He took the lamp in his hand, crossed the two intervening outer
rooms, and opened it. A rude clattering of feet over the floor, and four
rough men in red caps, armed with sabres and pistols, entered the room.
“The Citizen Evremonde, called Darnay,” said the first.
255
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
“Who seeks him?” answered Darnay.
“I seek him. We seek him. I know you, Evremonde; I saw you before
the Tribunal to-day. You are again the prisoner of the Republic.”
The four surrounded him, where he stood with his wife and child
clinging to him.
“Tell me how and why am I again a prisoner?”
“It is enough that you return straight to the Conciergerie, and will
know to-morrow. You are summoned for to-morrow.”
Doctor Manette, whom this visitation had so turned into stone, that
be stood with the lamp in his hand, as if be woe a statue made to hold
it, moved after these words were spoken, put the lamp down, and confronting the speaker, and taking him, not ungently, by the loose front of
his red woollen shirt, said:
“You know him, you have said. Do you know me?”
“Yes, I know you, Citizen Doctor.”
“We all know you, Citizen Doctor,” said the other three.
He looked abstractedly from one to another, and said, in a lower
voice, after a pause:
“Will you answer his question to me then? How does this happen?”
“Citizen Doctor,” said the first, reluctantly, “he has been denounced
to the Section of Saint Antoine. This citizen,” pointing out the second
who had entered, “is from Saint Antoine.”
The citizen here indicated nodded his head, and added:
“He is accused by Saint Antoine.”
“Of what?” asked the Doctor.
“Citizen Doctor,” said the first, with his former reluctance, “ask no
more. If the Republic demands sacrifices from you, without doubt you
as a good patriot will be happy to make them. The Republic goes before
all. The People is supreme. Evremonde, we are pressed.”
“One word,” the Doctor entreated. “Will you tell me who denounced him?”
“It is against rule,” answered the first; “but you can ask Him of
Saint Antoine here.”
The Doctor turned his eyes upon that man. Who moved uneasily on
his feet, rubbed his beard a little, and at length said:
“Well! Truly it is against rule. But he is denounced—and gravely—
by the Citizen and Citizeness Defarge. And by one other.”
“What other?”
“Do you ask, Citizen Doctor?”
256
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
“Yes.”
“Then,” said he of Saint Antoine, with a strange look, “you will be
answered to-morrow. Now, I am dumb!”
Chapter 8
A Hand at Cards
Happily unconscious of the new calamity at home, Miss Pross threaded
her way along the narrow streets and crossed the river by the bridge
of the Pont-Neuf, reckoning in her mind the number of indispensable
purchases she had to make. Mr. Cruncher, with the basket, walked at
her side. They both looked to the right and to the left into most of
the shops they passed, had a wary eye for all gregarious assemblages of
people, and turned out of their road to avoid any very excited group
of talkers. It was a raw evening, and the misty river, blurred to the eye
with blazing lights and to the ear with harsh noises, showed where the
barges were stationed in which the smiths worked, making guns for the
Army of the Republic. Woe to the man who played tricks with that
Army, or got undeserved promotion in it! Better for him that his beard
had never grown, for the National Razor shaved him close.
Having purchased a few small articles of grocery, and a measure of
oil for the lamp, Miss Pross bethought herself of the wine they wanted.
After peeping into several wine-shops, she stopped at the sign of the
Good Republican Brutus of Antiquity, not far from the National Palace,
once (and twice) the Tuileries, where the aspect of things rather took her
fancy. It had a quieter look than any other place of the same description
they had passed, and, though red with patriotic caps, was not so red as
the rest. Sounding Mr. Cruncher, and finding him of her opinion, Miss
Pross resorted to the Good Republican Brutus of Antiquity, attended by
her cavalier.
Slightly observant of the smoky lights; of the people, pipe in mouth,
playing with limp cards and yellow dominoes; of the one bare-breasted,
bare-armed, soot-begrimed workman reading a journal aloud, and of
the others listening to him; of the weapons worn, or laid aside to be
resumed; of the two or three customers fallen forward asleep, who in
the popular high-shouldered shaggy black spencer looked, in that atti257
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
tude, like slumbering bears or dogs; the two outlandish customers approached the counter, and showed what they wanted.
As their wine was measuring out, a man parted from another man
in a corner, and rose to depart. In going, he had to face Miss Pross. No
sooner did he face her, than Miss Pross uttered a scream, and clapped
her hands.
In a moment, the whole company were on their feet. That somebody
was assassinated by somebody vindicating a difference of opinion was
the likeliest occurrence. Everybody looked to see somebody fall, but
only saw a man and a woman standing staring at each other; the man
with all the outward aspect of a Frenchman and a thorough Republican;
the woman, evidently English.
What was said in this disappointing anti-climax, by the disciples
of the Good Republican Brutus of Antiquity, except that it was something very voluble and loud, would have been as so much Hebrew or
Chaldean to Miss Pross and her protector, though they had been all
ears. But, they had no ears for anything in their surprise. For, it must
be recorded, that not only was Miss Pross lost in amazement and agitation, but, Mr. Cruncher—though it seemed on his own separate and
individual account—was in a state of the greatest wonder.
“What is the matter?” said the man who had caused Miss Pross to
scream; speaking in a vexed, abrupt voice (though in a low tone), and
in English.
“Oh, Solomon, dear Solomon!” cried Miss Pross, clapping her
hands again. “After not setting eyes upon you or hearing of you for
so long a time, do I find you here!”
“Don’t call me Solomon. Do you want to be the death of me?”
asked the man, in a furtive, frightened way.
“Brother, brother!” cried Miss Pross, bursting into tears. “Have I
ever been so hard with you that you ask me such a cruel question?”
“Then hold your meddlesome tongue,” said Solomon, “and come
out, if you want to speak to me. Pay for your wine, and come out.
Who’s this man?”
Miss Pross, shaking her loving and dejected head at her by no means
affectionate brother, said through her tears, “Mr. Cruncher.”
“Let him come out too,” said Solomon. “Does he think me a
ghost?”
Apparently, Mr. Cruncher did, to judge from his looks. He said not
a word, however, and Miss Pross, exploring the depths of her reticule
258
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
through her tears with great difficulty paid for her wine. As she did so,
Solomon turned to the followers of the Good Republican Brutus of Antiquity, and offered a few words of explanation in the French language,
which caused them all to relapse into their former places and pursuits.
“Now,” said Solomon, stopping at the dark street corner, “what do
you want?”
“How dreadfully unkind in a brother nothing has ever turned my
love away from!” cried Miss Pross, “to give me such a greeting, and
show me no affection.”
“There. Confound it! There,” said Solomon, making a dab at Miss
Pross’s lips with his own. “Now are you content?”
Miss Pross only shook her head and wept in silence.
“If you expect me to be surprised,” said her brother Solomon, “I am
not surprised; I knew you were here; I know of most people who are
here. If you really don’t want to endanger my existence—which I half
believe you do—go your ways as soon as possible, and let me go mine.
I am busy. I am an official.”
“My English brother Solomon,” mourned Miss Pross, casting up her
tear-fraught eyes, “that had the makings in him of one of the best and
greatest of men in his native country, an official among foreigners, and
such foreigners! I would almost sooner have seen the dear boy lying in
his—”
“I said so!” cried her brother, interrupting. “I knew it. You want
to be the death of me. I shall be rendered Suspected, by my own sister.
Just as I am getting on!”
“The gracious and merciful Heavens forbid!” cried Miss Pross. “Far
rather would I never see you again, dear Solomon, though I have ever
loved you truly, and ever shall. Say but one affectionate word to me,
and tell me there is nothing angry or estranged between us, and I will
detain you no longer.”
Good Miss Pross! As if the estrangement between them had come
of any culpability of hers. As if Mr. Lorry had not known it for a fact,
years ago, in the quiet corner in Soho, that this precious brother had
spent her money and left her!
He was saying the affectionate word, however, with a far more
grudging condescension and patronage than he could have shown if
their relative merits and positions had been reversed (which is invariably the case, all the world over), when Mr. Cruncher, touching him on
the shoulder, hoarsely and unexpectedly interposed with the following
259
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
singular question:
“I say! Might I ask the favour? As to whether your name is John
Solomon, or Solomon John?”
The official turned towards him with sudden distrust. He had not
previously uttered a word.
“Come!” said Mr. Cruncher. “Speak out, you know.” (Which,
by the way, was more than he could do himself.) “John Solomon, or
Solomon John? She calls you Solomon, and she must know, being your
sister. And I know you’re John, you know. Which of the two goes first?
And regarding that name of Pross, likewise. That warn’t your name
over the water.”
“What do you mean?”
“Well, I don’t know all I mean, for I can’t call to mind what your
name was, over the water.”
“No?”
“No. But I’ll swear it was a name of two syllables.”
“Indeed?”
“Yes. T’other one’s was one syllable. I know you. You was a spy—
witness at the Bailey. What, in the name of the Father of Lies, own
father to yourself, was you called at that time?”
“Barsad,” said another voice, striking in.
“That’s the name for a thousand pound!” cried Jerry.
The speaker who struck in, was Sydney Carton. He had his hands
behind him under the skirts of his riding-coat, and he stood at Mr.
Cruncher’s elbow as negligently as he might have stood at the Old Bailey
itself.
“Don’t be alarmed, my dear Miss Pross. I arrived at Mr. Lorry’s,
to his surprise, yesterday evening; we agreed that I would not present
myself elsewhere until all was well, or unless I could be useful; I present
myself here, to beg a little talk with your brother. I wish you had a better
employed brother than Mr. Barsad. I wish for your sake Mr. Barsad was
not a Sheep of the Prisons.”
Sheep was a cant word of the time for a spy, under the gaolers. The
spy, who was pale, turned paler, and asked him how he dared—
“I’ll tell you,” said Sydney. “I lighted on you, Mr. Barsad, coming
out of the prison of the Conciergerie while I was contemplating the
walls, an hour or more ago. You have a face to be remembered, and I
remember faces well. Made curious by seeing you in that connection,
and having a reason, to which you are no stranger, for associating you
260
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
with the misfortunes of a friend now very unfortunate, I walked in your
direction. I walked into the wine-shop here, close after you, and sat near
you. I had no difficulty in deducing from your unreserved conversation,
and the rumour openly going about among your admirers, the nature
of your calling. And gradually, what I had done at random, seemed to
shape itself into a purpose, Mr. Barsad.”
“What purpose?” the spy asked.
“It would be troublesome, and might be dangerous, to explain in
the street. Could you favour me, in confidence, with some minutes of
your company—at the office of Tellson’s Bank, for instance?”
“Under a threat?”
“Oh! Did I say that?”
“Then, why should I go there?”
“Really, Mr. Barsad, I can’t say, if you can’t.”
“Do you mean that you won’t say, sir?” the spy irresolutely asked.
“You apprehend me very clearly, Mr. Barsad. I won’t.”
Carton’s negligent recklessness of manner came powerfully in aid of
his quickness and skill, in such a business as he had in his secret mind,
and with such a man as he had to do with. His practised eye saw it, and
made the most of it.
“Now, I told you so,” said the spy, casting a reproachful look at his
sister; “if any trouble comes of this, it’s your doing.”
“Come, come, Mr. Barsad!” exclaimed Sydney. “Don’t be ungrateful. But for my great respect for your sister, I might not have led up
so pleasantly to a little proposal that I wish to make for our mutual
satisfaction. Do you go with me to the Bank?”
“I’ll hear what you have got to say. Yes, I’ll go with you.”
“I propose that we first conduct your sister safely to the corner of
her own street. Let me take your arm, Miss Pross. This is not a good
city, at this time, for you to be out in, unprotected; and as your escort
knows Mr. Barsad, I will invite him to Mr. Lorry’s with us. Are we
ready? Come then!”
Miss Pross recalled soon afterwards, and to the end of her life remembered, that as she pressed her hands on Sydney’s arm and looked
up in his face, imploring him to do no hurt to Solomon, there was a
braced purpose in the arm and a kind of inspiration in the eyes, which
not only contradicted his light manner, but changed and raised the man.
She was too much occupied then with fears for the brother who so
little deserved her affection, and with Sydney’s friendly reassurances, ad261
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
equately to heed what she observed.
They left her at the corner of the street, and Carton led the way to
Mr. Lorry’s, which was within a few minutes’ walk. John Barsad, or
Solomon Pross, walked at his side.
Mr. Lorry had just finished his dinner, and was sitting before a cheery
little log or two of fire—perhaps looking into their blaze for the picture
of that younger elderly gentleman from Tellson’s, who had looked into
the red coals at the Royal George at Dover, now a good many years ago.
He turned his head as they entered, and showed the surprise with which
he saw a stranger.
“Miss Pross’s brother, sir,” said Sydney. “Mr. Barsad.”
“Barsad?” repeated the old gentleman, “Barsad? I have an association with the name—and with the face.”
“I told you you had a remarkable face, Mr. Barsad,” observed Carton, coolly. “Pray sit down.”
As he took a chair himself, he supplied the link that Mr. Lorry
wanted, by saying to him with a frown, “Witness at that trial.” Mr.
Lorry immediately remembered, and regarded his new visitor with an
undisguised look of abhorrence.
“Mr. Barsad has been recognised by Miss Pross as the affectionate
brother you have heard of,” said Sydney, “and has acknowledged the
relationship. I pass to worse news. Darnay has been arrested again.”
Struck with consternation, the old gentleman exclaimed, “What do
you tell me! I left him safe and free within these two hours, and am
about to return to him!”
“Arrested for all that. When was it done, Mr. Barsad?”
“Just now, if at all.”
“Mr. Barsad is the best authority possible, sir,” said Sydney, “and I
have it from Mr. Barsad’s communication to a friend and brother Sheep
over a bottle of wine, that the arrest has taken place. He left the messengers at the gate, and saw them admitted by the porter. There is no
earthly doubt that he is retaken.”
Mr. Lorry’s business eye read in the speaker’s face that it was loss
of time to dwell upon the point. Confused, but sensible that something
might depend on his presence of mind, he commanded himself, and was
silently attentive.
“Now, I trust,” said Sydney to him, “that the name and influence of
Doctor Manette may stand him in as good stead to-morrow—you said
he would be before the Tribunal again to-morrow, Mr. Barsad?—”
262
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
“Yes; I believe so.”
“—In as good stead to-morrow as to-day. But it may not be so. I
own to you, I am shaken, Mr. Lorry, by Doctor Manette’s not having
had the power to prevent this arrest.”
“He may not have known of it beforehand,” said Mr. Lorry.
“But that very circumstance would be alarming, when we remember
how identified he is with his son-in-law.”
“That’s true,” Mr. Lorry acknowledged, with his troubled hand at
his chin, and his troubled eyes on Carton.
“In short,” said Sydney, “this is a desperate time, when desperate
games are played for desperate stakes. Let the Doctor play the winning
game; I will play the losing one. No man’s life here is worth purchase.
Any one carried home by the people to-day, may be condemned tomorrow. Now, the stake I have resolved to play for, in case of the worst, is
a friend in the Conciergerie. And the friend I purpose to myself to win,
is Mr. Barsad.”
“You need have good cards, sir,” said the spy.
“I’ll run them over. I’ll see what I hold,—Mr. Lorry, you know what
a brute I am; I wish you’d give me a little brandy.”
It was put before him, and he drank off a glassful—drank off another glassful—pushed the bottle thoughtfully away.
“Mr. Barsad,” he went on, in the tone of one who really was looking over a hand at cards: “Sheep of the prisons, emissary of Republican
committees, now turnkey, now prisoner, always spy and secret informer,
so much the more valuable here for being English that an Englishman is
less open to suspicion of subornation in those characters than a Frenchman, represents himself to his employers under a false name. That’s
a very good card. Mr. Barsad, now in the employ of the republican
French government, was formerly in the employ of the aristocratic English government, the enemy of France and freedom. That’s an excellent
card. Inference clear as day in this region of suspicion, that Mr. Barsad,
still in the pay of the aristocratic English government, is the spy of Pitt,
the treacherous foe of the Republic crouching in its bosom, the English
traitor and agent of all mischief so much spoken of and so difficult to
find. That’s a card not to be beaten. Have you followed my hand, Mr.
Barsad?”
“Not to understand your play,” returned the spy, somewhat uneasily.
“I play my Ace, Denunciation of Mr. Barsad to the nearest Section
263
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
Committee. Look over your hand, Mr. Barsad, and see what you have.
Don’t hurry.”
He drew the bottle near, poured out another glassful of brandy, and
drank it off. He saw that the spy was fearful of his drinking himself into
a fit state for the immediate denunciation of him. Seeing it, he poured
out and drank another glassful.
“Look over your hand carefully, Mr. Barsad. Take time.”
It was a poorer hand than he suspected. Mr. Barsad saw losing
cards in it that Sydney Carton knew nothing of. Thrown out of his honourable employment in England, through too much unsuccessful hard
swearing there—not because he was not wanted there; our English reasons for vaunting our superiority to secrecy and spies are of very modern
date—he knew that he had crossed the Channel, and accepted service
in France: first, as a tempter and an eavesdropper among his own countrymen there: gradually, as a tempter and an eavesdropper among the
natives. He knew that under the overthrown government he had been a
spy upon Saint Antoine and Defarge’s wine-shop; had received from the
watchful police such heads of information concerning Doctor Manette’s
imprisonment, release, and history, as should serve him for an introduction to familiar conversation with the Defarges; and tried them on
Madame Defarge, and had broken down with them signally. He always
remembered with fear and trembling, that that terrible woman had knitted when he talked with her, and had looked ominously at him as her
fingers moved. He had since seen her, in the Section of Saint Antoine,
over and over again produce her knitted registers, and denounce people
whose lives the guillotine then surely swallowed up. He knew, as every
one employed as he was did, that he was never safe; that flight was impossible; that he was tied fast under the shadow of the axe; and that
in spite of his utmost tergiversation and treachery in furtherance of the
reigning terror, a word might bring it down upon him. Once denounced,
and on such grave grounds as had just now been suggested to his mind,
he foresaw that the dreadful woman of whose unrelenting character he
had seen many proofs, would produce against him that fatal register,
and would quash his last chance of life. Besides that all secret men are
men soon terrified, here were surely cards enough of one black suit, to
justify the holder in growing rather livid as he turned them over.
“You scarcely seem to like your hand,” said Sydney, with the greatest
composure. “Do you play?”
“I think, sir,” said the spy, in the meanest manner, as he turned to
264
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
Mr. Lorry, “I may appeal to a gentleman of your years and benevolence,
to put it to this other gentleman, so much your junior, whether he can
under any circumstances reconcile it to his station to play that Ace of
which he has spoken. I admit that I am a spy, and that it is considered
a discreditable station—though it must be filled by somebody; but this
gentleman is no spy, and why should he so demean himself as to make
himself one?”
“I play my Ace, Mr. Barsad,” said Carton, taking the answer on
himself, and looking at his watch, “without any scruple, in a very few
minutes.”
“I should have hoped, gentlemen both,” said the spy, always striving
to hook Mr. Lorry into the discussion, “that your respect for my sister—
”
“I could not better testify my respect for your sister than by finally
relieving her of her brother,” said Sydney Carton.
“You think not, sir?”
“I have thoroughly made up my mind about it.”
The smooth manner of the spy, curiously in dissonance with his ostentatiously rough dress, and probably with his usual demeanour, received such a check from the inscrutability of Carton,—who was a mystery to wiser and honester men than he,—that it faltered here and failed
him. While he was at a loss, Carton said, resuming his former air of
contemplating cards:
“And indeed, now I think again, I have a strong impression that
I have another good card here, not yet enumerated. That friend and
fellow-Sheep, who spoke of himself as pasturing in the country prisons;
who was he?”
“French. You don’t know him,” said the spy, quickly.
“French, eh?” repeated Carton, musing, and not appearing to notice
him at all, though he echoed his word. “Well; he may be.”
“Is, I assure you,” said the spy; “though it’s not important.”
“Though it’s not important,” repeated Carton, in the same mechanical way—“though it’s not important—No, it’s not important. No. Yet
I know the face.”
“I think not. I am sure not. It can’t be,” said the spy.
“It-can’t-be,” muttered Sydney Carton, retrospectively, and idling
his glass (which fortunately was a small one) again. “Can’t-be. Spoke
good French. Yet like a foreigner, I thought?”
“Provincial,” said the spy.
265
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
“No. Foreign!” cried Carton, striking his open hand on the table,
as a light broke clearly on his mind. “Cly! Disguised, but the same man.
We had that man before us at the Old Bailey.”
“Now, there you are hasty, sir,” said Barsad, with a smile that gave
his aquiline nose an extra inclination to one side; “there you really give
me an advantage over you. Cly (who I will unreservedly admit, at this
distance of time, was a partner of mine) has been dead several years. I
attended him in his last illness. He was buried in London, at the church
of Saint Pancras-in-the-Fields. His unpopularity with the blackguard
multitude at the moment prevented my following his remains, but I
helped to lay him in his coffin.”
Here, Mr. Lorry became aware, from where he sat, of a most remarkable goblin shadow on the wall. Tracing it to its source, he discovered
it to be caused by a sudden extraordinary rising and stiffening of all the
risen and stiff hair on Mr. Cruncher’s head.
“Let us be reasonable,” said the spy, “and let us be fair. To show
you how mistaken you are, and what an unfounded assumption yours
is, I will lay before you a certificate of Cly’s burial, which I happened to
have carried in my pocket-book,” with a hurried hand he produced and
opened it, “ever since. There it is. Oh, look at it, look at it! You may
take it in your hand; it’s no forgery.”
Here, Mr. Lorry perceived the reflection on the wall to elongate, and
Mr. Cruncher rose and stepped forward. His hair could not have been
more violently on end, if it had been that moment dressed by the Cow
with the crumpled horn in the house that Jack built.
Unseen by the spy, Mr. Cruncher stood at his side, and touched him
on the shoulder like a ghostly bailiff.
“That there Roger Cly, master,” said Mr. Cruncher, with a taciturn
and iron-bound visage. “So you put him in his coffin?”
“I did.”
“Who took him out of it?”
Barsad leaned back in his chair, and stammered, “What do you
mean?”
“I mean,” said Mr. Cruncher, “that he warn’t never in it. No! Not
he! I’ll have my head took off, if he was ever in it.”
The spy looked round at the two gentlemen; they both looked in
unspeakable astonishment at Jerry.
“I tell you,” said Jerry, “that you buried paving-stones and earth in
that there coffin. Don’t go and tell me that you buried Cly. It was a take
266
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
in. Me and two more knows it.”
“How do you know it?”
“What’s that to you? Ecod!” growled Mr. Cruncher, “it’s you I
have got a old grudge again, is it, with your shameful impositions upon
tradesmen! I’d catch hold of your throat and choke you for half a
guinea.”
Sydney Carton, who, with Mr. Lorry, had been lost in amazement at
this turn of the business, here requested Mr. Cruncher to moderate and
explain himself.
“At another time, sir,” he returned, evasively, “the present time is
ill-conwenient for explainin’. What I stand to, is, that he knows well
wot that there Cly was never in that there coffin. Let him say he was,
in so much as a word of one syllable, and I’ll either catch hold of his
throat and choke him for half a guinea;” Mr. Cruncher dwelt upon this
as quite a liberal offer; “or I’ll out and announce him.”
“Humph! I see one thing,” said Carton. “I hold another card, Mr.
Barsad. Impossible, here in raging Paris, with Suspicion filling the air,
for you to outlive denunciation, when you are in communication with
another aristocratic spy of the same antecedents as yourself, who, moreover, has the mystery about him of having feigned death and come to
life again! A plot in the prisons, of the foreigner against the Republic.
A strong card—a certain Guillotine card! Do you play?”
“No!” returned the spy. “I throw up. I confess that we were so
unpopular with the outrageous mob, that I only got away from England
at the risk of being ducked to death, and that Cly was so ferreted up
and down, that he never would have got away at all but for that sham.
Though how this man knows it was a sham, is a wonder of wonders to
me.”
“Never you trouble your head about this man,” retorted the contentious Mr. Cruncher; “you’ll have trouble enough with giving your attention to that gentleman. And look here! Once more!”—Mr. Cruncher
could not be restrained from making rather an ostentatious parade of
his liberality—“I’d catch hold of your throat and choke you for half a
guinea.”
The Sheep of the prisons turned from him to Sydney Carton, and
said, with more decision, “It has come to a point. I go on duty soon,
and can’t overstay my time. You told me you had a proposal; what is
it? Now, it is of no use asking too much of me. Ask me to do anything
in my office, putting my head in great extra danger, and I had better
267
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
trust my life to the chances of a refusal than the chances of consent. In
short, I should make that choice. You talk of desperation. We are all
desperate here. Remember! I may denounce you if I think proper, and I
can swear my way through stone walls, and so can others. Now, what
do you want with me?”
“Not very much. You are a turnkey at the Conciergerie?”
“I tell you once for all, there is no such thing as an escape possible,”
said the spy, firmly.
“Why need you tell me what I have not asked? You are a turnkey at
the Conciergerie?”
“I am sometimes.”
“You can be when you choose?”
“I can pass in and out when I choose.”
Sydney Carton filled another glass with brandy, poured it slowly out
upon the hearth, and watched it as it dropped. It being all spent, he said,
rising:
“So far, we have spoken before these two, because it was as well
that the merits of the cards should not rest solely between you and me.
Come into the dark room here, and let us have one final word alone.”
Chapter 9
The Game Made
While Sydney Carton and the Sheep of the prisons were in the adjoining dark room, speaking so low that not a sound was heard, Mr.
Lorry looked at Jerry in considerable doubt and mistrust. That honest
tradesman’s manner of receiving the look, did not inspire confidence; he
changed the leg on which he rested, as often as if he had fifty of those
limbs, and were trying them all; he examined his finger-nails with a
very questionable closeness of attention; and whenever Mr. Lorry’s eye
caught his, he was taken with that peculiar kind of short cough requiring the hollow of a hand before it, which is seldom, if ever, known to
be an infirmity attendant on perfect openness of character.
“Jerry,” said Mr. Lorry. “Come here.”
Mr. Cruncher came forward sideways, with one of his shoulders in
advance of him.
“What have you been, besides a messenger?”
268
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
After some cogitation, accompanied with an intent look at his patron, Mr. Cruncher conceived the luminous idea of replying, “Agicultooral character.”
“My mind misgives me much,” said Mr. Lorry, angrily shaking a
forefinger at him, “that you have used the respectable and great house
of Tellson’s as a blind, and that you have had an unlawful occupation of
an infamous description. If you have, don’t expect me to befriend you
when you get back to England. If you have, don’t expect me to keep
your secret. Tellson’s shall not be imposed upon.”
“I hope, sir,” pleaded the abashed Mr. Cruncher, “that a gentleman
like yourself wot I’ve had the honour of odd jobbing till I’m grey at it,
would think twice about harming of me, even if it wos so—I don’t say
it is, but even if it wos. And which it is to be took into account that if
it wos, it wouldn’t, even then, be all o’ one side. There’d be two sides
to it. There might be medical doctors at the present hour, a picking
up their guineas where a honest tradesman don’t pick up his fardens—
fardens! no, nor yet his half fardens—half fardens! no, nor yet his
quarter—a banking away like smoke at Tellson’s, and a cocking their
medical eyes at that tradesman on the sly, a going in and going out to
their own carriages—ah! equally like smoke, if not more so. Well, that
’ud be imposing, too, on Tellson’s. For you cannot sarse the goose and
not the gander. And here’s Mrs. Cruncher, or leastways wos in the Old
England times, and would be to-morrow, if cause given, a floppin’ again
the business to that degree as is ruinating—stark ruinating! Whereas
them medical doctors’ wives don’t flop—catch ’em at it! Or, if they flop,
their toppings goes in favour of more patients, and how can you rightly
have one without t’other? Then, wot with undertakers, and wot with
parish clerks, and wot with sextons, and wot with private watchmen
(all awaricious and all in it), a man wouldn’t get much by it, even if it
wos so. And wot little a man did get, would never prosper with him,
Mr. Lorry. He’d never have no good of it; he’d want all along to be out
of the line, if he, could see his way out, being once in—even if it wos
so.”
“Ugh!” cried Mr. Lorry, rather relenting, nevertheless, “I am
shocked at the sight of you.”
“Now, what I would humbly offer to you, sir,” pursued Mr.
Cruncher, “even if it wos so, which I don’t say it is—”
“Don’t prevaricate,” said Mr. Lorry.
“No, I will not, sir,” returned Mr. Crunches as if nothing were fur269
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
ther from his thoughts or practice—“which I don’t say it is—wot I
would humbly offer to you, sir, would be this. Upon that there stool,
at that there Bar, sets that there boy of mine, brought up and growed
up to be a man, wot will errand you, message you, general-light-job
you, till your heels is where your head is, if such should be your wishes.
If it wos so, which I still don’t say it is (for I will not prewaricate to
you, sir), let that there boy keep his father’s place, and take care of his
mother; don’t blow upon that boy’s father—do not do it, sir—and let
that father go into the line of the reg’lar diggin’, and make amends for
what he would have undug—if it wos so-by diggin’ of ’em in with a will,
and with conwictions respectin’ the futur’ keepin’ of ’em safe. That, Mr.
Lorry,” said Mr. Cruncher, wiping his forehead with his arm, as an announcement that he had arrived at the peroration of his discourse, “is
wot I would respectfully offer to you, sir. A man don’t see all this here
a goin’ on dreadful round him, in the way of Subjects without heads,
dear me, plentiful enough fur to bring the price down to porterage and
hardly that, without havin’ his serious thoughts of things. And these
here would be mine, if it wos so, entreatin’ of you fur to bear in mind
that wot I said just now, I up and said in the good cause when I might
have kep’ it back.”
“That at least is true,” said Mr. Lorry. “Say no more now. It may
be that I shall yet stand your friend, if you deserve it, and repent in
action—not in words. I want no more words.”
Mr. Cruncher knuckled his forehead, as Sydney Carton and the spy
returned from the dark room. “Adieu, Mr. Barsad,” said the former;
“our arrangement thus made, you have nothing to fear from me.”
He sat down in a chair on the hearth, over against Mr. Lorry. When
they were alone, Mr. Lorry asked him what he had done?
“Not much. If it should go ill with the prisoner, I have ensured
access to him, once.”
Mr. Lorry’s countenance fell.
“It is all I could do,” said Carton. “To propose too much, would be
to put this man’s head under the axe, and, as he himself said, nothing
worse could happen to him if he were denounced. It was obviously the
weakness of the position. There is no help for it.”
“But access to him,” said Mr. Lorry, “if it should go ill before the
Tribunal, will not save him.”
“I never said it would.”
Mr. Lorry’s eyes gradually sought the fire; his sympathy with his
270
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
darling, and the heavy disappointment of his second arrest, gradually
weakened them; he was an old man now, overborne with anxiety of
late, and his tears fell.
“You are a good man and a true friend,” said Carton, in an altered
voice. “Forgive me if I notice that you are affected. I could not see
my father weep, and sit by, careless. And I could not respect your sorrow more, if you were my father. You are free from that misfortune,
however.”
Though he said the last words, with a slip into his usual manner,
there was a true feeling and respect both in his tone and in his touch,
that Mr. Lorry, who had never seen the better side of him, was wholly
unprepared for. He gave him his hand, and Carton gently pressed it.
“To return to poor Darnay,” said Carton. “Don’t tell Her of this
interview, or this arrangement. It would not enable Her to go to see
him. She might think it was contrived, in case of the worse, to convey
to him the means of anticipating the sentence.”
Mr. Lorry had not thought of that, and he looked quickly at Carton
to see if it were in his mind. It seemed to be; he returned the look, and
evidently understood it.
“She might think a thousand things,” Carton said, “and any of them
would only add to her trouble. Don’t speak of me to her. As I said to
you when I first came, I had better not see her. I can put my hand out, to
do any little helpful work for her that my hand can find to do, without
that. You are going to her, I hope? She must be very desolate to-night.”
“I am going now, directly.”
“I am glad of that. She has such a strong attachment to you and
reliance on you. How does she look?”
“Anxious and unhappy, but very beautiful.”
“Ah!”
It was a long, grieving sound, like a sigh—almost like a sob. It
attracted Mr. Lorry’s eyes to Carton’s face, which was turned to the
fire. A light, or a shade (the old gentleman could not have said which),
passed from it as swiftly as a change will sweep over a hill-side on a
wild bright day, and he lifted his foot to put back one of the little flaming logs, which was tumbling forward. He wore the white riding-coat
and top-boots, then in vogue, and the light of the fire touching their
light surfaces made him look very pale, with his long brown hair, all
untrimmed, hanging loose about him. His indifference to fire was sufficiently remarkable to elicit a word of remonstrance from Mr. Lorry;
271
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
his boot was still upon the hot embers of the flaming log, when it had
broken under the weight of his foot.
“I forgot it,” he said.
Mr. Lorry’s eyes were again attracted to his face. Taking note of the
wasted air which clouded the naturally handsome features, and having
the expression of prisoners’ faces fresh in his mind, he was strongly
reminded of that expression.
“And your duties here have drawn to an end, sir?” said Carton,
turning to him.
“Yes. As I was telling you last night when Lucie came in so unexpectedly, I have at length done all that I can do here. I hoped to have left
them in perfect safety, and then to have quitted Paris. I have my Leave
to Pass. I was ready to go.”
They were both silent.
“Yours is a long life to look back upon, sir?” said Carton, wistfully.
“I am in my seventy-eighth year.”
“You have been useful all your life; steadily and constantly occupied;
trusted, respected, and looked up to?”
“I have been a man of business, ever since I have been a man. indeed,
I may say that I was a man of business when a boy.”
“See what a place you fill at seventy-eight. How many people will
miss you when you leave it empty!”
“A solitary old bachelor,” answered Mr. Lorry, shaking his head.
“There is nobody to weep for me.”
“How can you say that? Wouldn’t She weep for you? Wouldn’t her
child?”
“Yes, yes, thank God. I didn’t quite mean what I said.”
“It is a thing to thank God for; is it not?”
“Surely, surely.”
“If you could say, with truth, to your own solitary heart, to-night, ’I
have secured to myself the love and attachment, the gratitude or respect,
of no human creature; I have won myself a tender place in no regard;
I have done nothing good or serviceable to be remembered by!’ your
seventy-eight years would be seventy-eight heavy curses; would they
not?”
“You say truly, Mr. Carton; I think they would be.”
Sydney turned his eyes again upon the fire, and, after a silence of a
few moments, said:
“I should like to ask you:—Does your childhood seem far off? Do
272
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
the days when you sat at your mother’s knee, seem days of very long
ago?”
Responding to his softened manner, Mr. Lorry answered:
“Twenty years back, yes; at this time of my life, no. For, as I draw
closer and closer to the end, I travel in the circle, nearer and nearer to
the beginning. It seems to be one of the kind smoothings and preparings
of the way. My heart is touched now, by many remembrances that had
long fallen asleep, of my pretty young mother (and I so old!), and by
many associations of the days when what we call the World was not so
real with me, and my faults were not confirmed in me.”
“I understand the feeling!” exclaimed Carton, with a bright flush.
“And you are the better for it?”
“I hope so.”
Carton terminated the conversation here, by rising to help him on
with his outer coat; “But you,” said Mr. Lorry, reverting to the theme,
“you are young.”
“Yes,” said Carton. “I am not old, but my young way was never the
way to age. Enough of me.”
“And of me, I am sure,” said Mr. Lorry. “Are you going out?”
“I’ll walk with you to her gate. You know my vagabond and restless
habits. If I should prowl about the streets a long time, don’t be uneasy;
I shall reappear in the morning. You go to the Court to-morrow?”
“Yes, unhappily.”
“I shall be there, but only as one of the crowd. My Spy will find a
place for me. Take my arm, sir.”
Mr. Lorry did so, and they went down-stairs and out in the streets.
A few minutes brought them to Mr. Lorry’s destination. Carton left
him there; but lingered at a little distance, and turned back to the gate
again when it was shut, and touched it. He had heard of her going to
the prison every day. “She came out here,” he said, looking about him,
“turned this way, must have trod on these stones often. Let me follow in
her steps.”
It was ten o’clock at night when he stood before the prison of La
Force, where she had stood hundreds of times. A little wood-sawyer,
having closed his shop, was smoking his pipe at his shop-door.
“Good night, citizen,” said Sydney Carton, pausing in going by; for,
the man eyed him inquisitively.
“Good night, citizen.”
“How goes the Republic?”
273
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
“You mean the Guillotine. Not ill. Sixty-three to-day. We shall
mount to a hundred soon. Samson and his men complain sometimes,
of being exhausted. Ha, ha, ha! He is so droll, that Samson. Such a
Barber!”
“Do you often go to see him—”
“Shave? Always. Every day. What a barber! You have seen him at
work?”
“Never.”
“Go and see him when he has a good batch. Figure this to yourself,
citizen; he shaved the sixty-three to-day, in less than two pipes! Less
than two pipes. Word of honour!”
As the grinning little man held out the pipe he was smoking, to
explain how he timed the executioner, Carton was so sensible of a rising
desire to strike the life out of him, that he turned away.
“But you are not English,” said the wood-sawyer, “though you wear
English dress?”
“Yes,” said Carton, pausing again, and answering over his shoulder.
“You speak like a Frenchman.”
“I am an old student here.”
“Aha, a perfect Frenchman! Good night, Englishman.”
“Good night, citizen.”
“But go and see that droll dog,” the little man persisted, calling after
him. “And take a pipe with you!”
Sydney had not gone far out of sight, when he stopped in the middle
of the street under a glimmering lamp, and wrote with his pencil on
a scrap of paper. Then, traversing with the decided step of one who
remembered the way well, several dark and dirty streets—much dirtier
than usual, for the best public thoroughfares remained uncleansed in
those times of terror—he stopped at a chemist’s shop, which the owner
was closing with his own hands. A small, dim, crooked shop, kept in a
tortuous, up-hill thoroughfare, by a small, dim, crooked man.
Giving this citizen, too, good night, as he confronted him at his
counter, he laid the scrap of paper before him. “Whew!” the chemist
whistled softly, as he read it. “Hi! hi! hi!”
Sydney Carton took no heed, and the chemist said:
“For you, citizen?”
“For me.”
“You will be careful to keep them separate, citizen? You know the
consequences of mixing them?”
274
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
“Perfectly.”
Certain small packets were made and given to him. He put them,
one by one, in the breast of his inner coat, counted out the money for
them, and deliberately left the shop. “There is nothing more to do,”
said he, glancing upward at the moon, “until to-morrow. I can’t sleep.”
It was not a reckless manner, the manner in which he said these
words aloud under the fast-sailing clouds, nor was it more expressive of
negligence than defiance. It was the settled manner of a tired man, who
had wandered and struggled and got lost, but who at length struck into
his road and saw its end.
Long ago, when he had been famous among his earliest competitors
as a youth of great promise, he had followed his father to the grave.
His mother had died, years before. These solemn words, which had
been read at his father’s grave, arose in his mind as he went down the
dark streets, among the heavy shadows, with the moon and the clouds
sailing on high above him. “I am the resurrection and the life, saith the
Lord: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live:
and whosoever liveth and believeth in me, shall never die.”
In a city dominated by the axe, alone at night, with natural sorrow
rising in him for the sixty-three who had been that day put to death,
and for to-morrow’s victims then awaiting their doom in the prisons,
and still of to-morrow’s and to-morrow’s, the chain of association that
brought the words home, like a rusty old ship’s anchor from the deep,
might have been easily found. He did not seek it, but repeated them and
went on.
With a solemn interest in the lighted windows where the people were
going to rest, forgetful through a few calm hours of the horrors surrounding them; in the towers of the churches, where no prayers were
said, for the popular revulsion had even travelled that length of selfdestruction from years of priestly impostors, plunderers, and profligates;
in the distant burial-places, reserved, as they wrote upon the gates, for
Eternal Sleep; in the abounding gaols; and in the streets along which
the sixties rolled to a death which had become so common and material,
that no sorrowful story of a haunting Spirit ever arose among the people
out of all the working of the Guillotine; with a solemn interest in the
whole life and death of the city settling down to its short nightly pause
in fury; Sydney Carton crossed the Seine again for the lighter streets.
Few coaches were abroad, for riders in coaches were liable to be
suspected, and gentility hid its head in red nightcaps, and put on heavy
275
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
shoes, and trudged. But, the theatres were all well filled, and the people
poured cheerfully out as he passed, and went chatting home. At one of
the theatre doors, there was a little girl with a mother, looking for a way
across the street through the mud. He carried the child over, and before,
the timid arm was loosed from his neck asked her for a kiss.
“I am the resurrection and the life, saith the Lord: he that believeth
in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: and whosoever liveth and
believeth in me, shall never die.”
Now, that the streets were quiet, and the night wore on, the words
were in the echoes of his feet, and were in the air. Perfectly calm and
steady, he sometimes repeated them to himself as he walked; but, he
heard them always.
The night wore out, and, as he stood upon the bridge listening to
the water as it splashed the river-walls of the Island of Paris, where the
picturesque confusion of houses and cathedral shone bright in the light
of the moon, the day came coldly, looking like a dead face out of the sky.
Then, the night, with the moon and the stars, turned pale and died, and
for a little while it seemed as if Creation were delivered over to Death’s
dominion.
But, the glorious sun, rising, seemed to strike those words, that
burden of the night, straight and warm to his heart in its long bright
rays. And looking along them, with reverently shaded eyes, a bridge of
light appeared to span the air between him and the sun, while the river
sparkled under it.
The strong tide, so swift, so deep, and certain, was like a congenial
friend, in the morning stillness. He walked by the stream, far from the
houses, and in the light and warmth of the sun fell asleep on the bank.
When he awoke and was afoot again, he lingered there yet a little longer,
watching an eddy that turned and turned purposeless, until the stream
absorbed it, and carried it on to the sea.—“Like me.”
A trading-boat, with a sail of the softened colour of a dead leaf, then
glided into his view, floated by him, and died away. As its silent track in
the water disappeared, the prayer that had broken up out of his heart
for a merciful consideration of all his poor blindnesses and errors, ended
in the words, “I am the resurrection and the life.”
Mr. Lorry was already out when he got back, and it was easy to surmise where the good old man was gone. Sydney Carton drank nothing
but a little coffee, ate some bread, and, having washed and changed to
refresh himself, went out to the place of trial.
276
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
The court was all astir and a-buzz, when the black sheep—whom
many fell away from in dread—pressed him into an obscure corner
among the crowd. Mr. Lorry was there, and Doctor Manette was there.
She was there, sitting beside her father.
When her husband was brought in, she turned a look upon him, so
sustaining, so encouraging, so full of admiring love and pitying tenderness, yet so courageous for his sake, that it called the healthy blood into
his face, brightened his glance, and animated his heart. If there had been
any eyes to notice the influence of her look, on Sydney Carton, it would
have been seen to be the same influence exactly.
Before that unjust Tribunal, there was little or no order of procedure,
ensuring to any accused person any reasonable hearing. There could
have been no such Revolution, if all laws, forms, and ceremonies, had
not first been so monstrously abused, that the suicidal vengeance of the
Revolution was to scatter them all to the winds.
Every eye was turned to the jury. The same determined patriots
and good republicans as yesterday and the day before, and to-morrow
and the day after. Eager and prominent among them, one man with a
craving face, and his fingers perpetually hovering about his lips, whose
appearance gave great satisfaction to the spectators. A life-thirsting,
cannibal-looking, bloody-minded juryman, the Jacques Three of St. Antoine. The whole jury, as a jury of dogs empannelled to try the deer.
Every eye then turned to the five judges and the public prosecutor.
No favourable leaning in that quarter to-day. A fell, uncompromising,
murderous business-meaning there. Every eye then sought some other
eye in the crowd, and gleamed at it approvingly; and heads nodded at
one another, before bending forward with a strained attention.
Charles Evremonde, called Darnay. Released yesterday. Reaccused
and retaken yesterday. Indictment delivered to him last night. Suspected
and Denounced enemy of the Republic, Aristocrat, one of a family of
tyrants, one of a race proscribed, for that they had used their abolished
privileges to the infamous oppression of the people. Charles Evremonde,
called Darnay, in right of such proscription, absolutely Dead in Law.
To this effect, in as few or fewer words, the Public Prosecutor.
The President asked, was the Accused openly denounced or secretly?
“Openly, President.”
“By whom?”
“Three voices. Ernest Defarge, wine-vendor of St. Antoine.”
“Good.”
277
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
“Therese Defarge, his wife.”
“Good.”
“Alexandre Manette, physician.”
A great uproar took place in the court, and in the midst of it, Doctor Manette was seen, pale and trembling, standing where he had been
seated.
“President, I indignantly protest to you that this is a forgery and a
fraud. You know the accused to be the husband of my daughter. My
daughter, and those dear to her, are far dearer to me than my life. Who
and where is the false conspirator who says that I denounce the husband
of my child!”
“Citizen Manette, be tranquil. To fail in submission to the authority
of the Tribunal would be to put yourself out of Law. As to what is
dearer to you than life, nothing can be so dear to a good citizen as the
Republic.”
Loud acclamations hailed this rebuke. The President rang his bell,
and with warmth resumed.
“If the Republic should demand of you the sacrifice of your child
herself, you would have no duty but to sacrifice her. Listen to what is
to follow. In the meanwhile, be silent!”
Frantic acclamations were again raised. Doctor Manette sat down,
with his eyes looking around, and his lips trembling; his daughter drew
closer to him. The craving man on the jury rubbed his hands together,
and restored the usual hand to his mouth.
Defarge was produced, when the court was quiet enough to admit of
his being heard, and rapidly expounded the story of the imprisonment,
and of his having been a mere boy in the Doctor’s service, and of the
release, and of the state of the prisoner when released and delivered to
him. This short examination followed, for the court was quick with its
work.
“You did good service at the taking of the Bastille, citizen?”
“I believe so.”
Here, an excited woman screeched from the crowd: “You were one
of the best patriots there. Why not say so? You were a cannoneer that
day there, and you were among the first to enter the accursed fortress
when it fell. Patriots, I speak the truth!”
It was The Vengeance who, amidst the warm commendations of the
audience, thus assisted the proceedings. The President rang his bell; but,
The Vengeance, warming with encouragement, shrieked, “I defy that
278
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
bell!” wherein she was likewise much commended.
“Inform the Tribunal of what you did that day within the Bastille,
citizen.”
“I knew,” said Defarge, looking down at his wife, who stood at the
bottom of the steps on which he was raised, looking steadily up at him;
“I knew that this prisoner, of whom I speak, had been confined in a cell
known as One Hundred and Five, North Tower. I knew it from himself.
He knew himself by no other name than One Hundred and Five, North
Tower, when he made shoes under my care. As I serve my gun that day,
I resolve, when the place shall fall, to examine that cell. It falls. I mount
to the cell, with a fellow-citizen who is one of the Jury, directed by a
gaoler. I examine it, very closely. In a hole in the chimney, where a stone
has been worked out and replaced, I find a written paper. This is that
written paper. I have made it my business to examine some specimens of
the writing of Doctor Manette. This is the writing of Doctor Manette.
I confide this paper, in the writing of Doctor Manette, to the hands of
the President.”
“Let it be read.”
In a dead silence and stillness—the prisoner under trial looking lovingly at his wife, his wife only looking from him to look with solicitude at her father, Doctor Manette keeping his eyes fixed on the reader,
Madame Defarge never taking hers from the prisoner, Defarge never taking his from his feasting wife, and all the other eyes there intent upon
the Doctor, who saw none of them—the paper was read, as follows.
Chapter 10
The Substance of the Shadow
“I, Alexandre Manette, unfortunate physician, native of Beauvais, and
afterwards resident in Paris, write this melancholy paper in my doleful
cell in the Bastille, during the last month of the year, 1767. I write it at
stolen intervals, under every difficulty. I design to secrete it in the wall
of the chimney, where I have slowly and laboriously made a place of
concealment for it. Some pitying hand may find it there, when I and my
sorrows are dust.
“These words are formed by the rusty iron point with which I
write with difficulty in scrapings of soot and charcoal from the chimney,
279
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
mixed with blood, in the last month of the tenth year of my captivity.
Hope has quite departed from my breast. I know from terrible warnings
I have noted in myself that my reason will not long remain unimpaired,
but I solemnly declare that I am at this time in the possession of my right
mind—that my memory is exact and circumstantial—and that I write
the truth as I shall answer for these my last recorded words, whether
they be ever read by men or not, at the Eternal Judgment-seat.
“One cloudy moonlight night, in the third week of December (I
think the twenty-second of the month) in the year 1757, I was walking on a retired part of the quay by the Seine for the refreshment of
the frosty air, at an hour’s distance from my place of residence in the
Street of the School of Medicine, when a carriage came along behind
me, driven very fast. As I stood aside to let that carriage pass, apprehensive that it might otherwise run me down, a head was put out at the
window, and a voice called to the driver to stop.
“The carriage stopped as soon as the driver could rein in his horses,
and the same voice called to me by my name. I answered. The carriage
was then so far in advance of me that two gentlemen had time to open
the door and alight before I came up with it.
I observed that they were both wrapped in cloaks, and appeared to
conceal themselves. As they stood side by side near the carriage door,
I also observed that they both looked of about my own age, or rather
younger, and that they were greatly alike, in stature, manner, voice, and
(as far as I could see) face too.
“ ‘You are Doctor Manette?’ said one.
“I am.”
“ ‘Doctor Manette, formerly of Beauvais,’ said the other; ‘the young
physician, originally an expert surgeon, who within the last year or two
has made a rising reputation in Paris?’
“ ‘Gentlemen,’ I returned, ‘I am that Doctor Manette of whom you
speak so graciously.’
“ ‘We have been to your residence,’ said the first, ‘and not being so
fortunate as to find you there, and being informed that you were probably walking in this direction, we followed, in the hope of overtaking
you. Will you please to enter the carriage?’
“The manner of both was imperious, and they both moved, as these
words were spoken, so as to place me between themselves and the carriage door. They were armed. I was not.
“ ‘Gentlemen,’ said I, ‘pardon me; but I usually inquire who does me
280
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
the honour to seek my assistance, and what is the nature of the case to
which I am summoned.’
“The reply to this was made by him who had spoken second. ’Doctor, your clients are people of condition. As to the nature of the case,
our confidence in your skill assures us that you will ascertain it for yourself better than we can describe it. Enough. Will you please to enter the
carriage?’
“I could do nothing but comply, and I entered it in silence. They
both entered after me—the last springing in, after putting up the steps.
The carriage turned about, and drove on at its former speed.
“I repeat this conversation exactly as it occurred. I have no doubt
that it is, word for word, the same. I describe everything exactly as it
took place, constraining my mind not to wander from the task. Where
I make the broken marks that follow here, I leave off for the time, and
put my paper in its hiding-place.
* * * *
“The carriage left the streets behind, passed the North Barrier, and
emerged upon the country road. At two-thirds of a league from the
Barrier—I did not estimate the distance at that time, but afterwards
when I traversed it—it struck out of the main avenue, and presently
stopped at a solitary house, We all three alighted, and walked, by a
damp soft footpath in a garden where a neglected fountain had overflowed, to the door of the house. It was not opened immediately, in
answer to the ringing of the bell, and one of my two conductors struck
the man who opened it, with his heavy riding glove, across the face.
“There was nothing in this action to attract my particular attention,
for I had seen common people struck more commonly than dogs. But,
the other of the two, being angry likewise, struck the man in like manner
with his arm; the look and bearing of the brothers were then so exactly
alike, that I then first perceived them to be twin brothers.
“From the time of our alighting at the outer gate (which we found
locked, and which one of the brothers had opened to admit us, and
had relocked), I had heard cries proceeding from an upper chamber. I
was conducted to this chamber straight, the cries growing louder as we
ascended the stairs, and I found a patient in a high fever of the brain,
lying on a bed.
“The patient was a woman of great beauty, and young; assuredly
not much past twenty. Her hair was torn and ragged, and her arms
were bound to her sides with sashes and handkerchiefs. I noticed that
281
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
these bonds were all portions of a gentleman’s dress. On one of them,
which was a fringed scarf for a dress of ceremony, I saw the armorial
bearings of a Noble, and the letter E.
“I saw this, within the first minute of my contemplation of the patient; for, in her restless strivings she had turned over on her face on the
edge of the bed, had drawn the end of the scarf into her mouth, and
was in danger of suffocation. My first act was to put out my hand to
relieve her breathing; and in moving the scarf aside, the embroidery in
the corner caught my sight.
“I turned her gently over, placed my hands upon her breast to calm
her and keep her down, and looked into her face. Her eyes were dilated
and wild, and she constantly uttered piercing shrieks, and repeated the
words, ‘My husband, my father, and my brother!’ and then counted up
to twelve, and said, ‘Hush!’ For an instant, and no more, she would
pause to listen, and then the piercing shrieks would begin again, and
she would repeat the cry, ‘My husband, my father, and my brother!’
and would count up to twelve, and say, ‘Hush!’ There was no variation
in the order, or the manner. There was no cessation, but the regular
moment’s pause, in the utterance of these sounds.
“ ‘How long,’ I asked, ‘has this lasted?’
“To distinguish the brothers, I will call them the elder and the
younger; by the elder, I mean him who exercised the most authority.
It was the elder who replied, ‘Since about this hour last night.’
“ ‘She has a husband, a father, and a brother?’
“ ‘A brother.’
“ ‘I do not address her brother?’
“He answered with great contempt, ‘No.’
“ ‘She has some recent association with the number twelve?’
“The younger brother impatiently rejoined, ‘With twelve o’clock?’
“ ‘See, gentlemen,’ said I, still keeping my hands upon her breast,
’how useless I am, as you have brought me! If I had known what I was
coming to see, I could have come provided. As it is, time must be lost.
There are no medicines to be obtained in this lonely place.’
“The elder brother looked to the younger, who said haughtily, ‘There
is a case of medicines here;’ and brought it from a closet, and put it on
the table.
* * * *
“I opened some of the bottles, smelt them, and put the stoppers to
my lips. If I had wanted to use anything save narcotic medicines that
282
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
were poisons in themselves, I would not have administered any of those.
“ ‘Do you doubt them?’ asked the younger brother.
“ ‘You see, monsieur, I am going to use them,’ I replied, and said no
more.
“I made the patient swallow, with great difficulty, and after many
efforts, the dose that I desired to give. As I intended to repeat it after a
while, and as it was necessary to watch its influence, I then sat down by
the side of the bed. There was a timid and suppressed woman in attendance (wife of the man down-stairs), who had retreated into a corner.
The house was damp and decayed, indifferently furnished—evidently,
recently occupied and temporarily used. Some thick old hangings had
been nailed up before the windows, to deaden the sound of the shrieks.
They continued to be uttered in their regular succession, with the cry,
‘My husband, my father, and my brother!’ the counting up to twelve,
and ‘Hush!’ The frenzy was so violent, that I had not unfastened the
bandages restraining the arms; but, I had looked to them, to see that
they were not painful. The only spark of encouragement in the case,
was, that my hand upon the sufferer’s breast had this much soothing
influence, that for minutes at a time it tranquillised the figure. It had no
effect upon the cries; no pendulum could be more regular.
“For the reason that my hand had this effect (I assume), I had sat by
the side of the bed for half an hour, with the two brothers looking on,
before the elder said:
“ ‘There is another patient.’
“I was startled, and asked, ‘Is it a pressing case?’
“ ‘You had better see,’ he carelessly answered; and took up a light.
* * * *
“The other patient lay in a back room across a second staircase,
which was a species of loft over a stable. There was a low plastered
ceiling to a part of it; the rest was open, to the ridge of the tiled roof,
and there were beams across. Hay and straw were stored in that portion
of the place, fagots for firing, and a heap of apples in sand. I had to pass
through that part, to get at the other. My memory is circumstantial and
unshaken. I try it with these details, and I see them all, in this my cell
in the Bastille, near the close of the tenth year of my captivity, as I saw
them all that night.
“On some hay on the ground, with a cushion thrown under his head,
lay a handsome peasant boy—a boy of not more than seventeen at the
most. He lay on his back, with his teeth set, his right hand clenched on
283
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
his breast, and his glaring eyes looking straight upward. I could not see
where his wound was, as I kneeled on one knee over him; but, I could
see that he was dying of a wound from a sharp point.
“ ‘I am a doctor, my poor fellow,’ said I. ‘Let me examine it.’
“ ‘I do not want it examined,’ he answered; ‘let it be.’
“It was under his hand, and I soothed him to let me move his hand
away. The wound was a sword-thrust, received from twenty to twentyfour hours before, but no skill could have saved him if it had been
looked to without delay. He was then dying fast. As I turned my eyes to
the elder brother, I saw him looking down at this handsome boy whose
life was ebbing out, as if he were a wounded bird, or hare, or rabbit;
not at all as if he were a fellow-creature.
“ ‘How has this been done, monsieur?’ said I.
“ ‘A crazed young common dog! A serf! Forced my brother to draw
upon him, and has fallen by my brother’s sword—like a gentleman.’
“There was no touch of pity, sorrow, or kindred humanity, in this
answer. The speaker seemed to acknowledge that it was inconvenient to
have that different order of creature dying there, and that it would have
been better if he had died in the usual obscure routine of his vermin
kind. He was quite incapable of any compassionate feeling about the
boy, or about his fate.
“The boy’s eyes had slowly moved to him as he had spoken, and
they now slowly moved to me.
“ ‘Doctor, they are very proud, these Nobles; but we common dogs
are proud too, sometimes. They plunder us, outrage us, beat us, kill
us; but we have a little pride left, sometimes. She—have you seen her,
Doctor?’
“The shrieks and the cries were audible there, though subdued by
the distance. He referred to them, as if she were lying in our presence.
“I said, ‘I have seen her.’
“ ‘She is my sister, Doctor. They have had their shameful rights, these
Nobles, in the modesty and virtue of our sisters, many years, but we
have had good girls among us. I know it, and have heard my father say
so. She was a good girl. She was betrothed to a good young man, too:
a tenant of his. We were all tenants of his—that man’s who stands there.
The other is his brother, the worst of a bad race.’
“It was with the greatest difficulty that the boy gathered bodily force
to speak; but, his spirit spoke with a dreadful emphasis.
“ ‘We were so robbed by that man who stands there, as all we com284
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
mon dogs are by those superior Beings—taxed by him without mercy,
obliged to work for him without pay, obliged to grind our corn at his
mill, obliged to feed scores of his tame birds on our wretched crops, and
forbidden for our lives to keep a single tame bird of our own, pillaged
and plundered to that degree that when we chanced to have a bit of
meat, we ate it in fear, with the door barred and the shutters closed,
that his people should not see it and take it from us—I say, we were so
robbed, and hunted, and were made so poor, that our father told us it
was a dreadful thing to bring a child into the world, and that what we
should most pray for, was, that our women might be barren and our
miserable race die out!’
“I had never before seen the sense of being oppressed, bursting forth
like a fire. I had supposed that it must be latent in the people somewhere;
but, I had never seen it break out, until I saw it in the dying boy.
“ ‘Nevertheless, Doctor, my sister married. He was ailing at that
time, poor fellow, and she married her lover, that she might tend and
comfort him in our cottage—our dog-hut, as that man would call it.
She had not been married many weeks, when that man’s brother saw
her and admired her, and asked that man to lend her to him—for what
are husbands among us! He was willing enough, but my sister was good
and virtuous, and hated his brother with a hatred as strong as mine.
What did the two then, to persuade her husband to use his influence
with her, to make her willing?’
“The boy’s eyes, which had been fixed on mine, slowly turned to
the looker-on, and I saw in the two faces that all he said was true. The
two opposing kinds of pride confronting one another, I can see, even in
this Bastille; the gentleman’s, all negligent indifference; the peasants, all
trodden-down sentiment, and passionate revenge.
“ ‘You know, Doctor, that it is among the Rights of these Nobles to
harness us common dogs to carts, and drive us. They so harnessed him
and drove him. You know that it is among their Rights to keep us in
their grounds all night, quieting the frogs, in order that their noble sleep
may not be disturbed. They kept him out in the unwholesome mists at
night, and ordered him back into his harness in the day. But he was not
persuaded. No! Taken out of harness one day at noon, to feed—if he
could find food—he sobbed twelve times, once for every stroke of the
bell, and died on her bosom.’
“Nothing human could have held life in the boy but his determination to tell all his wrong. He forced back the gathering shadows of
285
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
death, as he forced his clenched right hand to remain clenched, and to
cover his wound.
“ ‘Then, with that man’s permission and even with his aid, his
brother took her away; in spite of what I know she must have told
his brother—and what that is, will not be long unknown to you, Doctor,
if it is now—his brother took her away—for his pleasure and diversion,
for a little while. I saw her pass me on the road. When I took the tidings home, our father’s heart burst; he never spoke one of the words that
filled it. I took my young sister (for I have another) to a place beyond
the reach of this man, and where, at least, she will never be his vassal.
Then, I tracked the brother here, and last night climbed in—a common
dog, but sword in hand.—Where is the loft window? It was somewhere
here?’
“The room was darkening to his sight; the world was narrowing
around him. I glanced about me, and saw that the hay and straw were
trampled over the floor, as if there had been a struggle.
“ ‘She heard me, and ran in. I told her not to come near us till he
was dead. He came in and first tossed me some pieces of money; then
struck at me with a whip. But I, though a common dog, so struck at
him as to make him draw. Let him break into as many pieces as he will,
the sword that he stained with my common blood; he drew to defend
himself—thrust at me with all his skill for his life.’
“My glance had fallen, but a few moments before, on the fragments
of a broken sword, lying among the hay. That weapon was a gentleman’s. In another place, lay an old sword that seemed to have been a
soldier’s.
“ ‘Now, lift me up, Doctor; lift me up. Where is he?’
“ ‘He is not here,’ I said, supporting the boy, and thinking that he
referred to the brother.
“ ‘He! Proud as these nobles are, he is afraid to see me. Where is the
man who was here? turn my face to him.’
“I did so, raising the boy’s head against my knee. But, invested
for the moment with extraordinary power, he raised himself completely:
obliging me to rise too, or I could not have still supported him.
“ ‘Marquis,’ said the boy, turned to him with his eyes opened wide,
and his right hand raised, ‘in the days when all these things are to be
answered for, I summon you and yours, to the last of your bad race, to
answer for them. I mark this cross of blood upon you, as a sign that I
do it. In the days when all these things are to be answered for, I summon
286
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
your brother, the worst of the bad race, to answer for them separately. I
mark this cross of blood upon him, as a sign that I do it.’
“Twice, he put his hand to the wound in his breast, and with his
forefinger drew a cross in the air. He stood for an instant with the finger
yet raised, and as it dropped, he dropped with it, and I laid him down
dead.
* * * *
“When I returned to the bedside of the young woman, I found her
raving in precisely the same order of continuity. I knew that this might
last for many hours, and that it would probably end in the silence of the
grave.
“I repeated the medicines I had given her, and I sat at the side of
the bed until the night was far advanced. She never abated the piercing
quality of her shrieks, never stumbled in the distinctness or the order of
her words. They were always ‘My husband, my father, and my brother!
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve.
Hush!’
“This lasted twenty-six hours from the time when I first saw her. I
had come and gone twice, and was again sitting by her, when she began
to falter. I did what little could be done to assist that opportunity, and
by-and-bye she sank into a lethargy, and lay like the dead.
“It was as if the wind and rain had lulled at last, after a long and
fearful storm. I released her arms, and called the woman to assist me
to compose her figure and the dress she had to. It was then that I knew
her condition to be that of one in whom the first expectations of being a
mother have arisen; and it was then that I lost the little hope I had had
of her.
“ ‘Is she dead?’ asked the Marquis, whom I will still describe as the
elder brother, coming booted into the room from his horse.
“ ‘Not dead,’ said I; ‘but like to die.’
“ ‘What strength there is in these common bodies!’ he said, looking
down at her with some curiosity.
“ ‘There is prodigious strength,’ I answered him, ‘in sorrow and despair.’
“He first laughed at my words, and then frowned at them. He
moved a chair with his foot near to mine, ordered the woman away,
and said in a subdued voice,
“ ‘Doctor, finding my brother in this difficulty with these hinds, I recommended that your aid should be invited. Your reputation is high, and,
287
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
as a young man with your fortune to make, you are probably mindful
of your interest. The things that you see here, are things to be seen, and
not spoken of.’
“I listened to the patient’s breathing, and avoided answering.
“ ‘Do you honour me with your attention, Doctor?’
“ ‘Monsieur,’ said I, ‘in my profession, the communications of patients are always received in confidence.’ I was guarded in my answer,
for I was troubled in my mind with what I had heard and seen.
“Her breathing was so difficult to trace, that I carefully tried the
pulse and the heart. There was life, and no more. Looking round as I
resumed my seat, I found both the brothers intent upon me.
* * * *
“I write with so much difficulty, the cold is so severe, I am so fearful
of being detected and consigned to an underground cell and total darkness, that I must abridge this narrative. There is no confusion or failure
in my memory; it can recall, and could detail, every word that was ever
spoken between me and those brothers.
“She lingered for a week. Towards the last, I could understand some
few syllables that she said to me, by placing my ear close to her lips. She
asked me where she was, and I told her; who I was, and I told her. It
was in vain that I asked her for her family name. She faintly shook her
head upon the pillow, and kept her secret, as the boy had done.
“I had no opportunity of asking her any question, until I had told the
brothers she was sinking fast, and could not live another day. Until then,
though no one was ever presented to her consciousness save the woman
and myself, one or other of them had always jealously sat behind the
curtain at the head of the bed when I was there. But when it came to
that, they seemed careless what communication I might hold with her;
as if—the thought passed through my mind—I were dying too.
“I always observed that their pride bitterly resented the younger
brother’s (as I call him) having crossed swords with a peasant, and that
peasant a boy. The only consideration that appeared to affect the mind
of either of them was the consideration that this was highly degrading
to the family, and was ridiculous. As often as I caught the younger
brother’s eyes, their expression reminded me that he disliked me deeply,
for knowing what I knew from the boy. He was smoother and more
polite to me than the elder; but I saw this. I also saw that I was an
incumbrance in the mind of the elder, too.
“My patient died, two hours before midnight—at a time, by my
288
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
watch, answering almost to the minute when I had first seen her. I was
alone with her, when her forlorn young head drooped gently on one
side, and all her earthly wrongs and sorrows ended.
“The brothers were waiting in a room down-stairs, impatient to ride
away. I had heard them, alone at the bedside, striking their boots with
their riding-whips, and loitering up and down.
“ ‘At last she is dead?’ said the elder, when I went in.
“ ‘She is dead,’ said I.
“ ‘I congratulate you, my brother,’ were his words as he turned
round.
“He had before offered me money, which I had postponed taking.
He now gave me a rouleau of gold. I took it from his hand, but laid it
on the table. I had considered the question, and had resolved to accept
nothing.
“ ‘Pray excuse me,’ said I. ‘Under the circumstances, no.’
“They exchanged looks, but bent their heads to me as I bent mine
to them, and we parted without another word on either side.
* * * *
“I am weary, weary, weary-worn down by misery. I cannot read
what I have written with this gaunt hand.
“Early in the morning, the rouleau of gold was left at my door in a
little box, with my name on the outside. From the first, I had anxiously
considered what I ought to do. I decided, that day, to write privately
to the Minister, stating the nature of the two cases to which I had been
summoned, and the place to which I had gone: in effect, stating all
the circumstances. I knew what Court influence was, and what the
immunities of the Nobles were, and I expected that the matter would
never be heard of; but, I wished to relieve my own mind. I had kept the
matter a profound secret, even from my wife; and this, too, I resolved
to state in my letter. I had no apprehension whatever of my real danger;
but I was conscious that there might be danger for others, if others were
compromised by possessing the knowledge that I possessed.
“I was much engaged that day, and could not complete my letter that
night. I rose long before my usual time next morning to finish it. It was
the last day of the year. The letter was lying before me just completed,
when I was told that a lady waited, who wished to see me.
* * * *
“I am growing more and more unequal to the task I have set myself.
It is so cold, so dark, my senses are so benumbed, and the gloom upon
289
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
me is so dreadful.
“The lady was young, engaging, and handsome, but not marked for
long life. She was in great agitation. She presented herself to me as the
wife of the Marquis St. Evremonde. I connected the title by which the
boy had addressed the elder brother, with the initial letter embroidered
on the scarf, and had no difficulty in arriving at the conclusion that I
had seen that nobleman very lately.
“My memory is still accurate, but I cannot write the words of our
conversation. I suspect that I am watched more closely than I was, and
I know not at what times I may be watched. She had in part suspected,
and in part discovered, the main facts of the cruel story, of her husband’s
share in it, and my being resorted to. She did not know that the girl was
dead. Her hope had been, she said in great distress, to show her, in
secret, a woman’s sympathy. Her hope had been to avert the wrath of
Heaven from a House that had long been hateful to the suffering many.
“She had reasons for believing that there was a young sister living,
and her greatest desire was, to help that sister. I could tell her nothing
but that there was such a sister; beyond that, I knew nothing. Her
inducement to come to me, relying on my confidence, had been the
hope that I could tell her the name and place of abode. Whereas, to this
wretched hour I am ignorant of both.
* * * *
“These scraps of paper fail me. One was taken from me, with a
warning, yesterday. I must finish my record to-day.
“She was a good, compassionate lady, and not happy in her marriage. How could she be! The brother distrusted and disliked her, and
his influence was all opposed to her; she stood in dread of him, and in
dread of her husband too. When I handed her down to the door, there
was a child, a pretty boy from two to three years old, in her carriage.
“ ‘For his sake, Doctor,’ she said, pointing to him in tears, ‘I would
do all I can to make what poor amends I can. He will never prosper
in his inheritance otherwise. I have a presentiment that if no other innocent atonement is made for this, it will one day be required of him.
What I have left to call my own—it is little beyond the worth of a few
jewels—I will make it the first charge of his life to bestow, with the compassion and lamenting of his dead mother, on this injured family, if the
sister can be discovered.’
“She kissed the boy, and said, caressing him, ‘It is for thine own
dear sake. Thou wilt be faithful, little Charles?’ The child answered her
290
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
bravely, ‘Yes!’ I kissed her hand, and she took him in her arms, and
went away caressing him. I never saw her more.
“As she had mentioned her husband’s name in the faith that I knew
it, I added no mention of it to my letter. I sealed my letter, and, not
trusting it out of my own hands, delivered it myself that day.
“That night, the last night of the year, towards nine o’clock, a man
in a black dress rang at my gate, demanded to see me, and softly followed my servant, Ernest Defarge, a youth, up-stairs. When my servant
came into the room where I sat with my wife—O my wife, beloved of
my heart! My fair young English wife!—we saw the man, who was
supposed to be at the gate, standing silent behind him.
“An urgent case in the Rue St. Honore, he said. It would not detain
me, he had a coach in waiting.
“It brought me here, it brought me to my grave. When I was clear
of the house, a black muffler was drawn tightly over my mouth from
behind, and my arms were pinioned. The two brothers crossed the road
from a dark corner, and identified me with a single gesture. The Marquis
took from his pocket the letter I had written, showed it me, burnt it in
the light of a lantern that was held, and extinguished the ashes with his
foot. Not a word was spoken. I was brought here, I was brought to my
living grave.
“If it had pleased God to put it in the hard heart of either of the
brothers, in all these frightful years, to grant me any tidings of my dearest wife—so much as to let me know by a word whether alive or dead—I
might have thought that He had not quite abandoned them. But, now
I believe that the mark of the red cross is fatal to them, and that they
have no part in His mercies. And them and their descendants, to the
last of their race, I, Alexandre Manette, unhappy prisoner, do this last
night of the year 1767, in my unbearable agony, denounce to the times
when all these things shall be answered for. I denounce them to Heaven
and to earth.”
A terrible sound arose when the reading of this document was done.
A sound of craving and eagerness that had nothing articulate in it but
blood. The narrative called up the most revengeful passions of the time,
and there was not a head in the nation but must have dropped before it.
Little need, in presence of that tribunal and that auditory, to show
how the Defarges had not made the paper public, with the other captured Bastille memorials borne in procession, and had kept it, biding
their time. Little need to show that this detested family name had long
291
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
been anathematised by Saint Antoine, and was wrought into the fatal
register. The man never trod ground whose virtues and services would
have sustained him in that place that day, against such denunciation.
And all the worse for the doomed man, that the denouncer was
a well-known citizen, his own attached friend, the father of his wife.
One of the frenzied aspirations of the populace was, for imitations of
the questionable public virtues of antiquity, and for sacrifices and selfimmolations on the people’s altar. Therefore when the President said
(else had his own head quivered on his shoulders), that the good physician of the Republic would deserve better still of the Republic by rooting out an obnoxious family of Aristocrats, and would doubtless feel
a sacred glow and joy in making his daughter a widow and her child
an orphan, there was wild excitement, patriotic fervour, not a touch of
human sympathy.
“Much influence around him, has that Doctor?” murmured
Madame Defarge, smiling to The Vengeance. “Save him now, my Doctor, save him!”
At every juryman’s vote, there was a roar. Another and another.
Roar and roar.
Unanimously voted. At heart and by descent an Aristocrat, an enemy of the Republic, a notorious oppressor of the People. Back to the
Conciergerie, and Death within four-and-twenty hours!
Chapter 11
Dusk
The wretched wife of the innocent man thus doomed to die, fell under
the sentence, as if she had been mortally stricken. But, she uttered no
sound; and so strong was the voice within her, representing that it was
she of all the world who must uphold him in his misery and not augment
it, that it quickly raised her, even from that shock.
The Judges having to take part in a public demonstration out of
doors, the Tribunal adjourned. The quick noise and movement of the
court’s emptying itself by many passages had not ceased, when Lucie
stood stretching out her arms towards her husband, with nothing in her
face but love and consolation.
292
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
“If I might touch him! If I might embrace him once! O, good citizens,
if you would have so much compassion for us!”
There was but a gaoler left, along with two of the four men who had
taken him last night, and Barsad. The people had all poured out to the
show in the streets. Barsad proposed to the rest, “Let her embrace him
then; it is but a moment.” It was silently acquiesced in, and they passed
her over the seats in the hall to a raised place, where he, by leaning over
the dock, could fold her in his arms.
“Farewell, dear darling of my soul. My parting blessing on my love.
We shall meet again, where the weary are at rest!”
They were her husband’s words, as he held her to his bosom.
“I can bear it, dear Charles. I am supported from above: don’t suffer
for me. A parting blessing for our child.”
“I send it to her by you. I kiss her by you. I say farewell to her by
you.”
“My husband. No! A moment!” He was tearing himself apart from
her. “We shall not be separated long. I feel that this will break my heart
by-and-bye; but I will do my duty while I can, and when I leave her,
God will raise up friends for her, as He did for me.”
Her father had followed her, and would have fallen on his knees to
both of them, but that Darnay put out a hand and seized him, crying:
“No, no! What have you done, what have you done, that you should
kneel to us! We know now, what a struggle you made of old. We know,
now what you underwent when you suspected my descent, and when
you knew it. We know now, the natural antipathy you strove against,
and conquered, for her dear sake. We thank you with all our hearts,
and all our love and duty. Heaven be with you!”
Her father’s only answer was to draw his hands through his white
hair, and wring them with a shriek of anguish.
“It could not be otherwise,” said the prisoner. “All things have
worked together as they have fallen out. it was the always-vain endeavour to discharge my poor mother’s trust that first brought my fatal
presence near you. Good could never come of such evil, a happier end
was not in nature to so unhappy a beginning. Be comforted, and forgive
me. Heaven bless you!”
As he was drawn away, his wife released him, and stood looking
after him with her hands touching one another in the attitude of prayer,
and with a radiant look upon her face, in which there was even a comforting smile. As he went out at the prisoners’ door, she turned, laid her
293
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
head lovingly on her father’s breast, tried to speak to him, and fell at his
feet.
Then, issuing from the obscure corner from which he had never
moved, Sydney Carton came and took her up. Only her father and Mr.
Lorry were with her. His arm trembled as it raised her, and supported
her head. Yet, there was an air about him that was not all of pity—that
had a flush of pride in it.
“Shall I take her to a coach? I shall never feel her weight.”
He carried her lightly to the door, and laid her tenderly down in a
coach. Her father and their old friend got into it, and he took his seat
beside the driver.
When they arrived at the gateway where he had paused in the dark
not many hours before, to picture to himself on which of the rough
stones of the street her feet had trodden, he lifted her again, and carried
her up the staircase to their rooms. There, he laid her down on a couch,
where her child and Miss Pross wept over her.
“Don’t recall her to herself,” he said, softly, to the latter, “she is
better so. Don’t revive her to consciousness, while she only faints.”
“Oh, Carton, Carton, dear Carton!” cried little Lucie, springing
up and throwing her arms passionately round him, in a burst of grief.
“Now that you have come, I think you will do something to help
mamma, something to save papa! O, look at her, dear Carton! Can
you, of all the people who love her, bear to see her so?”
He bent over the child, and laid her blooming cheek against his face.
He put her gently from him, and looked at her unconscious mother.
“Before I go,” he said, and paused—“I may kiss her?”
It was remembered afterwards that when he bent down and touched
her face with his lips, he murmured some words. The child, who was
nearest to him, told them afterwards, and told her grandchildren when
she was a handsome old lady, that she heard him say, “A life you love.”
When he had gone out into the next room, he turned suddenly on
Mr. Lorry and her father, who were following, and said to the latter:
“You had great influence but yesterday, Doctor Manette; let it at
least be tried. These judges, and all the men in power, are very friendly
to you, and very recognisant of your services; are they not?”
“Nothing connected with Charles was concealed from me. I had the
strongest assurances that I should save him; and I did.” He returned the
answer in great trouble, and very slowly.
“Try them again. The hours between this and to-morrow afternoon
294
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
are few and short, but try.”
“I intend to try. I will not rest a moment.”
“That’s well. I have known such energy as yours do great things
before now—though never,” he added, with a smile and a sigh together,
“such great things as this. But try! Of little worth as life is when we
misuse it, it is worth that effort. It would cost nothing to lay down if it
were not.”
“I will go,” said Doctor Manette, “to the Prosecutor and the President straight, and I will go to others whom it is better not to name. I
will write too, and—But stay! There is a Celebration in the streets, and
no one will be accessible until dark.”
“That’s true. Well! It is a forlorn hope at the best, and not much
the forlorner for being delayed till dark. I should like to know how you
speed; though, mind! I expect nothing! When are you likely to have
seen these dread powers, Doctor Manette?”
“Immediately after dark, I should hope. Within an hour or two from
this.”
“It will be dark soon after four. Let us stretch the hour or two. If I
go to Mr. Lorry’s at nine, shall I hear what you have done, either from
our friend or from yourself?”
“Yes.”
“May you prosper!”
Mr. Lorry followed Sydney to the outer door, and, touching him on
the shoulder as he was going away, caused him to turn.
“I have no hope,” said Mr. Lorry, in a low and sorrowful whisper.
“Nor have I.”
“If any one of these men, or all of these men, were disposed to spare
him—which is a large supposition; for what is his life, or any man’s to
them!—I doubt if they durst spare him after the demonstration in the
court.”
“And so do I. I heard the fall of the axe in that sound.”
Mr. Lorry leaned his arm upon the door-post, and bowed his face
upon it.
“Don’t despond,” said Carton, very gently; “don’t grieve. I encouraged Doctor Manette in this idea, because I felt that it might one day be
consolatory to her. Otherwise, she might think ‘his life was want only
thrown away or wasted,’ and that might trouble her.”
“Yes, yes, yes,” returned Mr. Lorry, drying his eyes, “you are right.
But he will perish; there is no real hope.”
295
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
“Yes. He will perish: there is no real hope,” echoed Carton.
And walked with a settled step, down-stairs.
Chapter 12
Darkness
Sydney Carton paused in the street, not quite decided where to go. “At
Tellson’s banking-house at nine,” he said, with a musing face. “Shall I
do well, in the mean time, to show myself? I think so. It is best that
these people should know there is such a man as I here; it is a sound
precaution, and may be a necessary preparation. But care, care, care!
Let me think it out!”
Checking his steps which had begun to tend towards an object, he
took a turn or two in the already darkening street, and traced the
thought in his mind to its possible consequences. His first impression
was confirmed. “It is best,” he said, finally resolved, “that these people
should know there is such a man as I here.” And he turned his face
towards Saint Antoine.
Defarge had described himself, that day, as the keeper of a wineshop in the Saint Antoine suburb. It was not difficult for one who knew
the city well, to find his house without asking any question. Having
ascertained its situation, Carton came out of those closer streets again,
and dined at a place of refreshment and fell sound asleep after dinner.
For the first time in many years, he had no strong drink. Since last night
he had taken nothing but a little light thin wine, and last night he had
dropped the brandy slowly down on Mr. Lorry’s hearth like a man who
had done with it.
It was as late as seven o’clock when he awoke refreshed, and went
out into the streets again. As he passed along towards Saint Antoine, he
stopped at a shop-window where there was a mirror, and slightly altered
the disordered arrangement of his loose cravat, and his coat-collar, and
his wild hair. This done, he went on direct to Defarge’s, and went in.
There happened to be no customer in the shop but Jacques Three, of
the restless fingers and the croaking voice. This man, whom he had seen
upon the Jury, stood drinking at the little counter, in conversation with
the Defarges, man and wife. The Vengeance assisted in the conversation,
like a regular member of the establishment.
296
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
As Carton walked in, took his seat and asked (in very indifferent
French) for a small measure of wine, Madame Defarge cast a careless
glance at him, and then a keener, and then a keener, and then advanced
to him herself, and asked him what it was he had ordered.
He repeated what he had already said.
“English?” asked Madame Defarge, inquisitively raising her dark
eyebrows.
After looking at her, as if the sound of even a single French word
were slow to express itself to him, he answered, in his former strong
foreign accent. “Yes, madame, yes. I am English!”
Madame Defarge returned to her counter to get the wine, and, as he
took up a Jacobin journal and feigned to pore over it puzzling out its
meaning, he heard her say, “I swear to you, like Evremonde!”
Defarge brought him the wine, and gave him Good Evening.
“How?”
“Good evening.”
“Oh! Good evening, citizen,” filling his glass. “Ah! and good wine.
I drink to the Republic.”
Defarge went back to the counter, and said, “Certainly, a little like.”
Madame sternly retorted, “I tell you a good deal like.” Jacques Three
pacifically remarked, “He is so much in your mind, see you, madame.”
The amiable Vengeance added, with a laugh, “Yes, my faith! And you
are looking forward with so much pleasure to seeing him once more
to-morrow!”
Carton followed the lines and words of his paper, with a slow forefinger, and with a studious and absorbed face. They were all leaning
their arms on the counter close together, speaking low. After a silence
of a few moments, during which they all looked towards him without
disturbing his outward attention from the Jacobin editor, they resumed
their conversation.
“It is true what madame says,” observed Jacques Three. “Why stop?
There is great force in that. Why stop?”
“Well, well,” reasoned Defarge, “but one must stop somewhere. After all, the question is still where?”
“At extermination,” said madame.
“Magnificent!” croaked Jacques Three. The Vengeance, also, highly
approved.
“Extermination is good doctrine, my wife,” said Defarge, rather
troubled; “in general, I say nothing against it. But this Doctor has suf297
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
fered much; you have seen him to-day; you have observed his face when
the paper was read.”
“I have observed his face!” repeated madame, contemptuously and
angrily. “Yes. I have observed his face. I have observed his face to be
not the face of a true friend of the Republic. Let him take care of his
face!”
“And you have observed, my wife,” said Defarge, in a deprecatory
manner, “the anguish of his daughter, which must be a dreadful anguish
to him!”
“I have observed his daughter,” repeated madame; “yes, I have observed his daughter, more times than one. I have observed her to-day,
and I have observed her other days. I have observed her in the court,
and I have observed her in the street by the prison. Let me but lift my
finger—!” She seemed to raise it (the listener’s eyes were always on his
paper), and to let it fall with a rattle on the ledge before her, as if the
axe had dropped.
“The citizeness is superb!” croaked the Juryman.
“She is an Angel!” said The Vengeance, and embraced her.
“As to thee,” pursued madame, implacably, addressing her husband,
“if it depended on thee—which, happily, it does not—thou wouldst rescue this man even now.”
“No!” protested Defarge. “Not if to lift this glass would do it! But
I would leave the matter there. I say, stop there.”
“See you then, Jacques,” said Madame Defarge, wrathfully; “and
see you, too, my little Vengeance; see you both! Listen! For other
crimes as tyrants and oppressors, I have this race a long time on my
register, doomed to destruction and extermination. Ask my husband, is
that so.”
“It is so,” assented Defarge, without being asked.
“In the beginning of the great days, when the Bastille falls, he finds
this paper of to-day, and he brings it home, and in the middle of the
night when this place is clear and shut, we read it, here on this spot, by
the light of this lamp. Ask him, is that so.”
“It is so,” assented Defarge.
“That night, I tell him, when the paper is read through, and the
lamp is burnt out, and the day is gleaming in above those shutters and
between those iron bars, that I have now a secret to communicate. Ask
him, is that so.”
“It is so,” assented Defarge again.
298
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
“I communicate to him that secret. I smite this bosom with these
two hands as I smite it now, and I tell him, ‘Defarge, I was brought
up among the fishermen of the sea-shore, and that peasant family so
injured by the two Evremonde brothers, as that Bastille paper describes,
is my family. Defarge, that sister of the mortally wounded boy upon
the ground was my sister, that husband was my sister’s husband, that
unborn child was their child, that brother was my brother, that father
was my father, those dead are my dead, and that summons to answer
for those things descends to me!’ Ask him, is that so.”
“It is so,” assented Defarge once more.
“Then tell Wind and Fire where to stop,” returned madame; “but
don’t tell me.”
Both her hearers derived a horrible enjoyment from the deadly nature of her wrath—the listener could feel how white she was, without
seeing her—and both highly commended it. Defarge, a weak minority,
interposed a few words for the memory of the compassionate wife of
the Marquis; but only elicited from his own wife a repetition of her last
reply. “Tell the Wind and the Fire where to stop; not me!”
Customers entered, and the group was broken up. The English
customer paid for what he had had, perplexedly counted his change,
and asked, as a stranger, to be directed towards the National Palace.
Madame Defarge took him to the door, and put her arm on his, in
pointing out the road. The English customer was not without his reflections then, that it might be a good deed to seize that arm, lift it, and
strike under it sharp and deep.
But, he went his way, and was soon swallowed up in the shadow of
the prison wall. At the appointed hour, he emerged from it to present
himself in Mr. Lorry’s room again, where he found the old gentleman
walking to and fro in restless anxiety. He said he had been with Lucie
until just now, and had only left her for a few minutes, to come and
keep his appointment. Her father had not been seen, since he quitted
the banking-house towards four o’clock. She had some faint hopes that
his mediation might save Charles, but they were very slight. He had
been more than five hours gone: where could he be?
Mr. Lorry waited until ten; but, Doctor Manette not returning, and
he being unwilling to leave Lucie any longer, it was arranged that he
should go back to her, and come to the banking-house again at midnight.
In the meanwhile, Carton would wait alone by the fire for the Doctor.
He waited and waited, and the clock struck twelve; but Doctor
299
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
Manette did not come back. Mr. Lorry returned, and found no tidings
of him, and brought none. Where could he be?
They were discussing this question, and were almost building up
some weak structure of hope on his prolonged absence, when they heard
him on the stairs. The instant he entered the room, it was plain that all
was lost.
Whether he had really been to any one, or whether he had been all
that time traversing the streets, was never known. As he stood staring
at them, they asked him no question, for his face told them everything.
“I cannot find it,” said he, “and I must have it. Where is it?”
His head and throat were bare, and, as he spoke with a helpless look
straying all around, he took his coat off, and let it drop on the floor.
“Where is my bench? I have been looking everywhere for my bench,
and I can’t find it. What have they done with my work? Time presses: I
must finish those shoes.”
They looked at one another, and their hearts died within them.
“Come, come!” said he, in a whimpering miserable way; “let me get
to work. Give me my work.”
Receiving no answer, he tore his hair, and beat his feet upon the
ground, like a distracted child.
“Don’t torture a poor forlorn wretch,” he implored them, with a
dreadful cry; “but give me my work! What is to become of us, if those
shoes are not done to-night?”
Lost, utterly lost!
It was so clearly beyond hope to reason with him, or try to restore
him, that—as if by agreement—they each put a hand upon his shoulder,
and soothed him to sit down before the fire, with a promise that he
should have his work presently. He sank into the chair, and brooded
over the embers, and shed tears. As if all that had happened since the
garret time were a momentary fancy, or a dream, Mr. Lorry saw him
shrink into the exact figure that Defarge had had in keeping.
Affected, and impressed with terror as they both were, by this spectacle of ruin, it was not a time to yield to such emotions. His lonely
daughter, bereft of her final hope and reliance, appealed to them both
too strongly. Again, as if by agreement, they looked at one another with
one meaning in their faces. Carton was the first to speak:
“The last chance is gone: it was not much. Yes; he had better be
taken to her. But, before you go, will you, for a moment, steadily attend
to me? Don’t ask me why I make the stipulations I am going to make,
300
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
and exact the promise I am going to exact; I have a reason—a good
one.”
“I do not doubt it,” answered Mr. Lorry. “Say on.”
The figure in the chair between them, was all the time monotonously
rocking itself to and fro, and moaning. They spoke in such a tone as
they would have used if they had been watching by a sick-bed in the
night.
Carton stooped to pick up the coat, which lay almost entangling his
feet. As he did so, a small case in which the Doctor was accustomed to
carry the lists of his day’s duties, fell lightly on the floor. Carton took it
up, and there was a folded paper in it. “We should look at this!” he said.
Mr. Lorry nodded his consent. He opened it, and exclaimed, “Thank
God!”
“What is it?” asked Mr. Lorry, eagerly.
“A moment! Let me speak of it in its place. First,” he put his hand
in his coat, and took another paper from it, “that is the certificate which
enables me to pass out of this city. Look at it. You see—Sydney Carton,
an Englishman?”
Mr. Lorry held it open in his hand, gazing in his earnest face.
“Keep it for me until to-morrow. I shall see him to-morrow, you
remember, and I had better not take it into the prison.”
“Why not?”
“I don’t know; I prefer not to do so. Now, take this paper that Doctor Manette has carried about him. It is a similar certificate, enabling
him and his daughter and her child, at any time, to pass the barrier and
the frontier! You see?”
“Yes!”
“Perhaps he obtained it as his last and utmost precaution against
evil, yesterday. When is it dated? But no matter; don’t stay to look; put
it up carefully with mine and your own. Now, observe! I never doubted
until within this hour or two, that he had, or could have such a paper.
It is good, until recalled. But it may be soon recalled, and, I have reason
to think, will be.”
“They are not in danger?”
“They are in great danger. They are in danger of denunciation by
Madame Defarge. I know it from her own lips. I have overheard words
of that woman’s, to-night, which have presented their danger to me in
strong colours. I have lost no time, and since then, I have seen the spy.
He confirms me. He knows that a wood-sawyer, living by the prison
301
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
wall, is under the control of the Defarges, and has been rehearsed by
Madame Defarge as to his having seen Her”—he never mentioned Lucie’s name—“making signs and signals to prisoners. It is easy to foresee
that the pretence will be the common one, a prison plot, and that it will
involve her life—and perhaps her child’s—and perhaps her father’s—for
both have been seen with her at that place. Don’t look so horrified. You
will save them all.”
“Heaven grant I may, Carton! But how?”
“I am going to tell you how. It will depend on you, and it could
depend on no better man. This new denunciation will certainly not
take place until after to-morrow; probably not until two or three days
afterwards; more probably a week afterwards. You know it is a capital
crime, to mourn for, or sympathise with, a victim of the Guillotine. She
and her father would unquestionably be guilty of this crime, and this
woman (the inveteracy of whose pursuit cannot be described) would
wait to add that strength to her case, and make herself doubly sure.
You follow me?”
“So attentively, and with so much confidence in what you say, that
for the moment I lose sight,” touching the back of the Doctor’s chair,
even of this distress.“
“You have money, and can buy the means of travelling to the seacoast as quickly as the journey can be made. Your preparations have
been completed for some days, to return to England. Early to-morrow
have your horses ready, so that they may be in starting trim at two
o’clock in the afternoon.”
“It shall be done!”
His manner was so fervent and inspiring, that Mr. Lorry caught the
flame, and was as quick as youth.
“You are a noble heart. Did I say we could depend upon no better
man? Tell her, to-night, what you know of her danger as involving
her child and her father. Dwell upon that, for she would lay her own
fair head beside her husband’s cheerfully.” He faltered for an instant;
then went on as before. “For the sake of her child and her father, press
upon her the necessity of leaving Paris, with them and you, at that hour.
Tell her that it was her husband’s last arrangement. Tell her that more
depends upon it than she dare believe, or hope. You think that her
father, even in this sad state, will submit himself to her; do you not?”
“I am sure of it.”
“I thought so. Quietly and steadily have all these arrangements
302
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
made in the courtyard here, even to the taking of your own seat in
the carriage. The moment I come to you, take me in, and drive away.”
“I understand that I wait for you under all circumstances?”
“You have my certificate in your hand with the rest, you know, and
will reserve my place. Wait for nothing but to have my place occupied,
and then for England!”
“Why, then,” said Mr. Lorry, grasping his eager but so firm and
steady hand, “it does not all depend on one old man, but I shall have a
young and ardent man at my side.”
“By the help of Heaven you shall! Promise me solemnly that nothing
will influence you to alter the course on which we now stand pledged to
one another.”
“Nothing, Carton.”
“Remember these words to-morrow: change the course, or delay in
it—for any reason—and no life can possibly be saved, and many lives
must inevitably be sacrificed.”
“I will remember them. I hope to do my part faithfully.”
“And I hope to do mine. Now, good bye!”
Though he said it with a grave smile of earnestness, and though
he even put the old man’s hand to his lips, he did not part from him
then. He helped him so far to arouse the rocking figure before the dying
embers, as to get a cloak and hat put upon it, and to tempt it forth
to find where the bench and work were hidden that it still moaningly
besought to have. He walked on the other side of it and protected it to
the courtyard of the house where the afflicted heart—so happy in the
memorable time when he had revealed his own desolate heart to it—
outwatched the awful night. He entered the courtyard and remained
there for a few moments alone, looking up at the light in the window of
her room. Before he went away, he breathed a blessing towards it, and
a Farewell.
Chapter 13
Fifty-two
In the black prison of the Conciergerie, the doomed of the day awaited
their fate. They were in number as the weeks of the year. Fifty-two
were to roll that afternoon on the life-tide of the city to the boundless
303
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
everlasting sea. Before their cells were quit of them, new occupants were
appointed; before their blood ran into the blood spilled yesterday, the
blood that was to mingle with theirs to-morrow was already set apart.
Two score and twelve were told off. From the farmer-general of seventy, whose riches could not buy his life, to the seamstress of twenty,
whose poverty and obscurity could not save her. Physical diseases, engendered in the vices and neglects of men, will seize on victims of all
degrees; and the frightful moral disorder, born of unspeakable suffering,
intolerable oppression, and heartless indifference, smote equally without distinction.
Charles Darnay, alone in a cell, had sustained himself with no flattering delusion since he came to it from the Tribunal. In every line of the
narrative he had heard, he had heard his condemnation. He had fully
comprehended that no personal influence could possibly save him, that
he was virtually sentenced by the millions, and that units could avail
him nothing.
Nevertheless, it was not easy, with the face of his beloved wife fresh
before him, to compose his mind to what it must bear. His hold on life
was strong, and it was very, very hard, to loosen; by gradual efforts and
degrees unclosed a little here, it clenched the tighter there; and when
he brought his strength to bear on that hand and it yielded, this was
closed again. There was a hurry, too, in all his thoughts, a turbulent
and heated working of his heart, that contended against resignation. If,
for a moment, he did feel resigned, then his wife and child who had to
live after him, seemed to protest and to make it a selfish thing.
But, all this was at first. Before long, the consideration that there was
no disgrace in the fate he must meet, and that numbers went the same
road wrongfully, and trod it firmly every day, sprang up to stimulate
him. Next followed the thought that much of the future peace of mind
enjoyable by the dear ones, depended on his quiet fortitude. So, by
degrees he calmed into the better state, when he could raise his thoughts
much higher, and draw comfort down.
Before it had set in dark on the night of his condemnation, he had
travelled thus far on his last way. Being allowed to purchase the means
of writing, and a light, he sat down to write until such time as the prison
lamps should be extinguished.
He wrote a long letter to Lucie, showing her that he had known
nothing of her father’s imprisonment, until he had heard of it from herself, and that he had been as ignorant as she of his father’s and uncle’s
304
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
responsibility for that misery, until the paper had been read. He had
already explained to her that his concealment from herself of the name
he had relinquished, was the one condition—fully intelligible now—that
her father had attached to their betrothal, and was the one promise he
had still exacted on the morning of their marriage. He entreated her, for
her father’s sake, never to seek to know whether her father had become
oblivious of the existence of the paper, or had had it recalled to him
(for the moment, or for good), by the story of the Tower, on that old
Sunday under the dear old plane-tree in the garden. If he had preserved
any definite remembrance of it, there could be no doubt that he had
supposed it destroyed with the Bastille, when he had found no mention
of it among the relics of prisoners which the populace had discovered
there, and which had been described to all the world. He besought her—
though he added that he knew it was needless—to console her father, by
impressing him through every tender means she could think of, with the
truth that he had done nothing for which he could justly reproach himself, but had uniformly forgotten himself for their joint sakes. Next to
her preservation of his own last grateful love and blessing, and her overcoming of her sorrow, to devote herself to their dear child, he adjured
her, as they would meet in Heaven, to comfort her father.
To her father himself, he wrote in the same strain; but, he told her
father that he expressly confided his wife and child to his care. And he
told him this, very strongly, with the hope of rousing him from any despondency or dangerous retrospect towards which he foresaw he might
be tending.
To Mr. Lorry, he commended them all, and explained his worldly
affairs. That done, with many added sentences of grateful friendship
and warm attachment, all was done. He never thought of Carton. His
mind was so full of the others, that he never once thought of him.
He had time to finish these letters before the lights were put out.
When he lay down on his straw bed, he thought he had done with this
world.
But, it beckoned him back in his sleep, and showed itself in shining
forms. Free and happy, back in the old house in Soho (though it had
nothing in it like the real house), unaccountably released and light of
heart, he was with Lucie again, and she told him it was all a dream, and
he had never gone away. A pause of forgetfulness, and then he had even
suffered, and had come back to her, dead and at peace, and yet there
was no difference in him. Another pause of oblivion, and he awoke in
305
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
the sombre morning, unconscious where he was or what had happened,
until it flashed upon his mind, “this is the day of my death!”
Thus, had he come through the hours, to the day when the fifty-two
heads were to fall. And now, while he was composed, and hoped that
he could meet the end with quiet heroism, a new action began in his
waking thoughts, which was very difficult to master.
He had never seen the instrument that was to terminate his life. How
high it was from the ground, how many steps it had, where he would be
stood, how he would be touched, whether the touching hands would be
dyed red, which way his face would be turned, whether he would be the
first, or might be the last: these and many similar questions, in nowise
directed by his will, obtruded themselves over and over again, countless
times. Neither were they connected with fear: he was conscious of no
fear. Rather, they originated in a strange besetting desire to know what
to do when the time came; a desire gigantically disproportionate to the
few swift moments to which it referred; a wondering that was more like
the wondering of some other spirit within his, than his own.
The hours went on as he walked to and fro, and the clocks struck the
numbers he would never hear again. Nine gone for ever, ten gone for
ever, eleven gone for ever, twelve coming on to pass away. After a hard
contest with that eccentric action of thought which had last perplexed
him, he had got the better of it. He walked up and down, softly repeating their names to himself. The worst of the strife was over. He could
walk up and down, free from distracting fancies, praying for himself
and for them.
Twelve gone for ever.
He had been apprised that the final hour was Three, and he knew he
would be summoned some time earlier, inasmuch as the tumbrils jolted
heavily and slowly through the streets. Therefore, he resolved to keep
Two before his mind, as the hour, and so to strengthen himself in the
interval that he might be able, after that time, to strengthen others.
Walking regularly to and fro with his arms folded on his breast, a
very different man from the prisoner, who had walked to and fro at La
Force, he heard One struck away from him, without surprise. The hour
had measured like most other hours. Devoutly thankful to Heaven for
his recovered self-possession, he thought, “There is but another now,”
and turned to walk again.
Footsteps in the stone passage outside the door. He stopped.
The key was put in the lock, and turned. Before the door was opened,
306
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
or as it opened, a man said in a low voice, in English: “He has never
seen me here; I have kept out of his way. Go you in alone; I wait near.
Lose no time!”
The door was quickly opened and closed, and there stood before
him face to face, quiet, intent upon him, with the light of a smile on his
features, and a cautionary finger on his lip, Sydney Carton.
There was something so bright and remarkable in his look, that, for
the first moment, the prisoner misdoubted him to be an apparition of
his own imagining. But, he spoke, and it was his voice; he took the
prisoner’s hand, and it was his real grasp.
“Of all the people upon earth, you least expected to see me?” he
said.
“I could not believe it to be you. I can scarcely believe it now.
You are not”—the apprehension came suddenly into his mind—“a prisoner?”
“No. I am accidentally possessed of a power over one of the keepers
here, and in virtue of it I stand before you. I come from her—your wife,
dear Darnay.”
The prisoner wrung his hand.
“I bring you a request from her.”
“What is it?”
“A most earnest, pressing, and emphatic entreaty, addressed to you
in the most pathetic tones of the voice so dear to you, that you well
remember.”
The prisoner turned his face partly aside.
“You have no time to ask me why I bring it, or what it means; I have
no time to tell you. You must comply with it—take off those boots you
wear, and draw on these of mine.”
There was a chair against the wall of the cell, behind the prisoner.
Carton, pressing forward, had already, with the speed of lightning, got
him down into it, and stood over him, barefoot.
“Draw on these boots of mine. Put your hands to them; put your
will to them. Quick!”
“Carton, there is no escaping from this place; it never can be done.
You will only die with me. It is madness.”
“It would be madness if I asked you to escape; but do I? When I
ask you to pass out at that door, tell me it is madness and remain here.
Change that cravat for this of mine, that coat for this of mine. While
you do it, let me take this ribbon from your hair, and shake out your
307
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
hair like this of mine!”
With wonderful quickness, and with a strength both of will and action, that appeared quite supernatural, he forced all these changes upon
him. The prisoner was like a young child in his hands.
“Carton! Dear Carton! It is madness. It cannot be accomplished,
it never can be done, it has been attempted, and has always failed. I
implore you not to add your death to the bitterness of mine.”
“Do I ask you, my dear Darnay, to pass the door? When I ask that,
refuse. There are pen and ink and paper on this table. Is your hand
steady enough to write?”
“It was when you came in.”
“Steady it again, and write what I shall dictate. Quick, friend,
quick!”
Pressing his hand to his bewildered head, Darnay sat down at the
table. Carton, with his right hand in his breast, stood close beside him.
“Write exactly as I speak.”
“To whom do I address it?”
“To no one.” Carton still had his hand in his breast.
“Do I date it?”
“No.”
The prisoner looked up, at each question. Carton, standing over
him with his hand in his breast, looked down.
“ ‘If you remember,’ ” said Carton, dictating, “ ‘the words that
passed between us, long ago, you will readily comprehend this when
you see it. You do remember them, I know. It is not in your nature to
forget them.’ ”
He was drawing his hand from his breast; the prisoner chancing to
look up in his hurried wonder as he wrote, the hand stopped, closing
upon something.
“Have you written ‘forget them’?” Carton asked.
“I have. Is that a weapon in your hand?”
“No; I am not armed.”
“What is it in your hand?”
“You shall know directly. Write on; there are but a few words more.”
He dictated again. “ ‘I am thankful that the time has come, when I can
prove them. That I do so is no subject for regret or grief.’ ” As he said
these words with his eyes fixed on the writer, his hand slowly and softly
moved down close to the writer’s face.
The pen dropped from Darnay’s fingers on the table, and he looked
308
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
about him vacantly.
“What vapour is that?” he asked.
“Vapour?”
“Something that crossed me?”
“I am conscious of nothing; there can be nothing here. Take up the
pen and finish. Hurry, hurry!”
As if his memory were impaired, or his faculties disordered, the prisoner made an effort to rally his attention. As he looked at Carton
with clouded eyes and with an altered manner of breathing, Carton—
his hand again in his breast—looked steadily at him.
“Hurry, hurry!”
The prisoner bent over the paper, once more.
“ ‘If it had been otherwise;’ ” Carton’s hand was again watchfully
and softly stealing down; “ ‘I never should have used the longer opportunity. If it had been otherwise;’ ” the hand was at the prisoner’s face;
“ ‘I should but have had so much the more to answer for. If it had been
otherwise—’ ” Carton looked at the pen and saw it was trailing off into
unintelligible signs.
Carton’s hand moved back to his breast no more. The prisoner
sprang up with a reproachful look, but Carton’s hand was close and
firm at his nostrils, and Carton’s left arm caught him round the waist.
For a few seconds he faintly struggled with the man who had come to
lay down his life for him; but, within a minute or so, he was stretched
insensible on the ground.
Quickly, but with hands as true to the purpose as his heart was, Carton dressed himself in the clothes the prisoner had laid aside, combed
back his hair, and tied it with the ribbon the prisoner had worn. Then,
he softly called, “Enter there! Come in!” and the Spy presented himself.
“You see?” said Carton, looking up, as he kneeled on one knee
beside the insensible figure, putting the paper in the breast: “is your
hazard very great?”
“Mr. Carton,” the Spy answered, with a timid snap of his fingers,
“my hazard is not that, in the thick of business here, if you are true to
the whole of your bargain.”
“Don’t fear me. I will be true to the death.”
“You must be, Mr. Carton, if the tale of fifty-two is to be right. Being
made right by you in that dress, I shall have no fear.”
“Have no fear! I shall soon be out of the way of harming you, and
the rest will soon be far from here, please God! Now, get assistance and
309
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
take me to the coach.”
“You?” said the Spy nervously.
“Him, man, with whom I have exchanged. You go out at the gate
by which you brought me in?”
“Of course.”
“I was weak and faint when you brought me in, and I am fainter
now you take me out. The parting interview has overpowered me. Such
a thing has happened here, often, and too often. Your life is in your
own hands. Quick! Call assistance!”
“You swear not to betray me?” said the trembling Spy, as he paused
for a last moment.
“Man, man!” returned Carton, stamping his foot; “have I sworn
by no solemn vow already, to go through with this, that you waste the
precious moments now? Take him yourself to the courtyard you know
of, place him yourself in the carriage, show him yourself to Mr. Lorry,
tell him yourself to give him no restorative but air, and to remember my
words of last night, and his promise of last night, and drive away!”
The Spy withdrew, and Carton seated himself at the table, resting his
forehead on his hands. The Spy returned immediately, with two men.
“How, then?” said one of them, contemplating the fallen figure. “So
afflicted to find that his friend has drawn a prize in the lottery of Sainte
Guillotine?”
“A good patriot,” said the other, “could hardly have been more afflicted if the Aristocrat had drawn a blank.”
They raised the unconscious figure, placed it on a litter they had
brought to the door, and bent to carry it away.
“The time is short, Evremonde,” said the Spy, in a warning voice.
“I know it well,” answered Carton. “Be careful of my friend, I
entreat you, and leave me.”
“Come, then, my children,” said Barsad. “Lift him, and come
away!”
The door closed, and Carton was left alone. Straining his powers of
listening to the utmost, he listened for any sound that might denote suspicion or alarm. There was none. Keys turned, doors clashed, footsteps
passed along distant passages: no cry was raised, or hurry made, that
seemed unusual. Breathing more freely in a little while, he sat down at
the table, and listened again until the clock struck Two.
Sounds that he was not afraid of, for he divined their meaning, then
began to be audible. Several doors were opened in succession, and fi310
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
nally his own. A gaoler, with a list in his hand, looked in, merely saying,
“Follow me, Evremonde!” and he followed into a large dark room, at a
distance. It was a dark winter day, and what with the shadows within,
and what with the shadows without, he could but dimly discern the
others who were brought there to have their arms bound. Some were
standing; some seated. Some were lamenting, and in restless motion;
but, these were few. The great majority were silent and still, looking
fixedly at the ground.
As he stood by the wall in a dim corner, while some of the fiftytwo were brought in after him, one man stopped in passing, to embrace
him, as having a knowledge of him. It thrilled him with a great dread
of discovery; but the man went on. A very few moments after that, a
young woman, with a slight girlish form, a sweet spare face in which
there was no vestige of colour, and large widely opened patient eyes,
rose from the seat where he had observed her sitting, and came to speak
to him.
“Citizen Evremonde,” she said, touching him with her cold hand. “I
am a poor little seamstress, who was with you in La Force.”
He murmured for answer: “True. I forget what you were accused
of?”
“Plots. Though the just Heaven knows that I am innocent of any. Is
it likely? Who would think of plotting with a poor little weak creature
like me?”
The forlorn smile with which she said it, so touched him, that tears
started from his eyes.
“I am not afraid to die, Citizen Evremonde, but I have done nothing.
I am not unwilling to die, if the Republic which is to do so much good
to us poor, will profit by my death; but I do not know how that can be,
Citizen Evremonde. Such a poor weak little creature!”
As the last thing on earth that his heart was to warm and soften to,
it warmed and softened to this pitiable girl.
“I heard you were released, Citizen Evremonde. I hoped it was
true?”
“It was. But, I was again taken and condemned.”
“If I may ride with you, Citizen Evremonde, will you let me hold
your hand? I am not afraid, but I am little and weak, and it will give
me more courage.”
As the patient eyes were lifted to his face, he saw a sudden doubt in
them, and then astonishment. He pressed the work-worn, hunger-worn
311
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
young fingers, and touched his lips.
“Are you dying for him?” she whispered.
“And his wife and child. Hush! Yes.”
“O you will let me hold your brave hand, stranger?”
“Hush! Yes, my poor sister; to the last.”
The same shadows that are falling on the prison, are falling, in that
same hour of the early afternoon, on the Barrier with the crowd about
it, when a coach going out of Paris drives up to be examined.
“Who goes here? Whom have we within? Papers!”
The papers are handed out, and read.
“Alexandre Manette. Physician. French. Which is he?”
This is he; this helpless, inarticulately murmuring, wandering old
man pointed out.
“Apparently the Citizen-Doctor is not in his right mind? The
Revolution-fever will have been too much for him?”
Greatly too much for him.
“Hah! Many suffer with it. Lucie. His daughter. French. Which is
she?”
This is she.
“Apparently it must be. Lucie, the wife of Evremonde; is it not?”
It is.
“Hah! Evremonde has an assignation elsewhere. Lucie, her child.
English. This is she?”
She and no other.
“Kiss me, child of Evremonde. Now, thou hast kissed a good Republican; something new in thy family; remember it! Sydney Carton.
Advocate. English. Which is he?”
He lies here, in this corner of the carriage. He, too, is pointed out.
“Apparently the English advocate is in a swoon?”
It is hoped he will recover in the fresher air. It is represented that
he is not in strong health, and has separated sadly from a friend who is
under the displeasure of the Republic.
“Is that all? It is not a great deal, that! Many are under the displeasure of the Republic, and must look out at the little window. Jarvis
Lorry. Banker. English. Which is he?”
“I am he. Necessarily, being the last.”
It is Jarvis Lorry who has replied to all the previous questions. It is
Jarvis Lorry who has alighted and stands with his hand on the coach
door, replying to a group of officials. They leisurely walk round the
312
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
carriage and leisurely mount the box, to look at what little luggage
it carries on the roof; the country-people hanging about, press nearer
to the coach doors and greedily stare in; a little child, carried by its
mother, has its short arm held out for it, that it may touch the wife of
an aristocrat who has gone to the Guillotine.
“Behold your papers, Jarvis Lorry, countersigned.”
“One can depart, citizen?”
“One can depart. Forward, my postilions! A good journey!”
“I salute you, citizens.—And the first danger passed!”
These are again the words of Jarvis Lorry, as he clasps his hands, and
looks upward. There is terror in the carriage, there is weeping, there is
the heavy breathing of the insensible traveller.
“Are we not going too slowly? Can they not be induced to go
faster?” asks Lucie, clinging to the old man.
“It would seem like flight, my darling. I must not urge them too
much; it would rouse suspicion.”
“Look back, look back, and see if we are pursued!”
“The road is clear, my dearest. So far, we are not pursued.”
Houses in twos and threes pass by us, solitary farms, ruinous buildings, dye-works, tanneries, and the like, open country, avenues of leafless trees. The hard uneven pavement is under us, the soft deep mud
is on either side. Sometimes, we strike into the skirting mud, to avoid
the stones that clatter us and shake us; sometimes, we stick in ruts and
sloughs there. The agony of our impatience is then so great, that in
our wild alarm and hurry we are for getting out and running—hiding—
doing anything but stopping.
Out of the open country, in again among ruinous buildings, solitary
farms, dye-works, tanneries, and the like, cottages in twos and threes,
avenues of leafless trees. Have these men deceived us, and taken us back
by another road? Is not this the same place twice over? Thank Heaven,
no. A village. Look back, look back, and see if we are pursued! Hush!
the posting-house.
Leisurely, our four horses are taken out; leisurely, the coach stands
in the little street, bereft of horses, and with no likelihood upon it of
ever moving again; leisurely, the new horses come into visible existence,
one by one; leisurely, the new postilions follow, sucking and plaiting
the lashes of their whips; leisurely, the old postilions count their money,
make wrong additions, and arrive at dissatisfied results. All the time,
our overfraught hearts are beating at a rate that would far outstrip the
313
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
fastest gallop of the fastest horses ever foaled.
At length the new postilions are in their saddles, and the old are left
behind. We are through the village, up the hill, and down the hill, and
on the low watery grounds. Suddenly, the postilions exchange speech
with animated gesticulation, and the horses are pulled up, almost on
their haunches. We are pursued?
“Ho! Within the carriage there. Speak then!”
“What is it?” asks Mr. Lorry, looking out at window.
“How many did they say?”
“I do not understand you.”
“—At the last post. How many to the Guillotine to-day?”
“Fifty-two.”
“I said so! A brave number! My fellow-citizen here would have
it forty-two; ten more heads are worth having. The Guillotine goes
handsomely. I love it. Hi forward. Whoop!”
The night comes on dark. He moves more; he is beginning to revive,
and to speak intelligibly; he thinks they are still together; he asks him,
by his name, what he has in his hand. O pity us, kind Heaven, and help
us! Look out, look out, and see if we are pursued.
The wind is rushing after us, and the clouds are flying after us, and
the moon is plunging after us, and the whole wild night is in pursuit of
us; but, so far, we are pursued by nothing else.
Chapter 14
The Knitting Done
In that same juncture of time when the Fifty-Two awaited their fate
Madame Defarge held darkly ominous council with The Vengeance and
Jacques Three of the Revolutionary Jury. Not in the wine-shop did
Madame Defarge confer with these ministers, but in the shed of the
wood-sawyer, erst a mender of roads. The sawyer himself did not participate in the conference, but abided at a little distance, like an outer
satellite who was not to speak until required, or to offer an opinion
until invited.
“But our Defarge,” said Jacques Three, “is undoubtedly a good Republican? Eh?”
314
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
“There is no better,” the voluble Vengeance protested in her shrill
notes, “in France.”
“Peace, little Vengeance,” said Madame Defarge, laying her hand
with a slight frown on her lieutenant’s lips, “hear me speak. My husband, fellow-citizen, is a good Republican and a bold man; he has deserved well of the Republic, and possesses its confidence. But my husband has his weaknesses, and he is so weak as to relent towards this
Doctor.”
“It is a great pity,” croaked Jacques Three, dubiously shaking his
head, with his cruel fingers at his hungry mouth; “it is not quite like a
good citizen; it is a thing to regret.”
“See you,” said madame, “I care nothing for this Doctor, I. He may
wear his head or lose it, for any interest I have in him; it is all one to
me. But, the Evremonde people are to be exterminated, and the wife
and child must follow the husband and father.”
“She has a fine head for it,” croaked Jacques Three. “I have seen
blue eyes and golden hair there, and they looked charming when Samson held them up.” Ogre that he was, he spoke like an epicure.
Madame Defarge cast down her eyes, and reflected a little.
“The child also,” observed Jacques Three, with a meditative enjoyment of his words, “has golden hair and blue eyes. And we seldom have
a child there. It is a pretty sight!”
“In a word,” said Madame Defarge, coming out of her short abstraction, “I cannot trust my husband in this matter. Not only do I feel, since
last night, that I dare not confide to him the details of my projects; but
also I feel that if I delay, there is danger of his giving warning, and then
they might escape.”
“That must never be,” croaked Jacques Three; “no one must escape.
We have not half enough as it is. We ought to have six score a day.”
“In a word,” Madame Defarge went on, “my husband has not my
reason for pursuing this family to annihilation, and I have not his reason
for regarding this Doctor with any sensibility. I must act for myself,
therefore. Come hither, little citizen.”
The wood-sawyer, who held her in the respect, and himself in the
submission, of mortal fear, advanced with his hand to his red cap.
“Touching those signals, little citizen,” said Madame Defarge,
sternly, “that she made to the prisoners; you are ready to bear witness
to them this very day?”
“Ay, ay, why not!” cried the sawyer. “Every day, in all weathers,
315
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
from two to four, always signalling, sometimes with the little one, sometimes without. I know what I know. I have seen with my eyes.”
He made all manner of gestures while he spoke, as if in incidental
imitation of some few of the great diversity of signals that he had never
seen.
“Clearly plots,” said Jacques Three. “Transparently!”
“There is no doubt of the Jury?” inquired Madame Defarge, letting
her eyes turn to him with a gloomy smile.
“Rely upon the patriotic Jury, dear citizeness. I answer for my fellowJurymen.”
“Now, let me see,” said Madame Defarge, pondering again. “Yet
once more! Can I spare this Doctor to my husband? I have no feeling
either way. Can I spare him?”
“He would count as one head,” observed Jacques Three, in a low
voice. “We really have not heads enough; it would be a pity, I think.”
“He was signalling with her when I saw her,” argued Madame Defarge; “I cannot speak of one without the other; and I must not be silent,
and trust the case wholly to him, this little citizen here. For, I am not a
bad witness.”
The Vengeance and Jacques Three vied with each other in their fervent protestations that she was the most admirable and marvellous of
witnesses. The little citizen, not to be outdone, declared her to be a
celestial witness.
“He must take his chance,” said Madame Defarge. “No, I cannot
spare him! You are engaged at three o’clock; you are going to see the
batch of to-day executed.—You?”
The question was addressed to the wood-sawyer, who hurriedly
replied in the affirmative: seizing the occasion to add that he was the
most ardent of Republicans, and that he would be in effect the most desolate of Republicans, if anything prevented him from enjoying the pleasure of smoking his afternoon pipe in the contemplation of the droll
national barber. He was so very demonstrative herein, that he might
have been suspected (perhaps was, by the dark eyes that looked contemptuously at him out of Madame Defarge’s head) of having his small
individual fears for his own personal safety, every hour in the day.
“I,” said madame, “am equally engaged at the same place. After it
is over-say at eight to-night—come you to me, in Saint Antoine, and we
will give information against these people at my Section.”
The wood-sawyer said he would be proud and flattered to attend
316
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
the citizeness. The citizeness looking at him, he became embarrassed,
evaded her glance as a small dog would have done, retreated among his
wood, and hid his confusion over the handle of his saw.
Madame Defarge beckoned the Juryman and The Vengeance a little
nearer to the door, and there expounded her further views to them thus:
“She will now be at home, awaiting the moment of his death. She
will be mourning and grieving. She will be in a state of mind to impeach
the justice of the Republic. She will be full of sympathy with its enemies.
I will go to her.”
“What an admirable woman; what an adorable woman!” exclaimed
Jacques Three, rapturously. “Ah, my cherished!” cried The Vengeance;
and embraced her.
“Take you my knitting,” said Madame Defarge, placing it in her
lieutenant’s hands, “and have it ready for me in my usual seat. Keep
me my usual chair. Go you there, straight, for there will probably be a
greater concourse than usual, to-day.”
“I willingly obey the orders of my Chief,” said The Vengeance with
alacrity, and kissing her cheek. “You will not be late?”
“I shall be there before the commencement.”
“And before the tumbrils arrive. Be sure you are there, my soul,”
said The Vengeance, calling after her, for she had already turned into
the street, “before the tumbrils arrive!”
Madame Defarge slightly waved her hand, to imply that she heard,
and might be relied upon to arrive in good time, and so went through
the mud, and round the corner of the prison wall. The Vengeance and
the Juryman, looking after her as she walked away, were highly appreciative of her fine figure, and her superb moral endowments.
There were many women at that time, upon whom the time laid a
dreadfully disfiguring hand; but, there was not one among them more
to be dreaded than this ruthless woman, now taking her way along the
streets. Of a strong and fearless character, of shrewd sense and readiness,
of great determination, of that kind of beauty which not only seems to
impart to its possessor firmness and animosity, but to strike into others
an instinctive recognition of those qualities; the troubled time would
have heaved her up, under any circumstances. But, imbued from her
childhood with a brooding sense of wrong, and an inveterate hatred of
a class, opportunity had developed her into a tigress. She was absolutely
without pity. If she had ever had the virtue in her, it had quite gone out
of her.
317
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
It was nothing to her, that an innocent man was to die for the sins
of his forefathers; she saw, not him, but them. It was nothing to her,
that his wife was to be made a widow and his daughter an orphan; that
was insufficient punishment, because they were her natural enemies and
her prey, and as such had no right to live. To appeal to her, was made
hopeless by her having no sense of pity, even for herself. If she had
been laid low in the streets, in any of the many encounters in which
she had been engaged, she would not have pitied herself; nor, if she had
been ordered to the axe to-morrow, would she have gone to it with any
softer feeling than a fierce desire to change places with the man who
sent here there.
Such a heart Madame Defarge carried under her rough robe. Carelessly worn, it was a becoming robe enough, in a certain weird way, and
her dark hair looked rich under her coarse red cap. Lying hidden in her
bosom, was a loaded pistol. Lying hidden at her waist, was a sharpened
dagger. Thus accoutred, and walking with the confident tread of such
a character, and with the supple freedom of a woman who had habitually walked in her girlhood, bare-foot and bare-legged, on the brown
sea-sand, Madame Defarge took her way along the streets.
Now, when the journey of the travelling coach, at that very moment
waiting for the completion of its load, had been planned out last night,
the difficulty of taking Miss Pross in it had much engaged Mr. Lorry’s
attention. It was not merely desirable to avoid overloading the coach,
but it was of the highest importance that the time occupied in examining
it and its passengers, should be reduced to the utmost; since their escape
might depend on the saving of only a few seconds here and there. Finally,
he had proposed, after anxious consideration, that Miss Pross and Jerry,
who were at liberty to leave the city, should leave it at three o’clock in
the lightest-wheeled conveyance known to that period. Unencumbered
with luggage, they would soon overtake the coach, and, passing it and
preceding it on the road, would order its horses in advance, and greatly
facilitate its progress during the precious hours of the night, when delay
was the most to be dreaded.
Seeing in this arrangement the hope of rendering real service in that
pressing emergency, Miss Pross hailed it with joy. She and Jerry had beheld the coach start, had known who it was that Solomon brought, had
passed some ten minutes in tortures of suspense, and were now concluding their arrangements to follow the coach, even as Madame Defarge,
taking her way through the streets, now drew nearer and nearer to the
318
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
else-deserted lodging in which they held their consultation.
“Now what do you think, Mr. Cruncher,” said Miss Pross, whose
agitation was so great that she could hardly speak, or stand, or move,
or live: “what do you think of our not starting from this courtyard?
Another carriage having already gone from here to-day, it might awaken
suspicion.”
“My opinion, miss,” returned Mr. Cruncher, “is as you’re right.
Likewise wot I’ll stand by you, right or wrong.”
“I am so distracted with fear and hope for our precious creatures,”
said Miss Pross, wildly crying, “that I am incapable of forming any plan.
Are you capable of forming any plan, my dear good Mr. Cruncher?”
“Respectin’ a future spear o’ life, miss,” returned Mr. Cruncher, “I
hope so. Respectin’ any present use o’ this here blessed old head o’ mind,
I think not. Would you do me the favour, miss, to take notice o’ two
promises and wows wot it is my wishes fur to record in this here crisis?”
“Oh, for gracious sake!” cried Miss Pross, still wildly crying,
“record them at once, and get them out of the way, like an excellent
man.”
“First,” said Mr. Cruncher, who was all in a tremble, and who spoke
with an ashy and solemn visage, “them poor things well out o’ this,
never no more will I do it, never no more!”
“I am quite sure, Mr. Cruncher,” returned Miss Pross, “that you
never will do it again, whatever it is, and I beg you not to think it
necessary to mention more particularly what it is.”
“No, miss,” returned Jerry, “it shall not be named to you. Second:
them poor things well out o’ this, and never no more will I interfere
with Mrs. Cruncher’s flopping, never no more!”
“Whatever housekeeping arrangement that may be,” said Miss
Pross, striving to dry her eyes and compose herself, “I have no doubt
it is best that Mrs. Cruncher should have it entirely under her own
superintendence.—O my poor darlings!”
“I go so far as to say, miss, moreover,” proceeded Mr. Cruncher, with
a most alarming tendency to hold forth as from a pulpit—“and let my
words be took down and took to Mrs. Cruncher through yourself—that
wot my opinions respectin’ flopping has undergone a change, and that
wot I only hope with all my heart as Mrs. Cruncher may be a flopping
at the present time.”
“There, there, there! I hope she is, my dear man,” cried the distracted Miss Pross, “and I hope she finds it answering her expectations.”
319
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
“Forbid it,” proceeded Mr. Cruncher, with additional solemnity, additional slowness, and additional tendency to hold forth and hold out,
“as anything wot I have ever said or done should be wisited on my
earnest wishes for them poor creeturs now! Forbid it as we shouldn’t
all flop (if it was anyways conwenient) to get ’em out o’ this here dismal
risk! Forbid it, miss! Wot I say, for-bid it!” This was Mr. Cruncher’s
conclusion after a protracted but vain endeavour to find a better one.
And still Madame Defarge, pursuing her way along the streets, came
nearer and nearer.
“If we ever get back to our native land,” said Miss Pross, “you may
rely upon my telling Mrs. Cruncher as much as I may be able to remember and understand of what you have so impressively said; and at
all events you may be sure that I shall bear witness to your being thoroughly in earnest at this dreadful time. Now, pray let us think! My
esteemed Mr. Cruncher, let us think!”
Still, Madame Defarge, pursuing her way along the streets, came
nearer and nearer.
“If you were to go before,” said Miss Pross, “and stop the vehicle and horses from coming here, and were to wait somewhere for me;
wouldn’t that be best?”
Mr. Cruncher thought it might be best.
“Where could you wait for me?” asked Miss Pross.
Mr. Cruncher was so bewildered that he could think of no locality
but Temple Bar. Alas! Temple Bar was hundreds of miles away, and
Madame Defarge was drawing very near indeed.
“By the cathedral door,” said Miss Pross. “Would it be much out of
the way, to take me in, near the great cathedral door between the two
towers?”
“No, miss,” answered Mr. Cruncher.
“Then, like the best of men,” said Miss Pross, “go to the postinghouse straight, and make that change.”
“I am doubtful,” said Mr. Cruncher, hesitating and shaking his head,
“about leaving of you, you see. We don’t know what may happen.”
“Heaven knows we don’t,” returned Miss Pross, “but have no fear
for me. Take me in at the cathedral, at Three o’Clock, or as near it as
you can, and I am sure it will be better than our going from here. I feel
certain of it. There! Bless you, Mr. Cruncher! Think-not of me, but of
the lives that may depend on both of us!”
This exordium, and Miss Pross’s two hands in quite agonised en320
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
treaty clasping his, decided Mr. Cruncher. With an encouraging nod or
two, he immediately went out to alter the arrangements, and left her by
herself to follow as she had proposed.
The having originated a precaution which was already in course of
execution, was a great relief to Miss Pross. The necessity of composing
her appearance so that it should attract no special notice in the streets,
was another relief. She looked at her watch, and it was twenty minutes
past two. She had no time to lose, but must get ready at once.
Afraid, in her extreme perturbation, of the loneliness of the deserted
rooms, and of half-imagined faces peeping from behind every open door
in them, Miss Pross got a basin of cold water and began laving her eyes,
which were swollen and red. Haunted by her feverish apprehensions,
she could not bear to have her sight obscured for a minute at a time by
the dripping water, but constantly paused and looked round to see that
there was no one watching her. In one of those pauses she recoiled and
cried out, for she saw a figure standing in the room.
The basin fell to the ground broken, and the water flowed to the feet
of Madame Defarge. By strange stern ways, and through much staining
blood, those feet had come to meet that water.
Madame Defarge looked coldly at her, and said, “The wife of Evremonde; where is she?”
It flashed upon Miss Pross’s mind that the doors were all standing
open, and would suggest the flight. Her first act was to shut them. There
were four in the room, and she shut them all. She then placed herself
before the door of the chamber which Lucie had occupied.
Madame Defarge’s dark eyes followed her through this rapid movement, and rested on her when it was finished. Miss Pross had nothing
beautiful about her; years had not tamed the wildness, or softened the
grimness, of her appearance; but, she too was a determined woman in
her different way, and she measured Madame Defarge with her eyes,
every inch.
“You might, from your appearance, be the wife of Lucifer,” said
Miss Pross, in her breathing. “Nevertheless, you shall not get the better
of me. I am an Englishwoman.”
Madame Defarge looked at her scornfully, but still with something
of Miss Pross’s own perception that they two were at bay. She saw a
tight, hard, wiry woman before her, as Mr. Lorry had seen in the same
figure a woman with a strong hand, in the years gone by. She knew full
well that Miss Pross was the family’s devoted friend; Miss Pross knew
321
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
full well that Madame Defarge was the family’s malevolent enemy.
“On my way yonder,” said Madame Defarge, with a slight movement of her hand towards the fatal spot, “where they reserve my chair
and my knitting for me, I am come to make my compliments to her in
passing. I wish to see her.”
“I know that your intentions are evil,” said Miss Pross, “and you
may depend upon it, I’ll hold my own against them.”
Each spoke in her own language; neither understood the other’s
words; both were very watchful, and intent to deduce from look and
manner, what the unintelligible words meant.
“It will do her no good to keep herself concealed from me at this
moment,” said Madame Defarge. “Good patriots will know what that
means. Let me see her. Go tell her that I wish to see her. Do you hear?”
“If those eyes of yours were bed-winches,” returned Miss Pross,
“and I was an English four-poster, they shouldn’t loose a splinter of me.
No, you wicked foreign woman; I am your match.”
Madame Defarge was not likely to follow these idiomatic remarks
in detail; but, she so far understood them as to perceive that she was set
at naught.
“Woman imbecile and pig-like!” said Madame Defarge, frowning.
“I take no answer from you. I demand to see her. Either tell her that I
demand to see her, or stand out of the way of the door and let me go to
her!” This, with an angry explanatory wave of her right arm.
“I little thought,” said Miss Pross, “that I should ever want to understand your nonsensical language; but I would give all I have, except
the clothes I wear, to know whether you suspect the truth, or any part
of it.”
Neither of them for a single moment released the other’s eyes.
Madame Defarge had not moved from the spot where she stood when
Miss Pross first became aware of her; but, she now advanced one step.
“I am a Briton,” said Miss Pross, “I am desperate. I don’t care an
English Twopence for myself. I know that the longer I keep you here,
the greater hope there is for my Ladybird. I’ll not leave a handful of
that dark hair upon your head, if you lay a finger on me!”
Thus Miss Pross, with a shake of her head and a flash of her eyes
between every rapid sentence, and every rapid sentence a whole breath.
Thus Miss Pross, who had never struck a blow in her life.
But, her courage was of that emotional nature that it brought the
irrepressible tears into her eyes. This was a courage that Madame De322
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
farge so little comprehended as to mistake for weakness. “Ha, ha!” she
laughed, “you poor wretch! What are you worth! I address myself to
that Doctor.” Then she raised her voice and called out, “Citizen Doctor! Wife of Evremonde! Child of Evremonde! Any person but this
miserable fool, answer the Citizeness Defarge!”
Perhaps the following silence, perhaps some latent disclosure in the
expression of Miss Pross’s face, perhaps a sudden misgiving apart from
either suggestion, whispered to Madame Defarge that they were gone.
Three of the doors she opened swiftly, and looked in.
“Those rooms are all in disorder, there has been hurried packing,
there are odds and ends upon the ground. There is no one in that room
behind you! Let me look.”
“Never!” said Miss Pross, who understood the request as perfectly
as Madame Defarge understood the answer.
“If they are not in that room, they are gone, and can be pursued and
brought back,” said Madame Defarge to herself.
“As long as you don’t know whether they are in that room or not,
you are uncertain what to do,” said Miss Pross to herself; “and you
shall not know that, if I can prevent your knowing it; and know that,
or not know that, you shall not leave here while I can hold you.”
“I have been in the streets from the first, nothing has stopped me,
I will tear you to pieces, but I will have you from that door,” said
Madame Defarge.
“We are alone at the top of a high house in a solitary courtyard,
we are not likely to be heard, and I pray for bodily strength to keep
you here, while every minute you are here is worth a hundred thousand
guineas to my darling,” said Miss Pross.
Madame Defarge made at the door. Miss Pross, on the instinct of
the moment, seized her round the waist in both her arms, and held her
tight. It was in vain for Madame Defarge to struggle and to strike; Miss
Pross, with the vigorous tenacity of love, always so much stronger than
hate, clasped her tight, and even lifted her from the floor in the struggle
that they had. The two hands of Madame Defarge buffeted and tore
her face; but, Miss Pross, with her head down, held her round the waist,
and clung to her with more than the hold of a drowning woman.
Soon, Madame Defarge’s hands ceased to strike, and felt at her encircled waist. “It is under my arm,” said Miss Pross, in smothered tones,
“you shall not draw it. I am stronger than you, I bless Heaven for it. I
hold you till one or other of us faints or dies!”
323
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
Madame Defarge’s hands were at her bosom. Miss Pross looked up,
saw what it was, struck at it, struck out a flash and a crash, and stood
alone—blinded with smoke.
All this was in a second. As the smoke cleared, leaving an awful
stillness, it passed out on the air, like the soul of the furious woman
whose body lay lifeless on the ground.
In the first fright and horror of her situation, Miss Pross passed the
body as far from it as she could, and ran down the stairs to call for
fruitless help. Happily, she bethought herself of the consequences of
what she did, in time to check herself and go back. It was dreadful to
go in at the door again; but, she did go in, and even went near it, to get
the bonnet and other things that she must wear. These she put on, out
on the staircase, first shutting and locking the door and taking away the
key. She then sat down on the stairs a few moments to breathe and to
cry, and then got up and hurried away.
By good fortune she had a veil on her bonnet, or she could hardly
have gone along the streets without being stopped. By good fortune,
too, she was naturally so peculiar in appearance as not to show disfigurement like any other woman. She needed both advantages, for the
marks of gripping fingers were deep in her face, and her hair was torn,
and her dress (hastily composed with unsteady hands) was clutched and
dragged a hundred ways.
In crossing the bridge, she dropped the door key in the river. Arriving at the cathedral some few minutes before her escort, and waiting
there, she thought, what if the key were already taken in a net, what if
it were identified, what if the door were opened and the remains discovered, what if she were stopped at the gate, sent to prison, and charged
with murder! In the midst of these fluttering thoughts, the escort appeared, took her in, and took her away.
“Is there any noise in the streets?” she asked him.
“The usual noises,” Mr. Cruncher replied; and looked surprised by
the question and by her aspect.
“I don’t hear you,” said Miss Pross. “What do you say?”
It was in vain for Mr. Cruncher to repeat what he said; Miss Pross
could not hear him. “So I’ll nod my head,” thought Mr. Cruncher,
amazed, “at all events she’ll see that.” And she did.
“Is there any noise in the streets now?” asked Miss Pross again,
presently.
Again Mr. Cruncher nodded his head.
324
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
“I don’t hear it.”
“Gone deaf in an hour?” said Mr. Cruncher, ruminating, with his
mind much disturbed; “wot’s come to her?”
“I feel,” said Miss Pross, “as if there had been a flash and a crash,
and that crash was the last thing I should ever hear in this life.”
“Blest if she ain’t in a queer condition!” said Mr. Cruncher, more
and more disturbed. “Wot can she have been a takin’, to keep her
courage up? Hark! There’s the roll of them dreadful carts! You can
hear that, miss?”
“I can hear,” said Miss Pross, seeing that he spoke to her, “nothing.
O, my good man, there was first a great crash, and then a great stillness, and that stillness seems to be fixed and unchangeable, never to be
broken any more as long as my life lasts.”
“If she don’t hear the roll of those dreadful carts, now very nigh
their journey’s end,” said Mr. Cruncher, glancing over his shoulder, “it’s
my opinion that indeed she never will hear anything else in this world.”
And indeed she never did.
Chapter 15
The Footsteps Die Out For Ever
Along the Paris streets, the death-carts rumble, hollow and harsh. Six
tumbrils carry the day’s wine to La Guillotine. All the devouring and
insatiate Monsters imagined since imagination could record itself, are
fused in the one realisation, Guillotine. And yet there is not in France,
with its rich variety of soil and climate, a blade, a leaf, a root, a sprig, a
peppercorn, which will grow to maturity under conditions more certain
than those that have produced this horror. Crush humanity out of shape
once more, under similar hammers, and it will twist itself into the same
tortured forms. Sow the same seed of rapacious license and oppression
over again, and it will surely yield the same fruit according to its kind.
Six tumbrils roll along the streets. Change these back again to what
they were, thou powerful enchanter, Time, and they shall be seen to be
the carriages of absolute monarchs, the equipages of feudal nobles, the
toilettes of flaring Jezebels, the churches that are not my father’s house
but dens of thieves, the huts of millions of starving peasants! No; the
great magician who majestically works out the appointed order of the
325
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
Creator, never reverses his transformations. “If thou be changed into
this shape by the will of God,” say the seers to the enchanted, in the wise
Arabian stories, “then remain so! But, if thou wear this form through
mere passing conjuration, then resume thy former aspect!” Changeless
and hopeless, the tumbrils roll along.
As the sombre wheels of the six carts go round, they seem to plough
up a long crooked furrow among the populace in the streets. Ridges of
faces are thrown to this side and to that, and the ploughs go steadily onward. So used are the regular inhabitants of the houses to the spectacle,
that in many windows there are no people, and in some the occupation
of the hands is not so much as suspended, while the eyes survey the
faces in the tumbrils. Here and there, the inmate has visitors to see the
sight; then he points his finger, with something of the complacency of
a curator or authorised exponent, to this cart and to this, and seems to
tell who sat here yesterday, and who there the day before.
Of the riders in the tumbrils, some observe these things, and all
things on their last roadside, with an impassive stare; others, with a
lingering interest in the ways of life and men. Some, seated with drooping heads, are sunk in silent despair; again, there are some so heedful of
their looks that they cast upon the multitude such glances as they have
seen in theatres, and in pictures. Several close their eyes, and think, or
try to get their straying thoughts together. Only one, and he a miserable
creature, of a crazed aspect, is so shattered and made drunk by horror,
that he sings, and tries to dance. Not one of the whole number appeals
by look or gesture, to the pity of the people.
There is a guard of sundry horsemen riding abreast of the tumbrils,
and faces are often turned up to some of them, and they are asked
some question. It would seem to be always the same question, for, it
is always followed by a press of people towards the third cart. The
horsemen abreast of that cart, frequently point out one man in it with
their swords. The leading curiosity is, to know which is he; he stands
at the back of the tumbril with his head bent down, to converse with a
mere girl who sits on the side of the cart, and holds his hand. He has no
curiosity or care for the scene about him, and always speaks to the girl.
Here and there in the long street of St. Honore, cries are raised against
him. If they move him at all, it is only to a quiet smile, as he shakes his
hair a little more loosely about his face. He cannot easily touch his face,
his arms being bound.
On the steps of a church, awaiting the coming-up of the tumbrils,
326
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
stands the Spy and prison-sheep. He looks into the first of them: not
there. He looks into the second: not there. He already asks himself,
“Has he sacrificed me?” when his face clears, as he looks into the third.
“Which is Evremonde?” says a man behind him.
“That. At the back there.”
“With his hand in the girl’s?”
“Yes.”
The man cries, “Down, Evremonde! To the Guillotine all aristocrats!
Down, Evremonde!”
“Hush, hush!” the Spy entreats him, timidly.
“And why not, citizen?”
“He is going to pay the forfeit: it will be paid in five minutes more.
Let him be at peace.”
But the man continuing to exclaim, “Down, Evremonde!” the face
of Evremonde is for a moment turned towards him. Evremonde then
sees the Spy, and looks attentively at him, and goes his way.
The clocks are on the stroke of three, and the furrow ploughed
among the populace is turning round, to come on into the place of
execution, and end. The ridges thrown to this side and to that, now
crumble in and close behind the last plough as it passes on, for all are
following to the Guillotine. In front of it, seated in chairs, as in a garden of public diversion, are a number of women, busily knitting. On
one of the fore-most chairs, stands The Vengeance, looking about for
her friend.
“Therese!” she cries, in her shrill tones. “Who has seen her? Therese
Defarge!”
“She never missed before,” says a knitting-woman of the sisterhood.
“No; nor will she miss now,” cries The Vengeance, petulantly.
“Therese.”
“Louder,” the woman recommends.
Ay! Louder, Vengeance, much louder, and still she will scarcely hear
thee. Louder yet, Vengeance, with a little oath or so added, and yet
it will hardly bring her. Send other women up and down to seek her,
lingering somewhere; and yet, although the messengers have done dread
deeds, it is questionable whether of their own wills they will go far
enough to find her!
“Bad Fortune!” cries The Vengeance, stamping her foot in the chair,
“and here are the tumbrils! And Evremonde will be despatched in a
wink, and she not here! See her knitting in my hand, and her empty
327
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
chair ready for her. I cry with vexation and disappointment!”
As The Vengeance descends from her elevation to do it, the tumbrils
begin to discharge their loads. The ministers of Sainte Guillotine are
robed and ready. Crash!—A head is held up, and the knitting-women
who scarcely lifted their eyes to look at it a moment ago when it could
think and speak, count One.
The second tumbril empties and moves on; the third comes up.
Crash!—And the knitting-women, never faltering or pausing in their
Work, count Two.
The supposed Evremonde descends, and the seamstress is lifted out
next after him. He has not relinquished her patient hand in getting out,
but still holds it as he promised. He gently places her with her back to
the crashing engine that constantly whirrs up and falls, and she looks
into his face and thanks him.
“But for you, dear stranger, I should not be so composed, for I am
naturally a poor little thing, faint of heart; nor should I have been able
to raise my thoughts to Him who was put to death, that we might have
hope and comfort here to-day. I think you were sent to me by Heaven.”
“Or you to me,” says Sydney Carton. “Keep your eyes upon me,
dear child, and mind no other object.”
“I mind nothing while I hold your hand. I shall mind nothing when
I let it go, if they are rapid.”
“They will be rapid. Fear not!”
The two stand in the fast-thinning throng of victims, but they speak
as if they were alone. Eye to eye, voice to voice, hand to hand, heart
to heart, these two children of the Universal Mother, else so wide apart
and differing, have come together on the dark highway, to repair home
together, and to rest in her bosom.
“Brave and generous friend, will you let me ask you one last question? I am very ignorant, and it troubles me—just a little.”
“Tell me what it is.”
“I have a cousin, an only relative and an orphan, like myself, whom
I love very dearly. She is five years younger than I, and she lives in a
farmer’s house in the south country. Poverty parted us, and she knows
nothing of my fate—for I cannot write—and if I could, how should I
tell her! It is better as it is.”
“Yes, yes: better as it is.”
“What I have been thinking as we came along, and what I am still
thinking now, as I look into your kind strong face which gives me so
328
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
much support, is this:—If the Republic really does good to the poor,
and they come to be less hungry, and in all ways to suffer less, she may
live a long time: she may even live to be old.”
“What then, my gentle sister?”
“Do you think:” the uncomplaining eyes in which there is so much
endurance, fill with tears, and the lips part a little more and tremble:
“that it will seem long to me, while I wait for her in the better land
where I trust both you and I will be mercifully sheltered?”
“It cannot be, my child; there is no Time there, and no trouble
there.”
“You comfort me so much! I am so ignorant. Am I to kiss you now?
Is the moment come?”
“Yes.”
She kisses his lips; he kisses hers; they solemnly bless each other.
The spare hand does not tremble as he releases it; nothing worse than
a sweet, bright constancy is in the patient face. She goes next before
him—is gone; the knitting-women count Twenty-Two.
“I am the Resurrection and the Life, saith the Lord: he that believeth
in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: and whosoever liveth and
believeth in me shall never die.”
The murmuring of many voices, the upturning of many faces, the
pressing on of many footsteps in the outskirts of the crowd, so that it
swells forward in a mass, like one great heave of water, all flashes away.
Twenty-Three.
They said of him, about the city that night, that it was the peacefullest man’s face ever beheld there. Many added that he looked sublime
and prophetic.
One of the most remarkable sufferers by the same axe—a woman—
had asked at the foot of the same scaffold, not long before, to be allowed
to write down the thoughts that were inspiring her. If he had given any
utterance to his, and they were prophetic, they would have been these:
“I see Barsad, and Cly, Defarge, The Vengeance, the Juryman, the
Judge, long ranks of the new oppressors who have risen on the destruction of the old, perishing by this retributive instrument, before it shall
cease out of its present use. I see a beautiful city and a brilliant people
rising from this abyss, and, in their struggles to be truly free, in their
triumphs and defeats, through long years to come, I see the evil of this
time and of the previous time of which this is the natural birth, gradually making expiation for itself and wearing out.

My father’s family name being Pirrip, and my christian name
Philip, my infant tongue could make of both names nothing longer
or more explicit than Pip. So, I called myself Pip, and came to be
called Pip.
I give Pirrip as my father’s family name, on the authority of his
tombstone and my sister––Mrs. Joe Gargery, who married the blacksmith. As I never saw my father or my mother, and never saw any
likeness of either of them (for their days were long before the days of
photographs*), my first fancies regarding what they were like, were
unreasonably derived from their tombstones. The shape of the letters on my father’s, gave me an odd idea that he was a square, stout,
dark man, with curly black hair. From the character and turn of the
inscription, “Also Georgiana Wife of the Above,” I drew a childish
conclusion that my mother was freckled and sickly. To five little
stone lozenges,* each about a foot and a half long, which were
arranged in a neat row beside their grave, and were sacred to the
memory of five little brothers of mine––who gave up trying to get a
living, exceedingly early in that universal struggle*––I am indebted
for a belief I religiously entertained that they had all been born on
their backs with their hands in their trousers-pockets, and had never
taken them out in this state of existence.
Ours was the marsh country, down by the river,* within, as the
river wound, twenty miles of the sea. My first most vivid and broad
impression of the identity of things, seems to me to have been gained
on a memorable raw afternoon towards evening. At such a time I
found out for certain, that this bleak place overgrown with nettles
was the churchyard; and that Philip Pirrip, late of this parish, and
also Georgiana wife of the above, were dead and buried; and that
Alexander, Bartholomew, Abraham, Tobias, and Roger, infant children of the aforesaid, were also dead and buried; and that the dark
flat wilderness beyond the churchyard, intersected with dykes and
mounds and gates, with scattered cattle feeding on it, was the
marshes; and that the low leaden line beyond, was the river; and that
the distant savage lair from which the wind was rushing, was the sea;
and that the small bundle of shivers growing afraid of it all and
beginning to cry, was Pip.
“Hold your noise!” cried a terrible voice, as a man started up from
among the graves at the side of the church porch. “Keep still, you
little devil, or I’ll cut your throat!”
A fearful man, all in coarse grey, with a great iron on his leg. A
man with no hat, and with broken shoes, and with an old rag tied
round his head. A man who had been soaked in water, and
smothered in mud, and lamed by stones, and cut by flints, and stung
by nettles, and torn by briars; who limped, and shivered, and glared
and growled; and whose teeth chattered in his head as he seized me
by the chin.
“O! Don’t cut my throat, sir,” I pleaded in terror. “Pray don’t do
it, sir.”
“Tell us your name!” said the man. “Quick!”
“Pip, sir.”
“Once more,” said the man, staring at me. “Give it mouth!”
“Pip. Pip, sir!”
“Show us where you live,” said the man. “Pint out the place!”
I pointed to where our village lay, on the flat in-shore among the
alder-trees and pollards, a mile or more from the church.
The man, after looking at me for a moment, turned me upsidedown and emptied my pockets. There was nothing in them but a
piece of bread. When the church came to itself––for he was so sudden and strong that he made it go head over heels before me, and I
saw the steeple under my feet––when the church came to itself, I say,
I was seated on a high tombstone, trembling, while he ate the bread
ravenously.
“You young dog,” said the man, licking his lips, “what fat cheeks
you ha’ got.”
I believe they were fat, though I was at that time undersized for
my years, and not strong.
“Darn Me if I couldn’t eat ’em,”* said the man, with a threatening
shake of his head, “and if I han’t half a mind to’t!”
I earnestly expressed my hope that he wouldn’t, and held tighter
to the tombstone on which he had put me; partly, to keep myself
upon it; partly, to keep myself from crying.
4 Great Expectations
“Now then, lookee here!” said the man. “Where’s your mother?”
“There, sir!” said I.
He started, made a short run, and stopped and looked over his
shoulder.
“There, sir!” I timidly explained. “Also Georgiana. That’s my
mother.”
“Oh!” said he, coming back. “And is that your father alonger your
mother?”
“Yes, sir,” said I; “him too; late of this parish.”
“Ha!” he muttered then, considering. “Who d’ye live with––
supposin’ you’re kindly let to live, which I han’t made up my mind
about?”
“My sister, sir––Mrs. Joe Gargery––wife of Joe Gargery, the
blacksmith, sir.”
“Blacksmith, eh?” said he. And looked down at his leg.
After darkly looking at his leg and at me several times, he came
closer to my tombstone, took me by both arms, and tilted me back as
far as he could hold me; so that his eyes looked most powerfully
down into mine, and mine looked most helplessly up into his.
“Now lookee here,” he said, “the question being whether you’re to
be let to live. You know what a file is.”
“Yes, sir.”
“And you know what wittles* is.”
“Yes sir.”
After each question he tilted me over a little more, so as to give me
a greater sense of helplessness and danger.
“You get me a file.” He tilted me again. “And you get me wittles.”
He tilted me again. “You bring ’em both to me.” He tilted me again.
“Or I’ll have your heart and liver out.” He tilted me again.
I was dreadfully frightened, and so giddy that I clung to him with
both hands, and said, “If you would kindly please to let me keep
upright, sir, perhaps I shouldn’t be sick, and perhaps I could attend
more.”
He gave me a most tremendous dip and roll, so that the church
jumped over its own weather-cock. Then, he held me by the arms, in
an upright position on the top of the stone, and went on in these
fearful terms:
“You bring me, to-morrow morning early, that file and them wittles. You bring the lot to me, at that old Battery over yonder. You do
i] Volume I Chapter I 5
it, and you never dare to say a word or dare to make a sign concerning your having seen such a person as me, or any person sumever,
and you shall be let to live. You fail, or you go from my words in any
partickler, no matter how small it is, and your heart and your liver
shall be tore out, roasted and ate. Now, I ain’t alone, as you may think
I am. There’s a young man hid with me, in comparison with which
young man I am a Angel. That young man hears the words I speak.
That young man has a secret way pecooliar to himself, of getting at a
boy, and at his heart, and at his liver. It is in wain for a boy to attempt
to hide himself from that young man. A boy may lock his door, may
be warm in bed, may tuck himself up, may draw the clothes over his
head, may think himself comfortable and safe, but that young man
will softly creep and creep his way to him and tear him open. I am a
keeping that young man from harming of you at the present
moment, with great difficulty. I find it wery hard to hold that young
man off of your inside. Now, what do you say?”
I said that I would get him the file, and I would get him what
broken bits of food I could, and I would come to him at the Battery
early in the morning.
“Say Lord strike you dead if you don’t!” said the man.
I said so, and he took me down.
“Now,” he pursued, “you remember what you’ve undertook, and
you remember that young man, and you get home!”
“Goo-good night, sir,” I faltered.
“Much of that!” said he, glancing about him over the cold wet flat.
“I wish I was a frog. Or a eel!”
At the same time, he hugged his shuddering body in both his
arms––clasping himself, as if to hold himself together––and limped
towards the low church wall. As I saw him go, picking his way among
the nettles, and among the brambles that bound the green mounds,
he looked in my young eyes as if he were eluding the hands of the
dead people, stretching up cautiously out of their graves, to get a
twist upon his ankle and pull him in.
When he came to the low church wall, he got over it, like a man
whose legs were numbed and stiff, and then turned round to look for
me. When I saw him turning, I set my face towards home, and made
the best use of my legs. But presently I looked over my shoulder, and
saw him going on again towards the river, still hugging himself in
both arms, and picking his way with his sore feet among the great
6 Great Expectations
stones dropped into the marshes here and there, for stepping-places
when the rains were heavy, or the tide was in.
The marshes were just a long black horizontal line then, as I
stopped to look after him; and the river was just another horizontal
line, not nearly so broad nor yet so black; and the sky was just a row
of long angry red lines and dense black lines intermixed. On the
edge of the river I could faintly make out the only two black things in
all the prospect that seemed to be standing upright; one of these was
the beacon by which the sailors steered––like an unhooped cask
upon a pole––an ugly thing when you were near it; the other, a
gibbet* with some chains hanging to it which had once held a pirate.
The man was limping on towards this latter, as if he were the pirate
come to life, and come down, and going back to hook himself up
again. It gave me a terrible turn when I thought so; and as I saw the
cattle lifting their heads to gaze after him, I wondered whether they
thought so too. I looked all round for the horrible young man, and
could see no signs of him. But, now I was frightened again, and ran
home without stopping.
CHAPTER II
My sister, Mrs. Joe Gargery, was more than twenty years older
than I, and had established a great reputation with herself and the
neighbours because she had brought me up “by hand.”* Having at
that time to find out for myself what the expression meant, and
knowing her to have a hard and heavy hand, and to be much in the
habit of laying it upon her husband as well as upon me, I supposed
that Joe Gargery and I were both brought up by hand.
She was not a good-looking woman, my sister; and I had a general
impression that she must have made Joe Gargery marry her by hand.
Joe was a fair man, with curls of flaxen hair on each side of his
smooth face, and with eyes of such a very undecided blue that they
seemed to have somehow got mixed with their own whites. He was a
mild, good-natured, sweet-tempered, easy-going, foolish, dear
fellow––a sort of Hercules in strength, and also in weakness.
My sister, Mrs. Joe, with black hair and eyes, had such a prevailing
redness of skin that I sometimes used to wonder whether it was
possible she washed herself with a nutmeg-grater instead of soap.
ii] Volume I Chapter II 7
She was tall and bony, and almost always wore a coarse apron, fastened over her figure behind with two loops, and having a square
impregnable bib in front, that was stuck full of pins and needles. She
made it a powerful merit in herself, and a strong reproach against
Joe, that she wore this apron so much. Though I really see no reason
why she should have worn it at all: or why, if she did wear it at all,
she should not have taken it off, every day of her life.
Joe’s forge adjoined our house, which was a wooden house, as
many of the dwellings in our country were––most of them, at that
time. When I ran home from the churchyard, the forge was shut up,
and Joe was sitting alone in the kitchen. Joe and I being fellowsufferers, and having confidences as such, Joe imparted a confidence
to me, the moment I raised the latch of the door and peeped in at
him opposite to it, sitting in the chimney corner.
“Mrs. Joe has been out a dozen times, looking for you, Pip. And
she’s out now, making it a baker’s dozen.”
“Is she?”
“Yes, Pip,” said Joe; “and what’s worse, she’s got Tickler with
her.”
At this dismal intelligence, I twisted the only button on my waistcoat round and round, and looked in great depression at the fire.
Tickler was a wax-ended piece of cane, worn smooth by collision
with my tickled frame.
“She sot down,” said Joe, “and she got up, and she made a grab at
Tickler, and she Ram-paged out. That’s what she did,” said Joe,
slowly clearing the fire between the lower bars with the poker, and
looking at it: “she Ram-paged out, Pip.”
“Has she been gone long, Joe?” I always treated him as a larger
species of child, and as no more than my equal.
“Well,” said Joe, glancing up at the Dutch clock,* “she’s been on
the Ram-page, this last spell, about five minutes, Pip. She’s a coming! Get behind the door, old chap, and have the jack-towel* betwixt
you.”
I took the advice. My sister, Mrs. Joe, throwing the door wide
open, and finding an obstruction behind it, immediately divined the
cause, and applied Tickler to its further investigation. She concluded by throwing me––I often served her as a connubial missile––
at Joe, who, glad to get hold of me on any terms, passed me on into
the chimney and quietly fenced me up there with his great leg.
8 Great Expectations
“Where have you been, you young monkey?” said Mrs. Joe,
stamping her foot. “Tell me directly what you’ve been doing to wear
me away with fret and fright and worrit, or I’d have you out of that
corner if you was fifty Pips, and he was five hundred Gargerys.”
“I have only been to the churchyard,” said I, from my stool, crying
and rubbing myself.
“Churchyard!” repeated my sister. “If it warn’t for me you’d have
been to the churchyard long ago, and stayed there. Who brought you
up by hand?”
“You did,” said I.
“And why did I do it, I should like to know!” exclaimed my sister.
I whimpered, “I don’t know.”
“I don’t!” said my sister. “I’d never do it again! I know that. I may
truly say I’ve never had this apron of mine off, since born you were.
It’s bad enough to be a blacksmith’s wife (and him a Gargery) without being your mother.”
My thoughts strayed from that question as I looked disconsolately
at the fire. For, the fugitive out on the marshes with the ironed leg,
the mysterious young man, the file, the food, and the dreadful pledge
I was under to commit a larceny on those sheltering premises, rose
before me in the avenging coals.
“Hah!” said Mrs. Joe, restoring Tickler to his station. “Churchyard, indeed! You may well say churchyard, you two.” One of us, bythe-by, had not said it at all. “You’ll drive me to the churchyard
betwixt you, one of these days, and oh, a pr-r-recious pair you’d be
without me!”
As she applied herself to set the tea-things, Joe peeped down at me
over his leg, as if he were mentally casting me and himself up, and
calculating what kind of pair we practically should make, under the
grievous circumstances foreshadowed. After that, he sat feeling his
right-side flaxen curls and whisker, and following Mrs. Joe about
with his blue eyes, as his manner always was at squally times.
My sister had a trenchant way of cutting our bread-and-butter for
us, that never varied. First, with her left hand she jammed the loaf
hard and fast against her bib––where it sometimes got a pin into it,
and sometimes a needle, which we afterwards got into our mouths.
Then she took some butter (not too much) on a knife and spread it
on the loaf, in an apothecary kind of way as if she were making a
plaister*––using both sides of the knife with a slapping dexterity,
ii] Volume I Chapter II 9
and trimming and moulding the butter off round the crust. Then,
she gave the knife a final smart wipe on the edge of the plaister, and
then sawed a very thick round off the loaf: which she finally, before
separating from the loaf, hewed into two halves, of which Joe got
one, and I the other.
On the present occasion, though I was hungry, I dared not eat my
slice. I felt that I must have something in reserve for my dreadful
acquaintance, and his ally the still more dreadful young man. I knew
Mrs. Joe’s housekeeping to be of the strictest kind, and that my
larcenous researches might find nothing available in the safe. Therefore I resolved to put my hunk of bread-and-butter down the leg of
my trousers.
The effort of resolution necessary to the achievement of this purpose, I found to be quite awful. It was as if I had to make up my mind
to leap from the top of a high house, or plunge into a great depth of
water. And it was made the more difficult by the unconscious Joe. In
our already-mentioned freemasonry as fellow-sufferers, and in his
good-natured companionship with me, it was our evening habit to
compare the way we bit through our slices, by silently holding them
up to each other’s admiration now and then––which stimulated us to
new exertions. To-night, Joe several times invited me, by the display
of his fast-diminishing slice, to enter upon our usual friendly competition; but he found me, each time, with my yellow mug of tea on
one knee, and my untouched bread-and-butter on the other. At last,
I desperately considered that the thing I contemplated must be
done, and that it had best be done in the least improbable manner
consistent with the circumstances. I took advantage of a moment
when Joe had just looked at me, and got my bread-and-butter down
my leg.
Joe was evidently made uncomfortable by what he supposed to be
my loss of appetite, and took a thoughtful bite out of his slice, which
he didn’t seem to enjoy. He turned it about in his mouth much
longer than usual, pondering over it a good deal, and after all gulped
it down like a pill. He was about to take another bite, and had just got
his head on one side for a good purchase on it, when his eye fell on
me, and he saw that my bread-and-butter was gone.
The wonder and consternation with which Joe stopped on the
threshold of his bite and stared at me, were too evident to escape my
sister’s observation.
10 Great Expectations
“What’s the matter now?” said she, smartly, as she put down her
cup.
“I say, you know!” muttered Joe, shaking his head at me in a very
serious remonstrance. “Pip, old chap! You’ll do yourself a mischief.
It’ll stick somewhere. You can’t have chawed it, Pip.”
“What’s the matter now? ” repeated my sister, more sharply than
before.
“If you can cough any trifle on it up, Pip, I’d recommend you to do
it,” said Joe, all aghast. “Manners is manners, but still your elth’s
your elth.”
By this time, my sister was quite desperate, so she pounced on Joe,
and, taking him by the two whiskers, knocked his head for a little
while against the wall behind him: while I sat in the corner, looking
guiltily on.
“Now, perhaps you’ll mention what’s the matter,” said my sister,
out of breath, “you staring great stuck pig.”
Joe looked at her in a helpless way; then took a helpless bite, and
looked at me again.
“You know, Pip,” said Joe, solemnly, with his last bite in his cheek,
and speaking in a confidential voice, as if we two were quite alone,
“you and me is always friends, and I’d be the last to tell upon you,
any time. But such a”––he moved his chair and looked about the
floor between us, and then again at me––“such a most oncommon
Bolt as that!”
“Been bolting his food, has he?” cried my sister.
“You know, old chap,” said Joe, looking at me, and not at Mrs. Joe
with his bite still in his cheek, “I Bolted, myself, when I was your
age––frequent––and as a boy I’ve been among a many Bolters; but I
never see your Bolting equal yet, Pip, and it’s a mercy you ain’t
Bolted dead.”
My sister made a dive at me, and fished me up by the hair: saying
nothing more than the awful words, “You come along and be dosed.”
Some medical beast had revived Tar-water* in those days as a fine
medicine, and Mrs. Joe always kept a supply of it in the cupboard;
having a belief in its virtues correspondent to its nastiness. At the
best of times, so much of this elixir was administered to me as a
choice restorative, that I was conscious of going about, smelling like
a new fence. On this particular evening the urgency of my case
demanded a pint of this mixture, which was poured down my throat,
ii] Volume I Chapter II 11
for my greater comfort, while Mrs. Joe held my head under her arm,
as a boot would be held in a boot-jack.* Joe got off with half a pint;
but was made to swallow that (much to his disturbance, as he sat
slowly munching and meditating before the fire), “because he had
had a turn.” Judging from myself, I should say he certainly had a
turn afterwards, if he had had none before.
Conscience is a dreadful thing when it accuses man or boy; but
when, in the case of a boy, that secret burden co-operates with
another secret burden down the leg of his trousers, it is (as I can
testify) a great punishment. The guilty knowledge that I was going
to rob Mrs. Joe––I never thought I was going to rob Joe, for I never
thought of any of the housekeeping property as his––united to the
necessity of always keeping one hand on my bread-and-butter as I
sat, or when I was ordered about the kitchen on any small errand,
almost drove me out of my mind. Then, as the marsh winds made
the fire glow and flare, I thought I heard the voice outside, of the man
with the iron on his leg who had sworn me to secrecy, declaring that
he couldn’t and wouldn’t starve until to-morrow but must be fed
now. At other times, I thought, What if the young man who was with
so much difficulty restrained from imbruing his hands in me, should
yield to a constitutional impatience, or should mistake the time, and
should think himself accredited to my heart and liver to-night,
instead of to-morrow! If ever anybody’s hair stood on end with terror,
mine must have done so then. But, perhaps, nobody’s ever did?
It was Christmas Eve, and I had to stir the pudding for the next
day, with a copper-stick* from seven to eight by the Dutch clock. I
tried it with the load upon my leg (and that made me think afresh of
the man with the load on his leg), and found the tendency of exercise
to bring the bread-and-butter out of my ankle, quite unmanageable.
Happily, I slipped away, and deposited that part of my conscience in
my garret bedroom.
“Hark!” said I, when I had done my stirring, and was taking a final
warm in the chimney corner before being sent up to bed; “was that
great guns, Joe?”
“Ah!” said Joe. “There’s another conwict off.*”
“What does that mean, Joe?” said I.
Mrs. Joe, who always took explanations upon herself, said, snappishly, “Escaped. Escaped.” Administering the definition like Tarwater.
12 Great Expectations
While Mrs. Joe sat with her head bending over her needlework, I
put my mouth into the forms of saying to Joe, “What’s a convict?”
Joe put his mouth into the forms of returning such a highly elaborate
answer, that I could make out nothing of it but the single word “Pip.”
“There was a conwict off last night,” said Joe, aloud, “after
sunset-gun.* And they fired warning of him. And now, it appears
they’re firing warning of another.”
“Who’s firing?” said I.
“Drat that boy,” interposed my sister, frowning at me over her
work, “what a questioner he is. Ask no questions, and you’ll be told
no lies.”
It was not very polite to herself, I thought, to imply that I should
be told lies by her, even if I did ask questions. But she never was
polite, unless there was company.
At this point, Joe greatly augmented my curiosity by taking the
utmost pains to open his mouth very wide, and to put it into the
form of a word that looked to me like “sulks.” Therefore, I naturally
pointed to Mrs. Joe, and put my mouth into the form of saying,
“her?” But Joe wouldn’t hear of that, at all, and again opened his
mouth very wide, and shook the form of a most emphatic word out
of it. But I could make nothing of the word.
“Mrs. Joe,” said I, as a last resource, “I should like to know––if
you wouldn’t much mind––where the firing comes from?”
“Lord bless the boy!” exclaimed my sister, as if she didn’t quite
mean that, but rather the contrary. “From the Hulks.*”
“Oh-h!” said I, looking at Joe. “Hulks!”
Joe gave a reproachful cough, as much as to say, “Well, I told you
so.”
“And please what’s Hulks?” said I.
“That’s the way with this boy!” exclaimed my sister, pointing me
out with her needle and thread, and shaking her head at me. “Answer
him one question, and he’ll ask you a dozen directly. Hulks are
prison-ships, right ’cross th’ meshes.” We always used that name for
marshes, in our country.
“I wonder who’s put into prison-ships, and why they’re put
there?” said I, in a general way, and with quiet desperation.
It was too much for Mrs. Joe, who immediately rose. “I tell you
what, young fellow,” said she, “I didn’t bring you up by hand to
badger people’s lives out. It would be blame to me, and not praise, if
ii] Volume I Chapter II 13
I had. People are put in the Hulks because they murder, and because
they rob, and forge, and do all sorts of bad; and they always begin by
asking questions. Now, you get along to bed!”
I was never allowed a candle to light me to bed, and, as I went upstairs in the dark, with my head tingling––from Mrs. Joe’s thimble
having played the tambourine upon it, to accompany her last
words––I felt fearfully sensible of the great convenience that the
Hulks were handy for me. I was clearly on my way there. I had begun
by asking questions, and I was going to rob Mrs. Joe.
Since that time, which is far enough away now, I have often
thought that few people know what secrecy there is in the young,
under terror. No matter how unreasonable the terror, so that it be
terror. I was in mortal terror of the young man who wanted my heart
and liver; I was in mortal terror of my interlocutor with the ironed
leg; I was in mortal terror of myself, from whom an awful promise
had been extracted; I had no hope of deliverance through my allpowerful sister, who repulsed me at every turn; I am afraid to think
of what I might have done, on requirement, in the secrecy of my
terror.
If I slept at all that night, it was only to imagine myself drifting
down the river on a strong spring tide, to the Hulks; a ghostly pirate
calling out to me through a speaking-trumpet, as I passed the gibbetstation, that I had better come ashore and be hanged there at once,
and not put it off. I was afraid to sleep, even if I had been inclined,
for I knew that at the first faint dawn of morning I must rob the
pantry. There was no doing it in the night, for there was no getting a
light by easy friction* then; to have got one, I must have struck it out
of flint and steel, and have made a noise like the very pirate himself
rattling his chains.
As soon as the great black velvet pall outside my little window was
shot with grey, I got up and went down stairs; every board upon the
way, and every crack in every board, calling after me, “Stop thief !”
and “Get up, Mrs. Joe!” In the pantry, which was far more abundantly supplied than usual, owing to the season, I was very much
alarmed, by a hare hanging up by the heels, whom I rather thought I
caught, when my back was half turned, winking. I had no time for
verification, no time for selection, no time for anything, for I had no
time to spare. I stole some bread, some rind of cheese, about half a
jar of mincemeat (which I tied up in my pocket-handkerchief with
14 Great Expectations
my last night’s slice), some brandy from a stone bottle (which I
decanted into a glass bottle I had secretly used for making that
intoxicating fluid, Spanish-liquorice-water,* up in my room: diluting the stone bottle from a jug in the kitchen cupboard), a meat bone
with very little on it, and a beautiful round compact pork pie. I was
nearly going away without the pie, but I was tempted to mount upon
a shelf, to look what it was that was put away so carefully in a covered
earthenware dish in a corner, and I found it was the pie, and I took it,
in the hope that it was not intended for early use, and would not be
missed for some time.
There was a door in the kitchen, communicating with the forge; I
unlocked and unbolted that door, and got a file from among Joe’s
tools. Then, I put the fastenings as I had found them, opened the
door at which I had entered when I ran home last night, shut it, and
ran for the misty marshes.
CHAPTER III
It was a rimy morning, and very damp. I had seen the damp lying
on the outside of my little window, as if some goblin had been crying
there all night, and using the window for a pocket-handkerchief.
Now, I saw the damp lying on the bare hedges and spare grass, like a
coarser sort of spiders’ webs; hanging itself from twig to twig and
blade to blade. On every rail and gate, wet lay clammy; and the
marsh-mist was so thick, that the wooden finger on the post directing people to our village––a direction which they never accepted, for
they never came there––was invisible to me until I was quite close
under it. Then, as I looked up at it, while it dripped, it seemed to my
oppressed conscience like a phantom devoting me to the Hulks.
The mist was heavier yet when I got out upon the marshes, so that
instead of my running at everything, everything seemed to run at
me. This was very disagreeable to a guilty mind. The gates and
dykes and banks came bursting at me through the mist, as if they
cried as plainly as could be, “A boy with Somebody-else’s pork pie!
Stop him!” The cattle came upon me with like suddenness, staring
out of their eyes, and steaming out of their nostrils, “Holloa, young
thief !” One black ox, with a white cravat on––who even had to my
awakened conscience something of a clerical air––fixed me so
iii] Volume I Chapter III 15
obstinately with his eyes, and moved his blunt head round in such
an accusatory manner as I moved round, that I blubbered out to him,
“I couldn’t help it, sir! It wasn’t for myself I took it!” Upon which
he put down his head, blew a cloud of smoke out of his nose, and
vanished with a kick-up of his hind-legs and a flourish of his tail.
All this time, I was getting on towards the river; but however fast I
went, I couldn’t warm my feet, to which the damp cold seemed
riveted, as the iron was riveted to the leg of the man I was running to
meet. I knew my way to the Battery, pretty straight, for I had been
down there on a Sunday with Joe, and Joe, sitting on an old gun, had
told me that when I was ’prentice to him regularly bound, we would
have such Larks there! However, in the confusion of the mist, I
found myself at last too far to the right, and consequently had to try
back along the river-side, on the bank of loose stones above the mud
and the stakes that staked the tide out. Making my way along here
with all despatch, I had just crossed a ditch which I knew to be very
near the Battery, and had just scrambled up the mound beyond the
ditch, when I saw the man sitting before me. His back was towards
me, and he had his arms folded, and was nodding forward, heavy
with sleep.
I thought he would be more glad if I came upon him with his
breakfast, in that unexpected manner, so I went forward softly and
touched him on the shoulder. He instantly jumped up, and it was not
the same man, but another man!
And yet this man was dressed in coarse grey, too, and had a great
iron on his leg, and was lame, and hoarse, and cold, and was everything that the other man was; except that he had not the same face,
and had a flat broad-brimmed low-crowned felt hat on. All this, I saw
in a moment, for I had only a moment to see it in: he swore an oath at
me, made a hit at me––it was a round weak blow that missed me and
almost knocked himself down, for it made him stumble––and then
he ran into the mist, stumbling twice as he went, and I lost him.
“It’s the young man!” I thought, feeling my heart shoot as I identified him. I dare say I should have felt a pain in my liver, too, if I had
known where it was.
I was soon at the Battery, after that, and there was the right man––
hugging himself and limping to and fro, as if he had never all night
left off hugging and limping––waiting for me. He was awfully cold to
be sure. I half expected to see him drop down before my face and die
16 Great Expectations
of deadly cold. His eyes looked so awfully hungry, too, that when I
handed him the file and he laid it down on the grass, it occurred to
me he would have tried to eat it, if he had not seen my bundle. He
did not turn me upside down, this time, to get what I had, but left
me right side upwards while I opened the bundle and emptied my
pockets.
“What’s in the bottle, boy?” said he.
“Brandy,” said I.
He was already handing mincemeat down his throat in the most
curious manner––more like a man who was putting it away somewhere in a violent hurry, than a man who was eating it––but he left
off to take some of the liquor. He shivered all the while, so violently,
that it was quite as much as he could do to keep the neck of the bottle
between his teeth, without biting it off.
“I think you have got the ague,”* said I.
“I’m much of your opinion, boy,” said he.
“It’s bad about here,” I told him. “You’ve been lying out in the
meshes, and they’re dreadful aguish. Rheumatic, too.”
“I’ll eat my breakfast afore they’re the death of me,” said he. “I’d
do that, if I was going to be strung up to that there gallows as there is
over there, directly arterwards. I’ll beat the shivers so far, I ’ll bet
you.”
He was gobbling mincemeat, meat-bone, bread, cheese, and pork
pie, all at once: staring distrustfully while he did so at the mist all
round us, and often stopping––even stopping his jaws––to listen.
Some real or fancied sound, some clink upon the river or breathing
of beast upon the marsh, now gave him a start, and he said,
suddenly:
“You’re not a deceiving imp? You brought no one with you?”
“No, sir! No!”
“Nor giv’ no one the office* to follow you?”
“No!”
“Well,” said he, “I believe you. You’d be but a fierce young hound
indeed, if at your time of life you could help to hunt a wretched
warmint, hunted as near death and dunghill* as this poor wretched
warmint is!”
Something clicked in his throat, as if he had works in him like a
clock, and was going to strike. And he smeared his ragged rough
sleeve over his eyes.
iii] Volume I Chapter III 17
Pitying his desolation, and watching him as he gradually settled
down upon the pie, I made bold to say, “I am glad you enjoy it.”
“Did you speak?”
“I said I was glad you enjoyed it.”
“Thankee, my boy. I do.”
I had often watched a large dog of ours eating his food; and I now
noticed a decided similarity between the dog’s way of eating, and the
man’s. The man took strong sharp sudden bites, just like the dog. He
swallowed, or rather snapped up, every mouthful, too soon and too
fast; and he looked sideways here and there while he ate, as if he
thought there was danger in every direction, of somebody’s coming
to take the pie away. He was altogether too unsettled in his mind over
it, to appreciate it comfortably, I thought, or to have anybody to dine
with him, without making a chop with his jaws at the visitor. In all of
which particulars he was very like the dog.
“I am afraid you won’t leave any of it for him,” said I, timidly;
after a silence during which I had hesitated as to the politeness of
making the remark. “There’s no more to be got where that came
from.” It was the certainty of this fact that impelled me to offer the
hint.
“Leave any for him? Who’s him?” said my friend, stopping in his
crunching of pie-crust.
“The young man. That you spoke of. That was hid with you.”
“Oh ah!” he returned, with something like a gruff laugh. “Him?
Yes, yes! He don’t want no wittles.”
“I thought he looked as if he did,” said I.
The man stopped eating, and regarded me with the keenest scrutiny and the greatest surprise.
“Looked? When?”
“Just now.”
“Where?”
“Yonder,” said I, pointing; “over there, where I found him nodding asleep, and thought it was you.”
He held me by the collar and stared at me so, that I began to think
his first idea about cutting my throat had revived.
“Dressed like you, you know, only with a hat,” I explained, trembling; “and––and”––I was very anxious to put this delicately––“and
with––the same reason for wanting to borrow a file. Didn’t you hear
the cannon last night?”
18 Great Expectations
“Then, there was firing!” he said to himself.
“I wonder you shouldn’t have been sure of that,” I returned, “for
we heard it up at home, and that’s further away, and we were shut in
besides.”
“Why, see now!” said he. “When a man’s alone on these flats, with
a light head and a light stomach, perishing of cold and want, he hears
nothin’ all night, but guns firing, and voices calling. Hears? He sees
the soldiers, with their red coats lighted up by the torches carried
afore, closing in round him. Hears his number called, hears himself
challenged, hears the rattle of the muskets, hears the orders ‘Make
ready! Present! Cover him steady, men!’ and is laid hands on––and
there’s nothin’! Why, if I see one pursuing party last night––coming
up in order, Damn ’em, with their tramp, tramp––I see a hundred.
And as to firing! Why, I see the mist shake with the cannon, arter it
was broad day.––But this man;” he had said all the rest, as if he had
forgotten my being there; “did you notice anything in him?”
“He had a badly bruised face,” said I, recalling what I hardly knew
I knew.
“Not here?” exclaimed the man, striking his left cheek mercilessly,
with the flat of his hand.
“Yes, there!”
“Where is he?” He crammed what little food was left, into the
breast of his grey jacket. “Show me the way he went. I’ll pull him
down, like a bloodhound. Curse this iron on my sore leg! Give us
hold of the file, boy.”
I indicated in what direction the mist had shrouded the other
man, and he looked up at it for an instant. But he was down on the
rank wet grass, filing at his iron like a madman, and not minding me
or minding his own leg, which had an old chafe upon it and was
bloody, but which he handled as roughly as if it had no more feeling
in it than the file. I was very much afraid of him again, now that he
had worked himself into this fierce hurry, and I was likewise very
much afraid of keeping away from home any longer. I told him I
must go, but he took no notice, so I thought the best thing I could do
was to slip off. The last I saw of him, his head was bent over his knee
and he was working hard at his fetter, muttering impatient imprecations at it and at his leg. The last I heard of him, I stopped in the
mist to listen, and the file was still going.
iii] Volume I Chapter III 19
CHAPTER IV
I fully expected to find a Constable* in the kitchen, waiting to take
me up. But not only was there no Constable there, but no discovery
had yet been made of the robbery. Mrs. Joe was prodigiously busy in
getting the house ready for the festivities of the day, and Joe had been
put upon the kitchen door-step to keep him out of the dustpan––an
article into which his destiny always led him sooner or later, when
my sister was vigorously reaping the floors of her establishment.
“And where the deuce ha’ you been?” was Mrs. Joe’s Christmas
salutation, when I and my conscience showed ourselves.
I said I had been down to hear the Carols. “Ah! well!” observed
Mrs. Joe. “You might ha’ done worse.” Not a doubt of that, I
thought.
“Perhaps if I warn’t a blacksmith’s wife, and (what’s the same
thing) a slave with her apron never off, I should have been to hear the
Carols,” said Mrs. Joe. “I’m rather partial to Carols, myself, and
that’s the best of reasons for my never hearing any.”
Joe, who had ventured into the kitchen after me as the dustpan
had retired before us, drew the back of his hand across his nose with
a conciliatory air when Mrs. Joe darted a look at him, and, when her
eyes were withdrawn, secretly crossed his two forefingers, and exhibited them to me, as our token that Mrs. Joe was in a cross temper.
This was so much her normal state, that Joe and I would often, for
weeks together, be, as to our fingers, like monumental Crusaders as
to their legs.*
We were to have a superb dinner, consisting of a leg of pickled
pork and greens, and a pair of roast stuffed fowls. A handsome
mince-pie had been made yesterday morning (which accounted for
the mincemeat not being missed), and the pudding was already on
the boil. These extensive arrangements occasioned us to be cut off
unceremoniously in respect of breakfast; “for I an’t,” said Mrs. Joe,
“I an’t a going to have no formal cramming and busting and washing
up now, with what I’ve got before me, I promise you!”
So, we had our slices served out, as if we were two thousand
troops on a forced march instead of a man and boy at home; and we
took gulps of milk and water, with apologetic countenances, from a
jug on the dresser. In the mean time, Mrs. Joe put clean white
20 Great Expectations
curtains up, and tacked a new flowered-flounce across the wide
chimney to replace the old one, and uncovered the little state parlour
across the passage, which was never uncovered at any other time, but
passed the rest of the year in a cool haze of silver paper, which even
extended to the four little white crockery poodles on the mantelshelf,
each with a black nose and a basket of flowers in his mouth, and each
the counterpart of the other. Mrs. Joe was a very clean housekeeper,
but had an exquisite art of making her cleanliness more uncomfortable and unacceptable than dirt itself. Cleanliness is next to
Godliness, and some people do the same by their religion.
My sister having so much to do, was going to church vicariously;
that is to say, Joe and I were going. In his working clothes, Joe was a
well-knit characteristic-looking blacksmith; in his holiday clothes, he
was more like a scarecrow in good circumstances, than anything else.
Nothing that he wore then, fitted him or seemed to belong to him;
and everything that he wore then, grazed him. On the present festive
occasion he emerged from his room, when the blithe bells were
going, the picture of misery, in a full suit of Sunday penitentials.*
As to me, I think my sister must have had some general idea that I
was a young offender whom an Accoucheur Policeman* had taken
up (on my birthday) and delivered over to her, to be dealt with
according to the outraged majesty of the law. I was always treated as
if I had insisted on being born, in opposition to the dictates of
reason, religion, and morality, and against the dissuading arguments
of my best friends. Even when I was taken to have a new suit of
clothes, the tailor had orders to make them like a kind of Reformatory, and on no account to let me have the free use of my limbs.
Joe and I going to church, therefore, must have been a moving
spectacle for compassionate minds. Yet, what I suffered outside, was
nothing to what I underwent within. The terrors that had assailed
me whenever Mrs. Joe had gone near the pantry, or out of the room,
were only to be equalled by the remorse with which my mind dwelt
on what my hands had done. Under the weight of my wicked secret,
I pondered whether the Church would be powerful enough to shield
me from the vengeance of the terrible young man, if I divulged to
that establishment. I conceived the idea that the time when the banns
were read* and when the clergyman said, “Ye are now to declare it!”
would be the time for me to rise and propose a private conference in
the vestry. I am far from being sure that I might not have astonished
iv] Volume I Chapter IV 21
our small congregation by resorting to this extreme measure, but for
its being Christmas Day and no Sunday.
Mr. Wopsle, the clerk at church, was to dine with us; and Mr.
Hubble the wheelwright and Mrs. Hubble; and Uncle Pumblechook
(Joe’s uncle, but Mrs. Joe appropriated him), who was a well-to-do
corn-chandler in the nearest town, and drove his own chaise-cart.*
The dinner hour was half-past one. When Joe and I got home, we
found the table laid, and Mrs. Joe dressed, and the dinner dressing,
and the front door unlocked (it never was, at any other time) for the
company to enter by, and everything most splendid. And still, not a
word of the robbery.
The time came, without bringing with it any relief to my feelings,
and the company came. Mr. Wopsle, united to a Roman nose and a
large shining bald forehead, had a deep voice which he was uncommonly proud of; indeed it was understood among his acquaintance
that if you could only give him his head, he would read the clergyman into fits; he himself confessed that if the Church was “thrown
open,”* meaning to competition, he would not despair of making his
mark in it. The Church not being “thrown open,” he was, as I have
said, our clerk. But he punished the Amens* tremendously; and when
he gave out the psalm––always giving the whole verse––he looked all
round the congregation first, as much as to say, “You have heard my
friend overhead;* oblige me with your opinion of this style!”
I opened the door to the company––making believe that it was a
habit of ours to open that door––and I opened it first to Mr. Wopsle,
next to Mr. and Mrs. Hubble, and last of all to Uncle Pumblechook.
N.B. I was not allowed to call him uncle, under the severest
penalties.
“Mrs. Joe,” said Uncle Pumblechook: a large hard-breathing
middle-aged slow man, with a mouth like a fish, dull staring eyes,
and sandy hair standing upright on his head, so that he looked as if
he had just been all but choked, and had that moment come to; “I
have brought you, as the compliments of the season––I have brought
you, Mum, a bottle of sherry wine––and I have brought you, Mum,
a bottle of port wine.”
Every Christmas Day he presented himself, as a profound novelty,
with exactly the same words, and carrying the two bottles like dumbbells. Every Christmas Day, Mrs. Joe replied, as she now replied,
“Oh Un––cle Pum––ble––chook! This is kind!” Every Christmas
22 Great Expectations
Day, he retorted, as he now retorted, “It’s no more than your
merits. And now are you all bobbish,* and how’s Sixpennorth of
halfpence?” meaning me.
We dined on these occasions in the kitchen, and adjourned, for the
nuts and oranges and apples, to the parlour; which was a change very
like Joe’s change from his working clothes to his Sunday dress. My
sister was uncommonly lively on the present occasion, and indeed
was generally more gracious in the society of Mrs. Hubble than in
any other company. I remember Mrs. Hubble as a little curly sharpedged person in sky-blue, who held a conventionally juvenile position, because she had married Mr. Hubble––I don’t know at what
remote period––when she was much younger than he. I remember
Mr. Hubble as a tough high-shouldered stooping old man, of a sawdusty fragrance, with his legs extraordinarily wide apart: so that in
my short days I always saw some miles of open country between
them when I met him coming up the lane.
Among this good company I should have felt myself, even if I
hadn’t robbed the pantry, in a false position. Not because I was
squeezed in at an acute angle of the tablecloth, with the table in my
chest, and the Pumblechookian elbow in my eye, nor because I was
not allowed to speak (I didn’t want to speak), nor because I was
regaled with the scaly tips of the drumsticks of the fowls, and with
those obscure corners of pork of which the pig, when living, had had
the least reason to be vain. No; I should not have minded that, if they
would only have left me alone. But they wouldn’t leave me alone.
They seemed to think the opportunity lost, if they failed to point the
conversation at me, every now and then, and stick the point into me.
I might have been an unfortunate little bull in a Spanish arena, I got
so smartingly touched up by these moral goads.
It began the moment we sat down to dinner. Mr. Wopsle said
grace with theatrical declamation––as it now appears to me, something like a religious cross of the Ghost in Hamlet with Richard the
Third*––and ended with the very proper aspiration that we might
be truly grateful. Upon which my sister fixed me with her eye, and
said, in a low reproachful voice, “Do you hear that? Be grateful.”
“Especially,” said Mr. Pumblechook, “be grateful, boy, to them
which brought you up by hand.”
Mrs. Hubble shook her head, and contemplating me with a
mournful presentiment that I should come to no good, asked, “Why
iv] Volume I Chapter IV 23
is it that the young are never grateful?” This moral mystery seemed
too much for the company until Mr. Hubble tersely solved it by
saying, “Naterally wicious.” Everybody then murmured “True!” and
looked at me in a particularly unpleasant and personal manner.
Joe’s station and influence were something feebler (if possible)
when there was company, than when there was none. But he always
aided and comforted me when he could, in some way of his own, and
he always did so at dinner-time by giving me gravy, if there were any.
There being plenty of gravy to-day, Joe spooned into my plate, at
this point, about half a pint.
A little later on in the dinner, Mr. Wopsle reviewed the sermon
with some severity, and intimated––in the usual hypothetical case of
the Church being “thrown open”––what kind of sermon he would
have given them. After favouring them with some heads of that
discourse, he remarked that he considered the subject of the day’s
homily, ill chosen; which was the less excusable, he added, when
there were so many subjects “going about.”
“True again,” said Uncle Pumblechook. “You’ve hit it, sir! Plenty
of subjects going about, for them that know how to put salt upon
their tails.* That’s what’s wanted. A man needn’t go far to find a
subject, if he’s ready with his salt-box.” Mr. Pumblechook added,
after a short interval of reflection, “Look at Pork alone. There’s a
subject! If you want a subject, look at Pork!”
“True, sir. Many a moral for the young,” returned Mr. Wopsle;
and I knew he was going to lug me in, before he said it; “might be
deduced from that text.”
(“You listen to this,” said my sister to me, in a severe parenthesis.)
Joe gave me some more gravy.
“Swine,” pursued Mr. Wopsle, in his deepest voice, and pointing
his fork at my blushes, as if he were mentioning my christian name;
“Swine were the companions of the prodigal.* The gluttony of
Swine is put before us, as an example to the young.” (I thought this
pretty well in him who had been praising up the pork for being so
plump and juicy.) “What is detestable in a pig, is more detestable in a
boy.”
“Or girl,” suggested Mr. Hubble.
“Of course, or girl, Mr. Hubble,” assented Mr. Wopsle, rather
irritably, “but there is no girl present.”
“Besides,” said Mr. Pumblechook, turning sharp on me, “think
24 Great Expectations
what you’ve got to be grateful for. If you’d been born a
Squeaker––––”
“He was, if ever a child was,” said my sister, most emphatically.
Joe gave me some more gravy.
“Well, but I mean a four-footed Squeaker,” said Mr. Pumblechook. “If you had been born such, would you have been here now?
Not you––––”
“Unless in that form,” said Mr. Wopsle, nodding towards the
dish.
“But I don’t mean in that form, sir,” returned Mr. Pumblechook,
who had an objection to being interrupted; “I mean, enjoying himself with his elders and betters, and improving himself with their
conversation, and rolling in the lap of luxury. Would he have been
doing that? No, he wouldn’t. And what would have been your destination?” turning on me again. “You would have been disposed of
for so many shillings according to the market price of the article, and
Dunstable the butcher would have come up to you as you lay in your
straw, and he would have whipped you under his left arm, and with
his right he would have tucked up his frock to get a penknife from
out of his waistcoat-pocket, and he would have shed your blood and
had your life. No bringing up by hand then. Not a bit of it!”
Joe offered me more gravy, which I was afraid to take.
“He was a world of trouble to you, ma’am,” said Mrs. Hubble,
commiserating my sister.
“Trouble?” echoed my sister; “trouble?” And then entered on a
fearful catalogue of all the illnesses I had been guilty of, and all the
acts of sleeplessness I had committed, and all the high places I had
tumbled from, and all the low places I had tumbled into, and all the
injuries I had done myself, and all the times she had wished me in
my grave, and I had contumaciously refused to go there.
I think the Romans must have aggravated one another very much,
with their noses. Perhaps, they became the restless people they were,
in consequence. Anyhow, Mr. Wopsle’s Roman nose so aggravated
me, during the recital of my misdemeanours, that I should have liked
to pull it until he howled. But, all I had endured up to this time, was
nothing in comparison with the awful feelings that took possession
of me when the pause was broken which ensued upon my sister’s
recital, and in which pause everybody had looked at me (as I felt
painfully conscious) with indignation and abhorrence.
iv] Volume I Chapter IV 25
“Yet,” said Mr. Pumblechook, leading the company gently back to
the theme from which they had strayed, “Pork––regarded as biled––
is rich, too; ain’t it?”
“Have a little brandy, uncle,” said my sister.
O Heavens, it had come at last! He would find it was weak, he
would say it was weak, and I was lost! I held tight to the leg of the
table under the cloth, with both hands, and awaited my fate.
My sister went for the stone bottle, came back with the stone
bottle, and poured his brandy out: no one else taking any. The
wretched man trifled with his glass––took it up, looked at it
through the light, put it down––prolonged my misery. All this time,
Mrs. Joe and Joe were briskly clearing the table for the pie and
pudding.
I couldn’t keep my eyes off him. Always holding tight by the leg of
the table with my hands and feet, I saw the miserable creature finger
his glass playfully, take it up, smile, throw his head back, and drink
the brandy off. Instantly afterwards, the company were seized with
unspeakable consternation, owing to his springing to his feet, turning round several times in an appalling spasmodic whooping-cough
dance, and rushing out at the door; he then became visible through
the window, violently plunging and expectorating, making the most
hideous faces, and apparently out of his mind.
I held on tight, while Mrs. Joe and Joe ran to him. I didn’t know
how I had done it, but I had no doubt I had murdered him somehow. In my dreadful situation, it was a relief when he was brought
back, and, surveying the company all round as if they had disagreed
with him, sank down into his chair with the one significant gasp,
“Tar!”
I had filled up the bottle from the tar-water jug. I knew he would
be worse by-and-by. I moved the table, like a Medium* of the present day, by the vigour of my unseen hold upon it.
“Tar!” cried my sister, in amazement. “Why, how ever could Tar
come there?”
But, Uncle Pumblechook, who was omnipotent in that kitchen,
wouldn’t hear the word, wouldn’t hear of the subject, imperiously
waved it all away with his hand, and asked for hot gin-and-water. My
sister, who had begun to be alarmingly meditative, had to employ
herself actively in getting the gin, the hot water, the sugar, and the
lemon-peel, and mixing them.* For the time at least, I was saved. I
26 Great Expectations
still held on to the leg of the table, but clutched it now with the
fervour of gratitude.
By degrees, I became calm enough to release my grasp and partake
of pudding. Mr. Pumblechook partook of pudding. All partook of
pudding. The course terminated, and Mr. Pumblechook had begun
to beam under the genial influence of gin-and-water. I began to think
I should get over the day, when my sister said to Joe, “Clean plates––
cold.”
I clutched the leg of the table again immediately, and pressed it to
my bosom as if it had been the companion of my youth and friend of
my soul. I foresaw what was coming, and I felt that this time I really
was gone.
“You must taste,” said my sister, addressing the guests with her
best grace, “you must taste, to finish with, such a delightful and
delicious present of Uncle Pumblechook’s!”
Must they! Let them not hope to taste it!
“You must know,” said my sister, rising, “it’s a pie; a savoury pork
pie.”
The company murmured their compliments. Uncle Pumblechook, sensible of having deserved well of his fellow-creatures,
said––quite vivaciously, all things considered––“Well, Mrs. Joe,
we’ll do our best endeavours; let us have a cut at this same pie.”
My sister went out to get it. I heard her steps proceed to the
pantry. I saw Mr. Pumblechook balance his knife. I saw reawakening
appetite in the Roman nostrils of Mr. Wopsle. I heard Mr. Hubble
remark that “a bit of savoury pork pie would lay atop of anything you
could mention, and do no harm,” and I heard Joe say, “You shall
have some, Pip.” I have never been absolutely certain whether I
uttered a shrill yell of terror, merely in spirit, or in the bodily hearing
of the company. I felt that I could bear no more, and that I must run
away. I released the leg of the table, and ran for my life.
But, I ran no further than the house door, for there I ran head
foremost into a party of soldiers with their muskets: one of whom
held out a pair of handcuffs to me, saying, “Here you are, look sharp,
come on!”
iv] Volume I Chapter IV 27
CHAPTER V
The apparition of a file of soldiers ringing down the butt-ends of
their loaded muskets on our door-step, caused the dinner-party to
rise from table in confusion, and caused Mrs. Joe re-entering the
kitchen empty-handed, to stop short and stare, in her wondering
lament of “Gracious goodness gracious me, what’s gone––with
the––pie!”
The sergeant and I were in the kitchen when Mrs. Joe stood
staring; at which crisis I partially recovered the use of my senses. It
was the sergeant who had spoken to me, and he was now looking
round at the company, with his handcuffs invitingly extended
towards them in his right hand, and his left on my shoulder.
“Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen,” said the sergeant, “but as I
have mentioned at the door to this smart young shaver”* (which he
hadn’t), “I am on a chase in the name of the King, and I want the
blacksmith.”
“And pray what might you want with him?” retorted my sister,
quick to resent his being wanted at all.
“Missis,” returned the gallant sergeant, “speaking for myself, I
should reply, the honour and pleasure of his fine wife’s acquaintance;
speaking for the King, I answer, a little job done.”
This was received as rather neat in the sergeant; insomuch that
Mr. Pumblechook cried audibly, “Good again!”
“You see, blacksmith,” said the sergeant, who had by this time
picked out Joe with his eye, “we have had an accident with these, and
I find the lock of one of ’em goes wrong, and the coupling don’t act
pretty. As they are wanted for immediate service, will you throw
your eye over them?”
Joe threw his eye over them, and pronounced that the job would
necessitate the lighting of his forge fire, and would take nearer two
hours than one. “Will it? Then will you set about it at once, blacksmith,” said the off-hand sergeant, “as it’s on his Majesty’s service.
And if my men can bear a hand anywhere, they’ll make themselves
useful.” With that, he called to his men, who came trooping into the
kitchen one after another, and piled their arms in a corner. And then
they stood about, as soldiers do; now, with their hands loosely
clasped before them; now, resting a knee or a shoulder; now, easing a
28 Great Expectations
belt or a pouch; now, opening the door to spit stiffly over their high
stocks,* out into the yard.
All these things I saw without then knowing that I saw them, for I
was in an agony of apprehension. But, beginning to perceive that the
handcuffs were not for me, and that the military had so far got the
better of the pie as to put it in the background, I collected a little
more of my scattered wits.
“Would you give me the Time?” said the sergeant, addressing
himself to Mr. Pumblechook, as to a man whose appreciative powers
justified the inference that he was equal to the time.
“It’s just gone half-past two.”
“That’s not so bad,” said the sergeant, reflecting; “even if I was
forced to halt here nigh two hours, that’ll do. How far might you call
yourselves from the marshes, hereabouts? Not above a mile, I
reckon?”
“Just a mile,” said Mrs. Joe.
“That’ll do. We begin to close in upon ’em about dusk. A little
before dusk, my orders are. That’ll do.”
“Convicts, sergeant?” asked Mr. Wopsle, in a matter-of-course
way.
“Ay!” returned the sergeant, “two. They’re pretty well known to
be out on the marshes still, and they won’t try to get clear of ’em
before dusk. Anybody here seen anything of any such game?”
Everybody, myself excepted, said no, with confidence. Nobody
thought of me.
“Well!” said the sergeant, “they’ll find themselves trapped in a
circle, I expect, sooner than they count on. Now, blacksmith! If
you’re ready, His Majesty the King is.”
Joe had got his coat and waistcoat and cravat off, and his leather
apron on, and passed into the forge. One of the soldiers opened its
wooden windows, another lighted the fire, another turned to at the
bellows, the rest stood round the blaze, which was soon roaring.
Then Joe began to hammer and clink, hammer and clink, and we all
looked on.
The interest of the impending pursuit not only absorbed the general attention, but even made my sister liberal. She drew a pitcher of
beer from the cask, for the soldiers, and invited the sergeant to take a
glass of brandy. But Mr. Pumblechook said, sharply, “Give him
wine, Mum. I’ll engage there’s no Tar in that:” so, the sergeant
v] Volume I Chapter V 29
thanked him and said that as he preferred his drink without tar, he
would take wine, if it was equally convenient. When it was given
him, he drank his Majesty’s health and Compliments of the Season,
and took it all at a mouthful and smacked his lips.
“Good stuff, eh, sergeant?” said Mr. Pumblechook.
“I’ll tell you something,” returned the sergeant; “I suspect that
stuff’s of your providing.”
Mr. Pumblechook, with a fat sort of laugh, said, “Ay, ay? Why?”
“Because,” returned the sergeant, clapping him on the shoulder,
“you’re a man that knows what’s what.”
D’ye think so?” said Mr. Pumblechook, with his former laugh.
“Have another glass!”
“With you. Hob and nob,”* returned the sergeant. “The top of
mine to the foot of yours––the foot of yours to the top of mine––
Ring once, ring twice––the best tune on the Musical Glasses! Your
health. May you live a thousand years, and never be a worse judge of
the right sort than you are at the present moment of your life!”
The sergeant tossed off his glass again and seemed quite ready for
another glass. I noticed that Mr. Pumblechook in his hospitality
appeared to forget that he had made a present of the wine, but took
the bottle from Mrs. Joe and had all the credit of handing it about in
a gush of joviality. Even I got some. And he was so very free of the
wine that he even called for the other bottle and handed that about
with the same liberality, when the first was gone.
As I watched them while they all stood clustering about the forge,
enjoying themselves so much, I thought what terrible good sauce for
a dinner my fugitive friend on the marshes was. They had not
enjoyed themselves a quarter so much, before the entertainment was
brightened with the excitement he furnished. And now, when they
were all in lively anticipation of “the two villains” being taken, and
when the bellows seemed to roar for the fugitives, the fire to flare for
them, the smoke to hurry away in pursuit of them, Joe to hammer
and clink for them, and all the murky shadows on the wall to shake at
them in menace as the blaze rose and sank and the red-hot sparks
dropped and died, the pale afternoon outside, almost seemed in my
pitying young fancy to have turned pale on their account, poor
wretches.
At last, Joe’s job was done, and the ringing and roaring stopped.
As Joe got on his coat, he mustered courage to propose that some of
30 Great Expectations
us should go down with the soldiers and see what came of the hunt.
Mr. Pumblechook and Mr. Hubble declined, on the plea of a pipe
and ladies’ society; but Mr. Wopsle said he would go, if Joe would.
Joe said he was agreeable, and would take me, if Mrs. Joe approved.
We never should have got leave to go, I am sure, but for Mrs. Joe’s
curiosity to know all about it and how it ended. As it was, she merely
stipulated, “If you bring the boy back with his head blown to bits by
a musket, don’t look to me to put it together again.”
The sergeant took a polite leave of the ladies, and parted from Mr.
Pumblechook as from a comrade; though I doubt if he were quite as
fully sensible of that gentleman’s merits under arid conditions, as
when something moist was going. His men resumed their muskets
and fell in. Mr. Wopsle, Joe, and I, received strict charge to keep in
the rear, and to speak no word after we reached the marshes. When
we were all out in the raw air and were steadily moving towards our
business, I treasonably whispered to Joe, “I hope, Joe, we shan’t find
them.” And Joe whispered to me, “I’d give a shilling if they had cut
and run, Pip.”
We were joined by no stragglers from the village, for the weather
was cold and threatening, the way dreary, the footing bad, darkness
coming on, and the people had good fires in-doors and were keeping
the day. A few faces hurried to glowing windows and looked after us,
but none came out. We passed the finger-post, and held straight on
to the churchyard. There, we were stopped a few minutes by a signal
from the sergeant’s hand, while two or three of his men dispersed
themselves among the graves, and also examined the porch. They
came in again without finding anything, and then we struck out on
the open marshes, through the gate at the side of the churchyard. A
bitter sleet came rattling against us here on the east wind, and Joe
took me on his back.
Now that we were out upon the dismal wilderness where they
little thought I had been within eight or nine hours and had seen
both men hiding, I considered for the first time, with great dread, if
we should come upon them, would my particular convict suppose
that it was I who had brought the soldiers there? He had asked me if
I was a deceiving imp, and he had said I should be a fierce young
hound if I joined the hunt against him. Would he believe that I was
both imp and hound in treacherous earnest, and had betrayed him?
It was of no use asking myself this question now. There I was, on
v] Volume I Chapter V 31
Joe’s back, and there was Joe beneath me, charging at the ditches like
a hunter, and stimulating Mr. Wopsle not to tumble on his Roman
nose, and to keep up with us. The soldiers were in front of us,
extended into a pretty wide line with an interval between man and
man. We were taking the course I had begun with, and from which I
had diverged in the mist. Either the mist was not out again yet, or
the wind had dispelled it. Under the low red glare of sunset, the
beacon, and the gibbet, and the mound of the Battery, and the opposite shore of the river, were plain, though all of a watery lead colour.
With my heart thumping like a blacksmith at Joe’s broad shoulder,
I looked all about for any sign of the convicts. I could see none, I
could hear none. Mr. Wopsle had greatly alarmed me more than
once, by his blowing and hard breathing; but I knew the sounds by
this time, and could dissociate them from the object of pursuit. I got
a dreadful start, when I thought I heard the file still going; but it was
only a sheep bell. The sheep stopped in their eating and looked
timidly at us; and the cattle, their heads turned from the wind and
sleet, stared angrily as if they held us responsible for both annoyances; but, except these things, and the shudder of the dying day in
every blade of grass, there was no break in the bleak stillness of the
marshes.
The soldiers were moving on in the direction of the old Battery,
and we were moving on a little way behind them, when, all of a
sudden, we all stopped. For, there had reached us on the wings of the
wind and rain,* a long shout. It was repeated. It was at a distance
towards the east, but it was long and loud. Nay, there seemed to be
two or more shouts raised together––if one might judge from a
confusion in the sound.
To this effect the sergeant and the nearest men were speaking
under their breath, when Joe and I came up. After another moment’s
listening, Joe (who was a good judge) agreed, and Mr. Wopsle (who
was a bad judge) agreed. The sergeant, a decisive man, ordered that
the sound should not be answered, but that the course should be
changed, and that his men should make towards it “at the double.”
So we slanted to the right (where the East was), and Joe pounded
away so wonderfully, that I had to hold on tight to keep my seat.
It was a run indeed now, and what Joe called, in the only two
words he spoke all the time, “a Winder.”* Down banks and up
banks, and over gates, and splashing into dykes, and breaking among
32 Great Expectations
coarse rushes: no man cared where he went. As we came nearer to
the shouting, it became more and more apparent that it was made by
more than one voice. Sometimes, it seemed to stop altogether, and
then the soldiers stopped. When it broke out again, the soldiers made
for it at a greater rate than ever, and we after them. After a while, we
had so run it down, that we could hear one voice calling “Murder!”
and another voice, “Convicts! Runaways! Guard! This way for the
runaway convicts!” Then both voices would seem to be stifled in a
struggle, and then would break out again. And when it had come to
this, the soldiers ran like deer, and Joe too.
The sergeant ran in first, when we had run the noise quite down,
and two of his men ran in close upon him. Their pieces were cocked
and levelled when we all ran in.
“Here are both men!” panted the sergeant, struggling at the bottom of a ditch. “Surrender, you two! and confound you for two wild
beasts! Come asunder!”
Water was splashing, and mud was flying, and oaths were being
sworn, and blows were being struck, when some more men went
down into the ditch to help the sergeant, and dragged out, separately,
my convict and the other one. Both were bleeding and panting and
execrating and struggling; but of course I knew them both directly.
“Mind!” said my convict, wiping blood from his face with his
ragged sleeves, and shaking torn hair from his fingers; “I took him! I
give him up to you! Mind that!”
“It’s not much to be particular about,” said the sergeant; “it’ll do
you small good, my man, being in the same plight yourself. Handcuffs there!”
“I don’t expect it to do me any good. I don’t want it to do me more
good than it does now,” said my convict, with a greedy laugh. “I took
him. He knows it. That’s enough for me.”
The other convict was livid to look at, and, in addition to the old
bruised left side of his face, seemed to be bruised and torn all over.
He could not so much as get his breath to speak, until they were both
separately handcuffed, but leaned upon a soldier to keep himself
from falling.
“Take notice, guard––he tried to murder me,” were his first
words.
“Tried to murder him?” said my convict, disdainfully. “Try, and
not do it? I took him, and giv’ him up; that’s what I done. I not only
v] Volume I Chapter V 33
prevented him getting off the marshes, but I dragged him here––
dragged him this far on his way back. He’s a gentleman, if you
please, this villain. Now, the Hulks has got its gentleman again,
through me. Murder him? Worth my while, too, to murder him,
when I could do worse and drag him back!”
The other one still gasped, “He tried––he tried––to––murder me.
Bear––bear witness.”
“Lookee here!” said my convict to the sergeant. “Single-handed I
got clear of the prison-ship; I made a dash and I done it. I could ha’
got clear of these death-cold flats likewise––look at my leg: you
won’t find much iron on it––if I hadn’t made discovery that he was
here. Let him go free? Let him profit by the means as I found out? Let
him make a tool of me afresh and again? Once more? No, no, no. If I
had died at the bottom there;” and he made an emphatic swing at the
ditch with his manacled hands; “I’d have held to him with that grip,
that you should have been safe to find him in my hold.”*
The other fugitive, who was evidently in extreme horror of his
companion, repeated, “He tried to murder me. I should have been a
dead man if you had not come up.”
“He lies!” said my convict, with fierce energy. “He’s a liar born,
and he’ll die a liar. Look at his face; ain’t it written there? Let him
turn those eyes of his on me. I defy him to do it.”
The other, with an effort at a scornful smile––which could not,
however, collect the nervous working of his mouth into any set
expression––looked at the soldiers, and looked about at the marshes
and at the sky, but certainly did not look at the speaker.
“Do you see him?” pursued my convict. “Do you see what a
villain he is? Do you see those grovelling and wandering eyes? That’s
how he looked when we were tried together. He never looked at me.”
The other, always working and working his dry lips and turning
his eyes restlessly about him far and near, did at last turn them for a
moment on the speaker, with the words, “You are not much to look
at,” and with a half-taunting glance at the bound hands. At that
point, my convict became so frantically exasperated, that he would
have rushed upon him but for the interposition of the soldiers.
“Didn’t I tell you,” said the other convict then, “that he would
murder me, if he could?” And any one could see that he shook with
fear, and that there broke out upon his lips, curious white flakes, like
thin snow.
34 Great Expectations
“Enough of this parley,”* said the sergeant. “Light those torches.”
As one of the soldiers, who carried a basket in lieu of a gun, went
down on his knee to open it, my convict looked round him for the
first time, and saw me. I had alighted from Joe’s back on the brink of
the ditch when we came up, and had not moved since. I looked at
him eagerly when he looked at me, and slightly moved my hands and
shook my head. I had been waiting for him to see me, that I might try
to assure him of my innocence. It was not at all expressed to me that
he even comprehended my intention, for he gave me a look that I did
not understand, and it all passed in a moment. But if he had looked
at me for an hour or for a day, I could not have remembered his face
ever afterwards, as having been more attentive.
The soldier with the basket soon got a light, and lighted three or
four torches, and took one himself and distributed the others. It had
been almost dark before, but now it seemed quite dark, and soon
afterwards very dark. Before we departed from that spot, four soldiers standing in a ring, fired twice into the air. Presently we saw
other torches kindled at some distance behind us, and others on the
marshes on the opposite bank of the river. “All right,” said the
sergeant. “March.”
We had not gone far when three cannon were fired ahead of us
with a sound that seemed to burst something inside my ear. “You are
expected on board,” said the sergeant to my convict; “they know you
are coming. Don’t straggle, my man. Close up here.”
The two were kept apart, and each walked surrounded by a separate guard. I had hold of Joe’s hand now, and Joe carried one of the
torches. Mr. Wopsle had been for going back, but Joe was resolved to
see it out, so we went on with the party. There was a reasonably good
path now, mostly on the edge of the river, with a divergence here and
there where a dyke came, with a miniature windmill on it and a
muddy sluice-gate. When I looked round, I could see the other lights
coming in after us. The torches we carried, dropped great blotches
of fire upon the track, and I could see those, too, lying smoking and
flaring. I could see nothing else but black darkness. Our lights
warmed the air about us with their pitchy blaze, and the two
prisoners seemed rather to like that, as they limped along in the
midst of the muskets. We could not go fast, because of their lameness; and they were so spent, that two or three times we had to halt
while they rested.
v] Volume I Chapter V 35
After an hour or so of this travelling, we came to a rough wooden
hut and a landing-place. There was a guard in the hut, and they
challenged, and the sergeant answered. Then, we went into the hut
where there was a smell of tobacco and whitewash, and a bright fire,
and a lamp, and a stand of muskets, and a drum, and a low wooden
bedstead, like an overgrown mangle without the machinery, capable
of holding about a dozen soldiers all at once. Three or four soldiers
who lay upon it in their great-coats, were not much interested in us,
but just lifted their heads and took a sleepy stare, and then lay down
again. The sergeant made some kind of report, and some entry in a
book, and then the convict whom I call the other convict was drafted
off with his guard, to go on board first.
My convict never looked at me, except that once. While we stood
in the hut, he stood before the fire looking thoughtfully at it, or
putting up his feet by turns upon the hob, and looking thoughtfully
at them as if he pitied them for their recent adventures. Suddenly, he
turned to the sergeant, and remarked:
“I wish to say something respecting this escape. It may prevent
some persons laying under suspicion alonger me.”
“You can say what you like,” returned the sergeant, standing
coolly looking at him with his arms folded, “but you have no call to
say it here. You’ll have opportunity enough to say about it, and hear
about it, before it’s done with, you know.”
“I know, but this is another pint, a separate matter. A man can’t
starve; at least I can’t. I took some wittles, up at the willage over
yonder––where the church stands a’most out on the marshes.”
“You mean stole,” said the sergeant.
“And I’ll tell you where from. From the blacksmith’s.”
“Halloa!” said the sergeant, staring at Joe.
“Halloa, Pip!” said Joe, staring at me.
“It was some broken wittles––that’s what it was––and a dram of
liquor, and a pie.”
“Have you happened to miss such an article as a pie, blacksmith?”
asked the sergeant, confidentially.
“My wife did, at the very moment when you came in. Don’t you
know, Pip?”
“So,” said my convict, turning his eyes on Joe in a moody manner,
and without the least glance at me, “so you’re the blacksmith, are
you? Then I’m sorry to say, I’ve eat your pie.”
36 Great Expectations
“God knows you’re welcome to it––so far as it was ever mine,”
returned Joe, with a saving remembrance of Mrs. Joe. “We don’t
know what you have done, but we wouldn’t have you starved to death
for it, poor miserable fellow-creatur.––Would us, Pip?”
The something that I had noticed before, clicked in the man’s
throat again, and he turned his back. The boat had returned, and his
guard were ready, so we followed him to the landing-place made of
rough stakes and stones, and saw him put into the boat, which was
rowed by a crew of convicts like himself. No one seemed surprised to
see him, or interested in seeing him, or glad to see him, or sorry to
see him, or spoke a word, except that somebody in the boat growled
as if to dogs, “Give way, you!” which was the signal for the dip of the
oars. By the light of the torches, we saw the black Hulk lying out a
little way from the mud of the shore, like a wicked Noah’s ark.
Cribbed and barred and moored by massive rusty chains, the prisonship seemed in my young eyes to be ironed like the prisoners. We saw
the boat go alongside, and we saw him taken up the side and disappear. Then, the ends of the torches were flung hissing into the water,
and went out, as if it were all over with him.
CHAPTER VI
My state of mind regarding the pilfering from which I had been so
unexpectedly exonerated, did not impel me to frank disclosure; but I
hope it had some dregs of good at the bottom of it.
I do not recal that I felt any tenderness of conscience in reference
to Mrs. Joe, when the fear of being found out was lifted off me. But I
loved Joe––perhaps for no better reason in those early days than
because the dear fellow let me love him––and, as to him, my inner
self was not so easily composed. It was much upon my mind (particularly when I first saw him looking about for his file) that I ought
to tell Joe the whole truth. Yet I did not, and for the reason that I
mistrusted that if I did, he would think me worse than I was. The
fear of losing Joe’s confidence, and of thenceforth sitting in the
chimney corner at night staring drearily at my for ever lost companion and friend, tied up my tongue. I morbidly represented to
myself that if Joe knew it, I never afterwards could see him at
the fireside feeling his fair whisker, without thinking that he was
vi] Volume I Chapter VI 37
meditating on it. That, if Joe knew it, I never afterwards could see
him glance, however casually, at yesterday’s meat or pudding when it
came on to-day’s table, without thinking that he was debating
whether I had been in the pantry. That, if Joe knew it, and at any
subsequent period of our joint domestic life remarked that his beer
was flat or thick, the conviction that he suspected Tar in it, would
bring a rush of blood to my face. In a word, I was too cowardly to do
what I knew to be right, as I had been too cowardly to avoid doing
what I knew to be wrong. I had had no intercourse with the world at
that time, and I imitated none of its many inhabitants who act in this
manner. Quite an untaught genius, I made the discovery of the line
of action for myself.
As I was sleepy before we were far away from the prison-ship, Joe
took me on his back again and carried me home. He must have had a
tiresome journey of it, for Mr. Wopsle, being knocked up, was in
such a very bad temper that if the Church had been thrown open, he
would probably have excommunicated the whole expedition, beginning with Joe and myself. In his lay capacity, he persisted in sitting
down in the damp to such an insane extent, that when his coat was
taken off to be dried at the kitchen fire, the circumstantial evidence
on his trousers would have hanged him if it had been a capital
offence.
By that time, I was staggering on the kitchen floor like a little
drunkard, through having been newly set upon my feet, and through
having been fast asleep, and through waking in the heat and lights
and noise of tongues. As I came to myself (with the aid of a heavy
thump between the shoulders, and the restorative exclamation “Yah!
Was there ever such a boy as this!” from my sister), I found Joe
telling them about the convict’s confession, and all the visitors suggesting different ways by which he had got into the pantry. Mr.
Pumblechook made out, after carefully surveying the premises, that
he had first got upon the roof of the forge, and had then got upon
the roof of the house, and had then let himself down the kitchen
chimney by a rope made of his bedding cut into strips; and as Mr.
Pumblechook was very positive and drove his own chaise-cart––
over everybody––it was agreed that it must be so. Mr. Wopsle, indeed, wildly cried out “No!” with the feeble malice of a tired man; but,
as he had no theory, and no coat on, he was unanimously set at
naught––not to mention his smoking hard behind, as he stood with
38 Great Expectations
his back to the kitchen fire to draw the damp out: which was not
calculated to inspire confidence.
This was all I heard that night before my sister clutched me, as a
slumberous offence to the company’s eyesight, and assisted me up to
bed with such a strong hand that I seemed to have fifty boots on, and
to be dangling them all against the edges of the stairs. My state of
mind, as I have described it, began before I was up in the morning,
and lasted long after the subject had died out, and had ceased to be
mentioned saving on exceptional occasions.
CHAPTER VII
At the time when I stood in the churchyard, reading the family
tombstones, I had just enough learning to be able to spell them out.
My construction even of their simple meaning was not very correct,
for I read “wife of the Above” as a complimentary reference to my
father’s exaltation to a better world; and if any one of my deceased
relations had been referred to as “Below,” I have no doubt I should
have formed the worst opinions of that member of the family.
Neither, were my notions of the theological positions to which my
Catechism bound me, at all accurate; for, I have a lively remembrance
that I supposed my declaration that I was to “walk in the same all the
days of my life,”* laid me under an obligation always to go through
the village from our house in one particular direction, and never to
vary it by turning down by the wheelwright’s or up by the mill.
When I was old enough, I was to be apprenticed to Joe, and until I
could assume that dignity I was not to be what Mrs. Joe called
“Pompeyed,” or (as I render it) pampered. Therefore, I was not only
odd-boy about the forge, but if any neighbour happened to want an
extra boy to frighten birds, or pick up stones, or do any such job, I
was favoured with the employment. In order, however, that our
superior position might not be compromised thereby, a money-box
was kept on the kitchen mantelshelf, into which it was publicly made
known that all my earnings were dropped. I have an impression that
they were to be contributed eventually towards the liquidation of the
National Debt,* but I know I had no hope of any personal participation in the treasure.
Mr. Wopsle’s great-aunt kept an evening school* in the village;
vii] Volume I Chapter VII 39
that is to say, she was a ridiculous old woman of limited means and
unlimited infirmity, who used to go to sleep from six to seven every
evening, in the society of youth who paid twopence per week each,
for the improving opportunity of seeing her do it. She rented a small
cottage, and Mr. Wopsle had the room upstairs where we students
used to overhear him reading aloud in a most dignified and terrific
manner, and occasionally bumping on the ceiling. There was a fiction
that Mr. Wopsle “examined” the scholars, once a quarter. What he
did on those occasions, was to turn up his cuffs, stick up his hair, and
give us Mark Antony’s oration over the body of Cæsar. This was
always followed by Collins’s Ode on the Passions,* wherein I particularly venerated Mr. Wopsle as Revenge, throwing his bloodstain’d sword in thunder down, and taking the War denouncing
trumpet with a withering look. It was not with me then, as it was in
later life, when I fell into the society of the Passions, and compared
them with Collins and Wopsle, rather to the disadvantage of both
gentlemen.
Mr. Wopsle’s great-aunt, besides keeping this Educational Institution, kept––in the same room––a little general shop. She had no idea
what stock she had, or what the price of anything in it was; but there
was a little greasy memorandum-book kept in a drawer, which served
as a Catalogue of Prices, and by this oracle Biddy arranged all the
shop transactions. Biddy was Mr. Wopsle’s great-aunt’s granddaughter; I confess myself quite unequal to the working-out of the
problem, what relation she was to Mr. Wopsle. She was an orphan
like myself; like me, too, had been brought up by hand. She was most
noticeable, I thought, in respect of her extremities; for, her hair
always wanted brushing, her hands always wanted washing, and her
shoes always wanted mending and pulling up at heel. This description must be received with a week-day limitation. On Sundays, she
went to church elaborated.
Much of my unassisted self, and more by the help of Biddy than
of Mr. Wopsle’s great-aunt, I struggled through the alphabet as if it
had been a bramble-bush; getting considerably worried and
scratched by every letter. After that, I fell among those thieves,* the
nine figures, who seemed every evening to do something new to
disguise themselves and baffle recognition. But, at last I began, in a
purblind groping way, to read, write, and cipher, on the very smallest
scale.
40 Great Expectations
One night, I was sitting in the chimney corner with my slate,
expending great effort on the production of a letter to Joe. I think it
must have been a full year after our hunt upon the marshes, for it was
a long time after, and it was winter and a hard frost. With an alphabet
on the hearth at my feet for reference, I contrived in an hour or two
to print and smear this epistle:
“mI deEr JO i opE U r krWitE wEll i opE i shAl soN B
haBelL 4 2 teeDge U JO aN theN wE shOrl b sO glOdd aN
wEn i M preNgtD 2 u JO woT larX an blEvE ME inF xn PiP.”
There was no indispensable necessity for my communicating with
Joe by letter, inasmuch as he sat beside me and we were alone. But, I
delivered this written communication (slate and all) with my own
hand, and Joe received it as a miracle of erudition.
“I say, Pip, old chap!” cried Joe, opening his blue eyes wide, “what
a scholar you are! An’t you?”
“I should like to be,” said I, glancing at the slate as he held it: with
a misgiving that the writing was rather hilly.
“Why, here’s a J,” said Joe, “and a O equal to anythink! Here’s a J
and a O, Pip, and a J-O, Joe.”
I had never heard Joe read aloud to any greater extent than this
monosyllable, and I had observed at church last Sunday when I
accidentally held our Prayer-Book upside down, that it seemed to
suit his convenience quite as well as if it had been all right. Wishing
to embrace the present occasion of finding out whether in teaching
Joe, I should have to begin quite at the beginning, I said, “Ah! But
read the rest, Joe.”
“The rest, eh, Pip?” said Joe, looking at it with a slowly searching
eye, “One, two, three. Why, here’s three Js, and three Os, and three
J-O, Joes in it, Pip!”
I leaned over Joe, and, with the aid of my forefinger, read him the
whole letter.
“Astonishing!” said Joe, when I had finished. “You are a scholar.”
“How do you spell Gargery, Joe?” I asked him, with a modest
patronage.
“I don’t spell it at all,” said Joe.
“But supposing you did?”
“It can’t be supposed,” said Joe. “Tho’ I’m oncommon fond of
reading, too.”
“Are you, Joe?”
vii] Volume I Chapter VII 41
“On-common. Give me,” said Joe, “a good book, or a good newspaper, and sit me down afore a good fire, and I ask no better. Lord!”
he continued, after rubbing his knees a little, “when you do come to a
J and a O, and says you, ‘Here, at last, is a J-O, Joe,’ how interesting
reading is!”
I derived from this, that Joe’s education, like Steam, was yet in its
infancy. Pursuing the subject, I inquired:
“Didn’t you ever go to school, Joe, when you were as little as me?”
“No, Pip.”
“Why didn’t you ever go to school, Joe, when you were as little as
me?”
“Well, Pip,” said Joe, taking up the poker, and settling himself to
his usual occupation when he was thoughtful, of slowly raking the
fire between the lower bars: “I’ll tell you. My father, Pip, he were
given to drink, and when he were overtook with drink, he hammered
away at my mother,* most onmerciful. It were a’most the only hammering he did, indeed, ’xcepting at myself. And he hammered at me
with a wigour only to be equalled by the wigour with which he didn’t
hammer at his anwil.––You’re a listening and understanding, Pip?”
“Yes, Joe.”
“ ’Consequence, my mother and me we ran away from my father,
several times; and then my mother she’d go out to work, and she’d
say, ‘Joe,’ she’d say, ‘now, please God, you shall have some schooling,
child,’ and she’d put me to school. But my father were that good in
his hart that he couldn’t abear to be without us. So, he’d come with a
most tremenjous crowd and make such a row at the doors of the
houses where we was, that they used to be obligated to have no more
to do with us and to give us up to him. And then he took us home
and hammered us. Which, you see, Pip,” said Joe, pausing in his
meditative raking of the fire, and looking at me, “were a drawback on
my learning.”
“Certainly, poor Joe!”
“Though mind you, Pip,” said Joe, with a judicial touch or two of
the poker on the top bar, “rendering unto all their doo,* and maintaining equal justice betwixt man and man, my father were that good
in his hart, don’t you see?”
I didn’t see; but I didn’t say so.
“Well!” Joe pursued, “somebody must keep the pot a biling,* Pip,
or the pot won’t bile, don’t you know?”
42 Great Expectations
I saw that, and said so.
“’Consequence, my father didn’t make objections to my going to
work; so I went to work at my present calling, which were his too, if
he would have followed it, and I worked tolerable hard, I assure you,
Pip. In time I were able to keep him, and I kep him till he went off in
a purple leptic fit.* And it were my intentions to have had put upon
his tombstone that Whatsume’er the failings on his part, Remember
reader he were that good in his hart.”
Joe recited this couplet with such manifest pride and careful perspicuity, that I asked him if he had made it himself?
“I made it,” said Joe, “my own self. I made it in a moment. It was
like striking out a horseshoe complete, in a single blow. I never was so
much surprised in all my life––couldn’t credit my own ed––to tell
you the truth, hardly believed it were my own ed. As I was saying,
Pip, it were my intentions to have had it cut over him; but poetry
costs money, cut it how you will, small or large, and it were not done.
Not to mention bearers, all the money that could be spared were
wanted for my mother. She were in poor elth, and quite broke. She
weren’t long of following, poor soul, and her share of peace come
round at last.”
Joe’s blue eyes turned a little watery; he rubbed, first one of them,
and then the other, in a most uncongenial and uncomfortable manner, with the round knob on the top of the poker.
“It were but lonesome then,” said Joe, “living here alone, and I got
acquainted with your sister. Now, Pip;” Joe looked firmly at me, as if
he knew I was not going to agree with him; “your sister is a fine
figure of a woman.”
I could not help looking at the fire, in an obvious state of doubt.
“Whatever family opinions, or whatever the world’s opinions, on
that subject may be, Pip, your sister is,” Joe tapped the top bar with
the poker after every word following “a––fine––figure––of––a––
woman!”
I could think of nothing better to say than “I am glad you think so,
Joe.”
“So am I,” returned Joe, catching me up. “I am glad I think so,
Pip. A little redness, or a little matter of Bone, here or there, what
does it signify to Me?”
I sagaciously observed, if it didn’t signify to him, to whom did it
signify?
vii] Volume I Chapter VII 43
“Certainly!” assented Joe. “That’s it. You’re right, old chap!
When I got acquainted with your sister, it were the talk how she was
bringing you up by hand. Very kind of her too, all the folks said, and
I said, along with all the folks. As to you,” Joe pursued, with a
countenance expressive of seeing something very nasty indeed: “if
you could have been aware how small and flabby and mean you was,
dear me, you’d have formed the most contemptible opinions of
yourself! ”
Not exactly relishing this, I said, “Never mind me, Joe.”
“But I did mind you, Pip,” he returned with tender simplicity.
“When I offered to your sister to keep company, and to be asked in
church at such times as she was willing and ready to come to the
forge, I said to her, ‘And bring the poor little child. God bless the
poor little child,’ I said to your sister, ‘there’s room for him at
the forge!’ ”
I broke out crying and begging pardon, and hugged Joe round the
neck: who dropped the poker to hug me, and to say, “Ever the best of
friends; an’t us, Pip? Don’t cry, old chap!”
When this little interruption was over, Joe resumed:
“Well, you see, Pip, and here we are! That’s about where it lights;
here we are! Now, when you take me in hand in my learning, Pip
(and I tell you beforehand I am awful dull, most awful dull), Mrs. Joe
mustn’t see too much of what we’re up to. It must be done, as I may
say, on the sly. And why on the sly? I’ll tell you why, Pip.”
He had taken up the poker again; without which, I doubt if he
could have proceeded in his demonstration.
“Your sister is given to government.”
“Given to government, Joe?” I was startled, for I had some shadowy idea (and I am afraid I must add, hope) that Joe had divorced her
in favour of the Lords of the Admiralty, or Treasury.
“Given to government,” said Joe. “Which I meantersay the government of you and myself.”
“Oh!”
“And she an’t over partial to having scholars on the premises,” Joe
continued, “and in partickler would not be over partial to my being a
scholar, for fear as I might rise. Like a sort of rebel, don’t you see?”
I was going to retort with an inquiry, and had got as far as
“Why––––” when Joe stopped me.
“Stay a bit. I know what you’re a going to say, Pip; stay a bit! I
44 Great Expectations
don’t deny that your sister comes the Mo-gul* over us, now and
again. I don’t deny that she do throw us back-falls, and that she do
drop down upon us heavy. At such times as when your sister is on
the Ram-page, Pip,” Joe sank his voice to a whisper and glanced at
the door, “cander compels fur to admit that she is a Buster.”*
Joe pronounced this word, as if it began with at least twelve capital
Bs.
“Why don’t I rise? That were your obserwation when I broke it
off, Pip?”
“Yes, Joe.”
“Well,” said Joe, passing the poker into his left hand, that he
might feel his whisker; and I had no hope of him whenever he took to
that placid occupation; “your sister’s a master-mind. A mastermind.”
“What’s that?” I asked, in some hope of bringing him to a stand.
But, Joe was readier with his definition than I had expected, and
completely stopped me by arguing circularly, and answering with a
fixed look, “Her.”
“And I an’t a master-mind,” Joe resumed, when he had unfixed
his look, and got back to his whisker. “And last of all, Pip––and this I
want to say very serous to you, old chap––I see so much in my poor
mother, of a woman drudging and slaving and breaking her honest
hart and never getting no peace in her mortal days, that I’m dead
afeerd of going wrong in the way of not doing what’s right by a
woman, and I’d fur rather of the two go wrong the t’other way, and
be a little ill-conwenienced myself. I wish it was only me that got put
out, Pip; I wish there warn’t no Tickler for you, old chap; I wish I
could take it all on myself; but this is the up-and-down-and-straight
on it, Pip, and I hope you’ll overlook short-comings.”
Young as I was, I believe that I dated a new admiration of Joe from
that night. We were equals afterwards, as we had been before; but,
afterwards at quiet times when I sat looking at Joe and thinking
about him, I had a new sensation of feeling conscious that I was
looking up to Joe in my heart.
“Howsumever,” said Joe, rising to replenish the fire; “here’s
the Dutch clock a working himself up to being equal to strike
Eight of ’em, and she’s not come home yet! I hope Uncle
Pumblechook’s mare mayn’t have set a fore-foot on a piece o’ ice, and
gone down.”
vii] Volume I Chapter VII 45
Mrs. Joe made occasional trips with Uncle Pumblechook on
market-days, to assist him in buying such household stuffs and
goods as required a woman’s judgment; Uncle Pumblechook being a
bachelor and reposing no confidences in his domestic servant. This
was market-day, and Mrs. Joe was out on one of these expeditions.
Joe made the fire and swept the hearth, and then we went to the
door to listen for the chaise-cart. It was a dry cold night, and the
wind blew keenly, and the frost was white and hard. A man would die
to-night of lying out on the marshes, I thought. And then I looked at
the stars, and considered how awful it would be for a man to turn his
face up to them as he froze to death, and see no help or pity in all the
glittering multitude.
“Here comes the mare,” said Joe, “ringing like a peal of bells!”
The sound of her iron shoes upon the hard road was quite musical, as she came along at a much brisker trot than usual. We got a chair
out, ready for Mrs. Joe’s alighting, and stirred up the fire that they
might see a bright window, and took a final survey of the kitchen that
nothing might be out of its place. When we had completed these
preparations, they drove up, wrapped to the eyes. Mrs. Joe was soon
landed, and Uncle Pumblechook was soon down too, covering the
mare with a cloth, and we were soon all in the kitchen, carrying so
much cold air in with us that it seemed to drive all the heat out of the
fire.
“Now,” said Mrs. Joe, unwrapping herself with haste and excitement, and throwing her bonnet back on her shoulders where it hung
by the strings: “if this boy an’t grateful this night, he never will be!”
I looked as grateful as any boy possibly could, who was wholly
uninformed why he ought to assume that expression.
“It’s only to be hoped,” said my sister, “that he won’t be Pompeyed.* But I have my fears.”
“She ain’t in that line, Mum,” said Mr. Pumblechook. “She
knows better.”
She? I looked at Joe, making the motion with my lips and eyebrows, “She?” Joe looked at me, making the motion with his lips and
eyebrows, “She?” My sister catching him in the act, he drew the
back of his hand across his nose with his usual conciliatory air on
such occasions, and looked at her.
“Well?” said my sister, in her snappish way. “What are you staring
at? Is the house a-fire?”
46 Great Expectations
“––Which some indiwidual,” Joe politely hinted, “mentioned––
she.”
“And she is a she, I suppose?” said my sister. “Unless you call
Miss Havisham a he. And I doubt if even you’ll go so far as that.”
“Miss Havisham, up town?” said Joe.
“Is there any Miss Havisham down town?” returned my sister.
“She wants this boy to go and play there. And of course he’s going.
And he had better play there,” said my sister, shaking her head at me
as an encouragement to be extremely light and sportive, “or I’ll work
him.”
I had heard of Miss Havisham up town––everybody for miles
round, had heard of Miss Havisham up town––as an immensely rich
and grim lady who lived in a large and dismal house barricaded
against robbers, and who led a life of seclusion.
“Well to be sure!” said Joe, astounded. “I wonder how she came to
know Pip!”
“Noodle!” cried my sister. “Who said she knew him?”
“––Which some indiwidual,” Joe again politely hinted, “mentioned that she wanted him to go and play there.”
“And couldn’t she ask Uncle Pumblechook if he knew of a boy to
go and play there? Isn’t it just barely possible that Uncle Pumblechook may be a tenant of hers, and that he may sometimes––we
won’t say quarterly or half yearly, for that would be requiring too
much of you––but sometimes––go there to pay his rent? And
couldn’t she then ask Uncle Pumblechook if he knew of a boy to go
and play there? And couldn’t Uncle Pumblechook, being always
considerate and thoughtful for us––though you may not think it,
Joseph,” in a tone of the deepest reproach, as if he were the most
callous of nephews, “then mention this boy, standing Prancing
here”––which I solemnly declare I was not doing––“that I have for
ever been a willing slave to?”
“Good again!” cried Uncle Pumblechook. “Well put! Prettily
pointed! Good indeed! Now Joseph, you know the case.”
“No, Joseph,” said my sister, still in a reproachful manner, while
Joe apologetically drew the back of his hand across and across his
nose, “you do not yet––though you may not think it––know the case.
You may consider that you do, but you do not, Joseph. For you do not
know that Uncle Pumblechook, being sensible that for anything
we can tell, this boy’s fortune may be made by his going to Miss
vii] Volume I Chapter VII 47
Havisham’s, has offered to take him into town to-night in his own
chaise-cart, and to keep him to-night, and to take him with his own
hands to Miss Havisham’s to-morrow morning. And Lor-a-mussy*
me!” cried my sister, casting off her bonnet in sudden desperation,
“here I stand talking to mere Mooncalfs,* with Uncle Pumblechook
waiting, and the mare catching cold at the door, and the boy grimed
with crock* and dirt from the hair of his head to the sole of his foot!”
With that, she pounced upon me, like an eagle on a lamb, and my
face was squeezed into wooden bowls in sinks, and my head was put
under taps of water-butts, and I was soaped, and kneaded, and towelled, and thumped, and harrowed, and rasped, until I really was
quite beside myself. (I may here remark that I suppose myself to be
better acquainted than any living authority, with the ridgy effect
of a wedding-ring, passing unsympathetically over the human
countenance.)*
When my ablutions were completed, I was put into clean linen of
the stiffest character, like a young penitent into sackcloth, and was
trussed up in my tightest and fearfullest suit. I was then delivered
over to Mr. Pumblechook, who formally received me as if he were
the Sheriff, and who let off upon me the speech that I knew he had
been dying to make all along: “Boy, be for ever grateful to all friends,
but especially unto them which brought you up by hand!”
“Good-by, Joe!”
“God bless you, Pip, old chap!”
I had never parted from him before, and what with my feelings
and what with soap-suds, I could at first see no stars from the chaisecart. But they twinkled out one by one, without throwing any light
on the questions why on earth I was going to play at Miss
Havisham’s and what on earth I was expected to play at.
CHAPTER VIII
Mr. Pumblechook’s premises in the High-street of the market
town, were of a peppercorny and farinaceous character, as the premises of a corn-chandler and seedsman should be. It appeared to me
that he must be a very happy man indeed, to have so many little
drawers in his shop; and I wondered when I peeped into one or two
on the lower tiers, and saw the tied-up brown paper packets inside,
48 Great Expectations
whether the flower-seeds and bulbs ever wanted of a fine day to
break out of those jails, and bloom.
It was in the early morning after my arrival that I entertained this
speculation. On the previous night, I had been sent straight to bed in
an attic with a sloping roof, which was so low in the corner where the
bedstead was, that I calculated the tiles as being within a foot of my
eyebrows. In the same early morning, I discovered a singular affinity
between seeds and corduroys. Mr. Pumblechook wore corduroys,
and so did his shopman; and somehow, there was a general air and
flavour about the corduroys, so much in the nature of seeds, and a
general air and flavour about the seeds, so much in the nature of
corduroys, that I hardly knew which was which. The same opportunity served me for noticing that Mr. Pumblechook appeared to conduct his business by looking across the street at the saddler, who
appeared to transact his business by keeping his eye on the coachmaker, who appeared to get on in life by putting his hands in his
pockets and contemplating the baker, who in his turn folded his
arms and stared at the grocer, who stood at his door and yawned at
the chemist. The watch-maker, always poring over a little desk with a
magnifying glass at his eye, and always inspected by a group in
smock-frocks poring over him through the glass of his shop-window,
seemed to be about the only person in the High-street whose trade
engaged his attention.
Mr. Pumblechook and I breakfasted at eight o’clock in the parlour
behind the shop, while the shopman took his mug of tea and hunch*
of bread-and-butter on a sack of peas in the front premises. I considered Mr. Pumblechook wretched company. Besides being possessed by my sister’s idea that a mortifying and penitential character
ought to be imparted to my diet––besides giving me as much crumb
as possible in combination with as little butter, and putting such a
quantity of warm water into my milk that it would have been more
candid to have left the milk out altogether––his conversation consisted of nothing but arithmetic. On my politely bidding him Good
morning, he said, pompously, “Seven times nine, boy!” And how
should I be able to answer dodged in that way, in a strange place, on
an empty stomach! I was hungry, but before I had swallowed a morsel, he began a running sum that lasted all through the breakfast.
“Seven?” “And four?” “And eight?” “And six?” “And two?” “And
ten?” And so on. And after each figure was disposed of, it was as much
viii] Volume I Chapter VIII 49
as I could do to get a bite or a sup, before the next came; while he sat
at his ease guessing nothing, and eating bacon and hot roll, in (if I
may be allowed the expression) a gorging and gormandising manner.
For such reasons, I was very glad when ten o’clock came and we
started for Miss Havisham’s; though I was not at all at my ease
regarding the manner in which I should acquit myself under that
lady’s roof. Within a quarter of an hour we came to Miss Havisham’s
house,* which was of old brick, and dismal, and had a great many
iron bars to it. Some of the windows had been walled up; of those
that remained, all the lower were rustily barred. There was a courtyard in front, and that was barred; so, we had to wait, after ringing
the bell, until some one should come to open it. While we waited at
the gate, I peeped in (even then Mr. Pumblechook said, “And fourteen?” but I pretended not to hear him), and saw that at the side of
the house there was a large brewery. No brewing was going on in it,
and none seemed to have gone on for a long long time.
A window was raised, and a clear voice demanded “What name?”
To which my conductor replied, “Pumblechook.” The voice
returned, “Quite right,” and the window was shut again, and a
young lady came across the court-yard, with keys in her hand.
“This,” said Mr. Pumblechook, “is Pip.”
“This is Pip, is it?” returned the young lady, who was very pretty
and seemed very proud; “come in, Pip.”
Mr. Pumblechook was coming in also, when she stopped him with
the gate.
“Oh!” she said. “Did you wish to see Miss Havisham?”
“If Miss Havisham wished to see me,” returned Mr. Pumblechook, discomfited.
“Ah!” said the girl; “but you see she don’t.”
She said it so finally, and in such an undiscussible way, that Mr.
Pumblechook, though in a condition of ruffled dignity, could not
protest. But he eyed me severely––as if I had done anything to
him!––and departed with the words reproachfully delivered: “Boy!
Let your behaviour here be a credit unto them which brought you up
by hand!” I was not free from apprehension that he would come back
to propound through the gate, “And sixteen?” But he didn’t.
My young conductress locked the gate, and we went across the
court-yard. It was paved and clean, but grass was growing in every
crevice. The brewery buildings had a little lane of communication
50 Great Expectations
with it; and the wooden gates of that lane stood open, and all the
brewery beyond, stood open, away to the high enclosing wall; and all
was empty and disused. The cold wind seemed to blow colder there,
than outside the gate; and it made a shrill noise in howling in and out
at the open sides of the brewery, like the noise of wind in the rigging
of a ship at sea.
She saw me looking at it, and she said, “You could drink without
hurt all the strong beer that’s brewed there now, boy.”
“I should think I could, miss,” said I, in a shy way.
“Better not try to brew beer there now, or it would turn out sour,
boy; don’t you think so?”
“It looks like it, miss.”
“Not that anybody means to try,” she added, “for that’s all done
with, and the place will stand as idle as it is, till it falls. As to strong
beer, there’s enough of it in the cellars already, to drown the Manor
House.”
“Is that the name of this house, miss?”
“One of its names, boy.”
“It has more than one, then, miss?”
“One more. Its other name was Satis; which is Greek, or Latin, or
Hebrew, or all three––or all one to me––for enough.”
“Enough House,” said I; “that’s a curious name, miss.”
“Yes,” she replied; “but it meant more than it said. It meant, when
it was given, that whoever had this house, could want nothing else.
They must have been easily satisfied in those days, I should think.
But don’t loiter, boy.”
Though she called me “boy” so often, and with a carelessness that
was far from complimentary, she was of about my own age. She
seemed much older than I, of course, being a girl, and beautiful and
self-possessed; and she was as scornful of me as if she had been oneand-twenty, and a queen.
We went into the house by a side door––the great front entrance
had two chains across it outside––and the first thing I noticed was,
that the passages were all dark, and that she had left a candle burning
there. She took it up, and we went through more passages and up a
staircase, and still it was all dark, and only the candle lighted us.
At last we came to the door of a room, and she said, “Go in.”
I answered, more in shyness than politeness, “After you, miss.”
To this, she returned: “Don’t be ridiculous, boy; I am not going
viii] Volume I Chapter VIII 51
in.” And scornfully walked away, and––what was worse––took the
candle with her.
This was very uncomfortable, and I was half afraid. However, the
only thing to be done being to knock at the door, I knocked, and was
told from within to enter. I entered, therefore, and found myself in a
pretty large room, well lighted with wax candles. No glimpse of
daylight was to be seen in it. It was a dressing-room, as I supposed
from the furniture, though much of it was of forms and uses then
quite unknown to me. But prominent in it was a draped table with a
gilded looking-glass, and that I made out at first sight to be a fine
lady’s dressing-table.
Whether I should have made out this object so soon, if there had
been no fine lady sitting at it, I cannot say. In an armchair, with an
elbow resting on the table and her head leaning on that hand, sat the
strangest lady I have ever seen,* or shall ever see.
She was dressed in rich materials––satins, and lace, and silks––all
of white. Her shoes were white. And she had a long white veil
dependent from her hair, and she had bridal flowers in her hair, but
her hair was white. Some bright jewels sparkled on her neck and on
her hands, and some other jewels lay sparkling on the table. Dresses,
less splendid than the dress she wore, and half-packed trunks, were
scattered about. She had not quite finished dressing, for she had but
one shoe on––the other was on the table near her hand––her veil was
but half arranged, her watch and chain were not put on, and some
lace for her bosom lay with those trinkets, and with her handkerchief, and gloves, and some flowers, and a prayer-book, all confusedly heaped about the looking-glass.
It was not in the first moments that I saw all these things, though I
saw more of them in the first moments than might be supposed. But,
I saw that everything within my view which ought to be white, had
been white long ago, and had lost its lustre, and was faded and
yellow. I saw that the bride within the bridal dress had withered like
the dress, and like the flowers, and had no brightness left but the
brightness of her sunken eyes. I saw that the dress had been put
upon the rounded figure of a young woman, and that the figure upon
which it now hung loose, had shrunk to skin and bone. Once, I had
been taken to see some ghastly waxwork at the Fair, representing I
know not what impossible personage lying in state. Once, I had been
taken to one of our old marsh churches to see a skeleton in the ashes
52 Great Expectations
of a rich dress, that had been dug out of a vault under the church
pavement. Now, wax-work and skeleton seemed to have dark eyes
that moved and looked at me. I should have cried out, if I could.
“Who is it?” said the lady at the table.
“Pip, ma’am.”
“Pip?”
“Mr. Pumblechook’s boy, ma’am. Come––to play.”
“Come nearer; let me look at you. Come close.”
It was when I stood before her, avoiding her eyes, that I took note
of the surrounding objects in detail, and saw that her watch had
stopped at twenty minutes to nine, and that a clock in the room
had stopped at twenty minutes to nine.
“Look at me,” said Miss Havisham. “You are not afraid of a
woman who has never seen the sun since you were born?”
I regret to state that I was not afraid of telling the enormous lie
comprehended in the answer “No.”
“Do you know what I touch here?” she said, laying her hands, one
upon the other, on her left side.
“Yes, ma’am.” (It made me think of the young man.)
“What do I touch?”
“Your heart.”
“Broken!”
She uttered the word with an eager look, and with strong
emphasis, and with a weird smile that had a kind of boast in it.
Afterwards, she kept her hands there for a little while, and slowly
took them away as if they were heavy.
“I am tired,” said Miss Havisham. “I want diversion, and I have
done with men and women. Play.”
I think it will be conceded by my most disputatious reader, that
she could hardly have directed an unfortunate boy to do anything in
the wide world more difficult to be done under the circumstances.
“I sometimes have sick fancies,” she went on, “and I have a sick
fancy that I want to see some play. There, there!” with an impatient
movement of the fingers of her right hand; “play, play, play!”
For a moment, with the fear of my sister’s working me before my
eyes, I had a desperate idea of starting round the room in the
assumed character of Mr. Pumblechook’s chaise-cart. But, I felt
myself so unequal to the performance that I gave it up, and stood
looking at Miss Havisham in what I suppose she took for a dogged
viii] Volume I Chapter VIII 53
manner, inasmuch as she said, when we had taken a good look at each
other:
“Are you sullen and obstinate?”
“No, ma’am, I am very sorry for you, and very sorry I can’t play
just now. If you complain of me I shall get into trouble with my
sister, so I would do it if I could; but it’s so new here, and so strange,
and so fine––and melancholy––––” I stopped, fearing I might say
too much, or had already said it, and we took another long look at
each other.
Before she spoke again, she turned her eyes from me, and looked
at the dress she wore, and at the dressing-table, and finally at herself
in the looking-glass.
“So new to him,” she muttered, “so old to me; so strange to him,
so familiar to me; so melancholy to both of us! Call Estella.”
As she was still looking at the reflexion of herself, I thought she
was still talking to herself, and kept quiet.
“Call Estella,” she repeated, flashing a look at me. “You can do
that. Call Estella. At the door.”
To stand in the dark in a mysterious passage of an unknown
house, bawling Estella to a scornful young lady neither visible nor
responsive, and feeling it a dreadful liberty so to roar out her name,
was almost as bad as playing to order. But, she answered at last, and
her light came along the long dark passage like a star.
Miss Havisham beckoned her to come close, and took up a jewel
from the table, and tried its effect upon her fair young bosom and
against her pretty brown hair. “Your own, one day, my dear, and you
will use it well. Let me see you play cards with this boy.”
“With this boy! Why, he is a common labouring-boy!”
I thought I overheard Miss Havisham answer––only it seemed so
unlikely––“Well? You can break his heart.”
“What do you play, boy?” asked Estella of myself, with the greatest disdain.
“Nothing but beggar my neighbour,* miss.”
“Beggar him,” said Miss Havisham to Estella. So we sat down to
cards.
It was then I began to understand that everything in the room had
stopped, like the watch and the clock, a long time ago. I noticed that
Miss Havisham put down the jewel exactly on the spot from which
she had taken it up. As Estella dealt the cards, I glanced at the
54 Great Expectations
dressing-table again, and saw that the shoe upon it, once white, now
yellow, had never been worn. I glanced down at the foot from which
the shoe was absent, and saw that the silk stocking on it, once white,
now yellow, had been trodden ragged. Without this arrest of everything, this standing still of all the pale decayed objects, not even the
withered bridal dress on the collapsed form could have looked so like
grave-clothes, or the long veil so like a shroud.
So she sat, corpse-like, as we played at cards; the frillings and
trimmings on her bridal dress, looking like earthy paper. I knew
nothing then, of the discoveries that are occasionally made of bodies
buried in ancient times, which fall to powder in the moment of being
distinctly seen; but, I have often thought since, that she must have
looked as if the admission of the natural light of day would have
struck her to dust.*
“He calls the knaves, Jacks, this boy!” said Estella with disdain,
before our first game was out. “And what coarse hands he has. And
what thick boots!”
I had never thought of being ashamed of my hands before; but I
began to consider them a very indifferent pair. Her contempt was so
strong, that it became infectious, and I caught it.
She won the game, and I dealt. I misdealt, as was only natural,
when I knew she was lying in wait for me to do wrong; and she
denounced me for a stupid, clumsy labouring-boy.
“You say nothing of her,” remarked Miss Havisham to me, as she
looked on. “She says many hard things of you, but you say nothing
of her. What do you think of her?”
“I don’t like to say,” I stammered.
“Tell me in my ear,” said Miss Havisham, bending down.
“I think she is very proud,” I replied, in a whisper.
“Anything else?”
“I think she is very pretty.”
“Anything else?”
“I think she is very insulting.” (She was looking at me then, with a
look of supreme aversion.)
“Anything else?”
“I think I should like to go home.”
“And never see her again, though she is so pretty?”
“I am not sure that I shouldn’t like to see her again, but I should
like to go home now.”
viii] Volume I Chapter VIII 55
“You shall go soon,” said Miss Havisham, aloud. “Play the game
out.”
Saving for the one weird smile at first, I should have felt almost
sure that Miss Havisham’s face could not smile. It had dropped into
a watchful and brooding expression––most likely when all the things
about her had become transfixed––and it looked as if nothing could
ever lift it up again. Her chest had dropped, so that she stooped; and
her voice had dropped, so that she spoke low, and with a dead lull
upon her; altogether, she had the appearance of having dropped,
body and soul, within and without, under the weight of a crushing
blow.
I played the game to an end with Estella, and she beggared me.
She threw the cards down on the table when she had won them all, as
if she despised them for having been won of me.
“When shall I have you here again?” said Miss Havisham. “Let
me think.”
I was beginning to remind her that to-day was Wednesday, when
she checked me with her former impatient movement of the fingers
of her right hand.
“There, there! I know nothing of days of the week; I know nothing
of weeks of the year. Come again after six days. You hear?”
“Yes, ma’am.”
“Estella, take him down. Let him have something to eat, and let
him roam and look about him while he eats. Go, Pip.”
I followed the candle down, as I had followed the candle up, and
she stood it in the place where we had found it. Until she opened the
side entrance, I had fancied, without thinking about it, that it must
necessarily be night-time. The rush of the daylight quite confounded me, and made me feel as if I had been in the candlelight of
the strange room many hours.
“You are to wait here, you boy,” said Estella; and disappeared and
closed the door.
I took the opportunity of being alone in the court-yard, to look at
my coarse hands and my common boots. My opinion of those accessories was not favourable. They had never troubled me before, but
they troubled me now, as vulgar appendages. I determined to ask Joe
why he had ever taught me to call those picture-cards, Jacks, which
ought to be called knaves. I wished Joe had been rather more genteelly brought up, and then I should have been so too.
56 Great Expectations
She came back, with some bread and meat and a little mug of beer.
She put the mug down on the stones of the yard, and gave me the
bread and meat without looking at me, as insolently as if I were a dog
in disgrace. I was so humiliated, hurt, spurned, offended, angry,
sorry––I cannot hit upon the right name for the smart––God knows
what its name was––that tears started to my eyes. The moment they
sprang there, the girl looked at me with a quick delight in having
been the cause of them. This gave me power to keep them back and
to look at her: so, she gave me a contemptuous toss––but with a
sense, I thought, of having made too sure that I was so wounded––
and left me.
But, when she was gone, I looked about me for a place to hide my
face in, and got behind one of the gates in the brewery-lane, and
leaned my sleeve against the wall there, and leaned my forehead on it
and cried. As I cried, I kicked the wall, and took a hard twist at my
hair; so bitter were my feelings, and so sharp was the smart without a
name, that needed counteraction.
My sister’s bringing up had made me sensitive. In the little world
in which children have their existence whosoever brings them up,
there is nothing so finely perceived and so finely felt, as injustice. It
may be only small injustice that the child can be exposed to; but the
child is small, and its world is small, and its rocking-horse stands as
many hands high, according to scale, as a big-boned Irish hunter.
Within myself, I had sustained, from my babyhood, a perpetual conflict with injustice. I had known, from the time when I could speak,
that my sister, in her capricious and violent coercion, was unjust to
me. I had cherished a profound conviction that her bringing me up
by hand, gave her no right to bring me up by jerks. Through all my
punishments, disgraces, fasts and vigils, and other penitential performances, I had nursed this assurance; and to my communing so
much with it, in a solitary and unprotected way, I in great part refer
the fact that I was morally timid and very sensitive.
I got rid of my injured feelings for the time, by kicking them into
the brewery wall, and twisting them out of my hair, and then I
smoothed my face with my sleeve, and came from behind the gate.
The bread and meat were acceptable, and the beer was warming and
tingling, and I was soon in spirits to look about me.
To be sure, it was a deserted place, down to the pigeon-house in
the brewery-yard, which had been blown crooked on its pole by some
viii] Volume I Chapter VIII 57
high wind, and would have made the pigeons think themselves at
sea, if there had been any pigeons there to be rocked by it. But, there
were no pigeons in the dovecot, no horses in the stable, no pigs in the
sty, no malt in the storehouse, no smells of grains and beer in the
copper or the vat. All the uses and scents of the brewery might have
evaporated with its last reek of smoke. In a by-yard, there was a
wilderness of empty casks, which had a certain sour remembrance of
better days lingering about them; but it was too sour to be accepted
as a sample of the beer that was gone––and in this respect I remember those recluses as being like most others.
Behind the furthest end of the brewery, was a rank garden with an
old wall: not so high but that I could struggle up and hold on long
enough to look over it, and see that the rank garden was the garden
of the house, and that it was overgrown with tangled weeds, but that
there was a track upon the green and yellow paths, as if some one
sometimes walked there, and that Estella was walking away from me
even then. But she seemed to be everywhere. For, when I yielded to
the temptation presented by the casks, and began to walk on them, I
saw her walking on them at the end of the yard of casks. She had her
back towards me, and held her pretty brown hair spread out in her
two hands, and never looked round, and passed out of my view
directly. So, in the brewery itself––by which I mean the large paved
lofty place in which they used to make the beer, and where the
brewing utensils still were. When I first went into it, and, rather
oppressed by its gloom, stood near the door looking about me, I saw
her pass among the extinguished fires, and ascend some light iron
stairs, and go out by a gallery high overhead, as if she were going out
into the sky.
It was in this place, and at this moment, that a strange thing
happened to my fancy. I thought it a strange thing then, and I
thought it a stranger thing long afterwards. I turned my eyes––a
little dimmed by looking up at the frosty light––towards a great
wooden beam in a low nook of the building near me on my right
hand, and I saw a figure hanging there by the neck. A figure all in
yellow white, with but one shoe to the feet; and it hung so, that I
could see that the faded trimmings of the dress were like earthy
paper, and that the face was Miss Havisham’s, with a movement
going over the whole countenance as if she were trying to call to me.
In the terror of seeing the figure, and in the terror of being certain
58 Great Expectations
that it had not been there a moment before, I at first ran from it, and
then ran towards it. And my terror was greatest of all, when I found
no figure there.
Nothing less than the frosty light of the cheerful sky, the sight of
people passing beyond the bars of the court-yard gate, and the reviving influence of the rest of the bread and meat and beer, would have
brought me round. Even with those aids, I might not have come to
myself as soon as I did, but that I saw Estella approaching with the
keys, to let me out. She would have some fair reason for looking
down upon me, I thought, if she saw me frightened; and she should
have no fair reason.
She gave me a triumphant glance in passing me, as if she rejoiced
that my hands were so coarse and my boots were so thick, and she
opened the gate, and stood holding it. I was passing out without
looking at her, when she touched me with a taunting hand.
“Why don’t you cry?”
“Because I don’t want to.”
“You do,” said she. “You have been crying till you are half blind,
and you are near crying again now.”
She laughed contemptuously, pushed me out, and locked the gate
upon me. I went straight to Mr. Pumblechook’s, and was immensely
relieved to find him not at home. So, leaving word with the shopman
on what day I was wanted at Miss Havisham’s again, I set off on the
four-mile walk to our forge; pondering, as I went along, on all I had
seen, and deeply revolving that I was a common labouring-boy; that
my hands were coarse, that my boots were thick; that I had fallen
into a despicable habit of calling knaves Jacks; that I was much more
ignorant than I had considered myself last night, and generally that I
was in a low-lived bad way.
CHAPTER IX
When I reached home, my sister was very curious to know all about
Miss Havisham’s, and asked a number of questions. And I soon
found myself getting heavily bumped from behind in the nape of the
neck and the small of the back, and having my face ignominiously
shoved against the kitchen wall, because I did not answer those
questions at sufficient length.
ix] Volume I Chapter IX 59
If a dread of not being understood be hidden in the breasts of
other young people to anything like the extent to which it used to be
hidden in mine––which I consider probable, as I have no particular
reason to suspect myself of having been a monstrosity––it is the key
to many reservations. I felt convinced that if I described Miss Havisham’s as my eyes had seen it, I should not be understood. Not only
that, but I felt convinced that Miss Havisham too would not be
understood; and although she was perfectly incomprehensible to me,
I entertained an impression that there would be something coarse
and treacherous in my dragging her as she really was (to say nothing
of Miss Estella) before the contemplation of Mrs. Joe. Consequently,
I said as little as I could, and had my face shoved against the kitchen
wall.
The worst of it was that that bullying old Pumblechook, preyed
upon by a devouring curiosity to be informed of all I had seen and
heard, came gaping over in his chaise-cart at tea-time, to have the
details divulged to him. And the mere sight of the torment, with his
fishy eyes and mouth open, his sandy hair inquisitively on end, and
his waistcoat heaving with windy arithmetic,* made me vicious in
my reticence.
“Well, boy,” Uncle Pumblechook began, as soon as he was seated
in the chair of honour by the fire. “How did you get on up town?”
I answered, “Pretty well, sir,” and my sister shook her fist at me.
“Pretty well?” Mr. Pumblechook repeated. “Pretty well is no
answer. Tell us what you mean by pretty well, boy?”
Whitewash on the forehead hardens the brain into a state of
obstinacy perhaps. Anyhow, with whitewash from the wall on my
forehead, my obstinacy was adamantine. I reflected for some time,
and then answered as if I had discovered a new idea, “I mean pretty
well.”
My sister with an exclamation of impatience was going to fly at
me––I had no shadow of defence, for Joe was busy in the forge––
when Mr. Pumblechook interposed with “No! Don’t lose your
temper. Leave this lad to me, ma’am; leave this lad to me.” Mr.
Pumblechook then turned me towards him, as if he were going to
cut my hair, and said:
“First (to get our thoughts in order): Forty-three pence?”
I calculated the consequences of replying “Four Hundred
Pound,” and finding them against me, went as near the answer as I
60 Great Expectations
could––which was somewhere about eightpence off. Mr. Pumblechook then put me through my pence-table from “twelve pence
make one shilling,” up to “forty pence make three and fourpence,”
and then triumphantly demanded, as if he had done for me, “Now!
How much is forty-three pence?” To which I replied, after a long
interval of reflection, “I don’t know.” And I was so aggravated that I
almost doubt if I did know.
Mr. Pumblechook worked his head like a screw to screw it out of
me, and said, “Is forty-three pence seven and sixpence three
fardens,* for instance?”
“Yes!” said I. And although my sister instantly boxed my ears, it
was highly gratifying to me to see that the answer spoilt his joke, and
brought him to a dead stop.
“Boy! What like is Miss Havisham?” Mr. Pumblechook began
again when he had recovered; folding his arms tight on his chest and
applying the screw.
“Very tall and dark,” I told him.
“Is she, uncle?” asked my sister.
Mr. Pumblechook winked assent; from which I at once inferred
that he had never seen Miss Havisham, for she was nothing of the
kind.
“Good!” said Mr. Pumblechook, conceitedly. (“This is the way to
have him! We are beginning to hold our own, I think, Mum?”)
“I am sure, uncle,” returned Mrs. Joe, “I wish you had him
always: you know so well how to deal with him.”
“Now, boy! What was she a doing of when you went in to-day?”
asked Mr. Pumblechook.
“She was sitting,” I answered, “in a black velvet coach.”
Mr. Pumblechook and Mrs. Joe stared at one another––as they
well might––and both repeated, “In a black velvet coach?”
“Yes,” said I. “And Miss Estella––that’s her niece, I think––
handed her in cake and wine at the coach-window, on a gold plate.
And we all had cake and wine on gold plates. And I got up behind the
coach to eat mine, because she told me to.”
“Was anybody else there?” asked Mr. Pumblechook.
“Four dogs,” said I.
“Large or small?”
“Immense,” said I. “And they fought for veal cutlets out of a silver
basket.”
ix] Volume I Chapter IX 61
Mr. Pumblechook and Mrs. Joe stared at one another again, in
utter amazement. I was perfectly frantic––a reckless witness under
the torture––and would have told them anything.
“Where was this coach, in the name of gracious?” asked my sister.
“In Miss Havisham’s room.” They stared again. “But there
weren’t any horses to it.” I added this saving clause, in the moment
of rejecting four richly caparisoned coursers which I had had wild
thoughts of harnessing.
“Can this be possible, uncle?” asked Mrs. Joe. “What can the boy
mean?”
“I’ll tell you, Mum,” said Mr. Pumblechook. “My opinion is, it’s a
sedan-chair. She’s flighty, you know––very flighty*––quite flighty
enough to pass her days in a sedan-chair.”
“Did you ever see her in it, uncle?” asked Mrs. Joe.
“How could I?” he returned, forced to the admission, “when I
never see her in my life? Never clapped eyes upon her!”
“Goodness, uncle! And yet you have spoken to her?”
“Why, don’t you know,” said Mr. Pumblechook, testily, “that
when I have been there, I have been took up to the outside of her
door, and the door has stood ajar, and she has spoke to me that way.
Don’t say you don’t know that, Mum. Howsever, the boy went there
to play. What did you play at, boy?”
“We played with flags,” I said. (I beg to observe that I think of
myself with amazement, when I recal the lies I told on this occasion.)
“Flags!” echoed my sister.
“Yes,” said I. “Estella waved a blue flag, and I waved a red one, and
Miss Havisham waved one sprinkled all over with little gold stars,
out at the coach-window. And then we all waved our swords and
hurrahed.”
“Swords!” repeated my sister. “Where did you get swords from?”
“Out of a cupboard,” said I. “And I saw pistols in it––and jam––
and pills. And there was no daylight in the room, but it was lighted
up with candles.”
“That’s true, Mum,” said Mr. Pumblechook, with a grave nod.
“That’s the state of the case, for that much I’ve seen myself.” And
then they both stared at me, and I with an obtrusive show of artlessness on my countenance, stared at them, and plaited the right leg of
my trousers with my right hand.
If they had asked me any more questions I should undoubtedly
62 Great Expectations
have betrayed myself, for I was even then on the point of mentioning
that there was a balloon in the yard, and should have hazarded the
statement but for my invention being divided between that phenomenon and a bear in the brewery. They were so much occupied, however, in discussing the marvels I had already presented for their
consideration, that I escaped. The subject still held them when Joe
came in from his work to have a cup of tea. To whom my sister, more
for the relief of her own mind than for the gratification of his, related
my pretended experiences.
Now, when I saw Joe open his blue eyes and roll them all round the
kitchen in helpless amazement, I was overtaken by penitence; but
only as regarded him––not in the least as regarded the other two.
Towards Joe, and Joe only, I considered myself a young monster,
while they sat debating what results would come to me from Miss
Havisham’s acquaintance and favour. They had no doubt that Miss
Havisham would “do something” for me; their doubts related to the
form that something would take. My sister stood out for “property.”
Mr. Pumblechook was in favour of a handsome premium for binding
me apprentice to some genteel trade––say, the corn and seed trade,
for instance. Joe fell into the deepest disgrace with both, for offering
the bright suggestion that I might only be presented with one of the
dogs who had fought for the veal-cutlets. “If a fool’s head can’t
express better opinions than that,” said my sister, “and you have got
any work to do, you had better go and do it.” So he went.
After Mr. Pumblechook had driven off, and when my sister was
washing up, I stole into the forge to Joe, and remained by him until
he had done for the night. Then I said, “Before the fire goes out, Joe,
I should like to tell you something.”
“Should you, Pip?” said Joe, drawing his shoeing-stool near the
forge. “Then tell us. What is it, Pip?”
“Joe,” said I, taking hold of his rolled-up shirt-sleeve, and twisting
it between my finger and thumb, “you remember all that about Miss
Havisham’s?”
“Remember?” said Joe. “I believe you! Wonderful!”
“It’s a terrible thing, Joe; it ain’t true.”
“What are you telling of, Pip?” cried Joe, falling back in the greatest amazement. “You don’t mean to say it’s––––”
“Yes I do; it’s lies, Joe.”
“But not all of it? Why sure you don’t mean to say, Pip, that there
ix] Volume I Chapter IX 63
was no black welwet co––––eh?” For, I stood shaking my head. “But
at least there was dogs, Pip. Come, Pip,” said Joe, persuasively, “if
there warn’t no weal-cutlets, at least there was dogs?”
“No, Joe.”
“A dog?” said Joe. “A puppy? Come?”
“No, Joe, there was nothing at all of the kind.”
As I fixed my eyes hopelessly on Joe, Joe contemplated me in
dismay. “Pip, old chap! This won’t do, old fellow! I say! Where do
you expect to go to?”
“It’s terrible, Joe; an’t it?”
“Terrible?” cried Joe. “Awful! What possessed you?”
“I don’t know what possessed me, Joe,” I replied, letting his shirt
sleeve go, and sitting down in the ashes at his feet, hanging my head;
“but I wish you hadn’t taught me to call Knaves at cards, Jacks; and I
wish my boots weren’t so thick nor my hands so coarse.”
And then I told Joe that I felt very miserable, and that I hadn’t
been able to explain myself to Mrs. Joe and Pumblechook who were
so rude to me, and that there had been a beautiful young lady at Miss
Havisham’s who was dreadfully proud, and that she had said I was
common, and that I knew I was common, and that I wished I was not
common, and that the lies had come of it somehow, though I didn’t
know how.
This was a case of metaphysics, at least as difficult for Joe to deal
with, as for me. But Joe took the case altogether out of the region of
metaphysics, and by that means vanquished it.
“There’s one thing you may be sure of, Pip,” said Joe, after some
rumination, “namely, that lies is lies. Howsever they come, they
didn’t ought to come, and they come from the father of lies,* and
work round to the same. Don’t you tell no more of ’em, Pip. That
ain’t the way to get out of being common, old chap. And as to being
common, I don’t make it out at all clear. You are oncommon in some
things. You’re oncommon small. Likewise you’re a oncommon
scholar.”
“No, I am ignorant and backward, Joe.”
“Why, see what a letter you wrote last night. Wrote in print even!
I’ve seen letters––Ah! and from gentlefolks!––that I’ll swear weren’t
wrote in print,” said Joe.
“I have learnt next to nothing, Joe. You think much of me. It’s
only that.”
64 Great Expectations
“Well, Pip,” said Joe, “be it so or be it son’t, you must be a
common scholar afore you can be a oncommon one, I should hope!
The king upon his throne, with his crown upon his ed, can’t sit and
write his acts of Parliament in print, without having begun, when he
were a unpromoted Prince, with the alphabet––Ah!” added Joe, with
a shake of the head that was full of meaning, “and begun at A too,
and worked his way to Z. And I know what that is to do, though I
can’t say I’ve exactly done it.”
There was some hope in this piece of wisdom, and it rather
encouraged me.
“Whether common ones as to callings and earnings,” pursued Joe,
reflectively “mightn’t be the better of continuing fur to keep company with common ones, instead of going out to play with oncommon ones––which reminds me to hope that there were a flag,
perhaps?”
“No, Joe.”
“(I’m sorry there weren’t a flag, Pip.) Whether that might be or
mightn’t be, is a thing as can’t be looked into now, without putting
your sister on the Rampage; and that’s a thing not to be thought of,
as being done intentional. Lookee here, Pip, at what is said to you by
a true friend. Which this to you the true friend say. If you can’t get to
be oncommon through going straight, you’ll never get to do it
through going crooked. So don’t tell no more on ’em, Pip, and live
well and die happy.”
“You are not angry with me, Joe?”
“No, old chap. But bearing in mind that them were which I
meantersay of a stunning and outdacious sort––alluding to them
which bordered on weal-cutlets and dog-fighting––a sincere wellwisher would adwise, Pip, their being dropped into your meditations,
when you go up-stairs to bed. That’s all, old chap, and don’t never
do it no more.”
When I got up to my little room and said my prayers, I did not
forget Joe’s recommendation, and yet my young mind was in that
disturbed and unthankful state, that I thought long after I laid me
down, how common Estella would consider Joe, a mere blacksmith:
how thick his boots, and how coarse his hands. I thought how Joe and
my sister were then sitting in the kitchen, and how I had come up to
bed from the kitchen, and how Miss Havisham and Estella never sat
in a kitchen, but were far above the level of such common doings. I
ix] Volume I Chapter IX 65
fell asleep recalling what I “used to do” when I was at Miss Havisham’s; as though I had been there weeks or months, instead of
hours; and as though it were quite an old subject of remembrance,
instead of one that had arisen only that day.
That was a memorable day to me, for it made great changes in me.
But, it is the same with any life. Imagine one selected day struck out
of it, and think how different its course would have been. Pause you
who read this, and think for a moment of the long chain of iron or
gold, of thorns or flowers, that would never have bound you, but for
the formation of the first link on one memorable day.
CHAPTER X
The felicitous idea occurred to me a morning or two later when I
woke, that the best step I could take towards making myself uncommon was to get out of Biddy everything she knew. In pursuance of
this luminous conception I mentioned to Biddy when I went to Mr.
Wopsle’s great-aunt’s at night, that I had a particular reason for
wishing to get on in life, and that I should feel very much obliged to
her if she would impart all her learning to me. Biddy, who was the
most obliging of girls, immediately said she would, and indeed began
to carry out her promise within five minutes.
The Educational scheme or Course established by Mr. Wopsle’s
great-aunt may be resolved into the following synopsis. The pupils
ate apples and put straws up one another’s backs, until Mr. Wopsle’s
great-aunt collected her energies, and made an indiscriminate totter
at them with a birch-rod. After receiving the charge with every mark
of derision, the pupils formed in line and buzzingly passed a ragged
book from hand to hand. The book had an alphabet in it, some
figures and tables, and a little spelling––that is to say, it had had once.
As soon as this volume began to circulate, Mr. Wopsle’s great-aunt
fell into a state of coma; arising either from sleep or a rheumatic
paroxysm. The pupils then entered among themselves upon a competitive examination on the subject of Boots, with the view of ascertaining who could tread the hardest upon whose toes. This mental
exercise lasted until Biddy made a rush at them and distributed three
defaced Bibles (shaped as if they had been unskilfully cut off the
chump-end of something), more illegibly printed at the best than
66 Great Expectations
any curiosities of literature I have since met with, speckled all over
with ironmould, and having various specimens of the insect world
smashed between their leaves. This part of the Course was usually
lightened by several single combats between Biddy and refractory
students. When the fights were over, Biddy gave out the number of
the page, and then we all read aloud what we could––or what we
couldn’t––in a frightful chorus; Biddy leading with a high shrill
monotonous voice, and none of us having the least notion of, or
reverence for, what we were reading about. When this horrible din
had lasted a certain time, it mechanically awoke Mr. Wopsle’s greataunt, who staggered at a boy fortuitously, and pulled his ears. This
was understood to terminate the Course for the evening, and we
emerged into the air with shrieks of intellectual victory. It is fair to
remark that there was no prohibition against any pupil’s entertaining
himself with a slate or even with the ink (when there was any), but
that it was not easy to pursue that branch of study in the winter
season, on account of the little general shop in which the classes
were holden––and which was also Mr. Wopsle’s great-aunt’s sittingroom and bed-chamber––being but faintly illuminated through the
agency of one low-spirited dip-candle and no snuffers.*
It appeared to me that it would take time, to become uncommon
under these circumstances: nevertheless, I resolved to try it, and that
very evening Biddy entered on our special agreement, by imparting
some information from her little catalogue of Prices, under the head
of moist sugar,* and lending me, to copy at home, a large old English
D* which she had imitated from the heading of some newspaper, and
which I supposed, until she told me what it was, to be a design for a
buckle.
Of course there was a public-house in the village, and of course
Joe liked sometimes to smoke his pipe there. I had received strict
orders from my sister to call for him at the Three Jolly Bargemen,
that evening, on my way from school, and bring him home at my
peril. To the Three Jolly Bargemen, therefore, I directed my steps.
There was a bar at the Jolly Bargemen, with some alarmingly long
chalk scores in it on the wall at the side of the door, which seemed to
me to be never paid off. They had been there ever since I could
remember, and had grown more than I had. But there was a quantity
of chalk about our country, and perhaps the people neglected no
opportunity of turning it to account.
x] Volume I Chapter X 67
It being Saturday night,* I found the landlord looking rather
grimly at these records, but as my business was with Joe and not with
him, I merely wished him good evening, and passed into the common room at the end of the passage, where there was a bright large
kitchen fire, and where Joe was smoking his pipe in company with
Mr. Wopsle and a stranger. Joe greeted me as usual with “Halloa,
Pip, old chap!” and the moment he said that, the stranger turned his
head and looked at me.
He was a secret-looking man whom I had never seen before. His
head was all on one side, and one of his eyes was half shut up, as if he
were taking aim at something with an invisible gun. He had a pipe in
his mouth, and he took it out, and, after slowly blowing all his smoke
away and looking hard at me all the time, nodded. So, I nodded, and
then he nodded again, and made room on the settle beside him that I
might sit down there.
But, as I was used to sit beside Joe whenever I entered that place
of resort, I said “No, thank you, sir,” and fell into the space Joe made
for me on the opposite settle. The strange man, after glancing at Joe,
and seeing that his attention was otherwise engaged, nodded to me
again when I had taken my seat, and then rubbed his leg––in a very
odd way, as it struck me.
“You was saying,” said the strange man, turning to Joe, “that you
was a blacksmith.”
“Yes. I said it, you know,” said Joe.
“What’ll you drink, Mr.––––? You didn’t mention your name, bythe-by.”
Joe mentioned it now, and the strange man called him by it.
“What’ll you drink, Mr. Gargery? At my expense? To top up with?”
“Well,” said Joe, “to tell you the truth, I ain’t much in the habit of
drinking at anybody’s expense but my own.”
“Habit? No,” returned the stranger, “but once and away, and on a
Saturday night too. Come! Put a name to it, Mr. Gargery.”
“I wouldn’t wish to be stiff company,” said Joe. “Rum.”
“Rum,” repeated the stranger. “And will the other gentleman
originate a sentiment?”
“Rum,” said Mr. Wopsle.
“Three Rums!” cried the stranger, calling to the landlord.
“Glasses round!”
“This other gentleman,” observed Joe, by way of introducing Mr.
68 Great Expectations
Wopsle, “is a gentleman that you would like to hear give it out. Our
clerk at church.”
“Aha!” said the stranger, quickly, and cocking his eye at me. “The
lonely church, right out on the marshes, with the graves round it!”
“That’s it,” said Joe.
The stranger, with a comfortable kind of grunt over his pipe, put
his legs up on the settle that he had to himself. He wore a flapping
broad-brimmed traveller’s hat, and under it a handkerchief tied over
his head in the manner of a cap: so that he showed no hair. As he
looked at the fire, I thought I saw a cunning expression, followed by a
half laugh, come into his face.
“I am not acquainted with this country, gentlemen, but it seems a
solitary country towards the river.”
“Most meshes is solitary,” said Joe.
“No doubt, no doubt. Do you find any gipsies, now, or tramps, or
vagrants of any sort, out there?”
“No,” said Joe; “none but a runaway convict now and then. And
we don’t find them, easy. Eh, Mr. Wopsle?”
Mr. Wopsle, with a majestic remembrance of old discomfiture,
assented; but not warmly.
“Seems you have been out after such?” asked the stranger.
“Once,” returned Joe. “Not that we wanted to take them, you
understand; we went out as lookers on; me, and Mr. Wopsle, and Pip.
Didn’t us, Pip?”
“Yes, Joe.”
The stranger looked at me again––still cocking his eye, as if he
were expressly taking aim at me with his invisible gun––and said,
“He’s a likely young parcel of bones that. What is it you call him?”
“Pip,” said Joe.
“Christened Pip?”
“No, not christened Pip.”
“Surname Pip?”
“No,” said Joe, “it’s a kind of a family name what he gave himself
when a infant, and is called by.”
“Son of yours?”
“Well,” said Joe, meditatively––not, of course, that it could be in
any wise necessary to consider about it, but because it was the way at
the Jolly Bargemen to seem to consider deeply about everything that
was discussed over pipes; “well––no. No, he ain’t.”
x] Volume I Chapter X 69
“Nevvy?” said the strange man.
“Well,” said Joe, with the same appearance of profound cogitation, “he is not––no, not to deceive you, he is not––my nevvy.”
“What the Blue Blazes is he?” asked the stranger. Which appeared
to me to be an inquiry of unnecessary strength.
Mr. Wopsle struck in upon that; as one who knew all about relationships, having professional occasion to bear in mind what female
relations a man might not marry;* and expounded the ties between
me and Joe. Having his hand in, Mr. Wopsle finished off with a most
terrifically snarling passage from Richard the Third,* and seemed
to think he had done quite enough to account for it when he added,
“––as the poet says.”
And here I may remark that when Mr. Wopsle referred to me, he
considered it a necessary part of such reference to rumple my hair
and poke it into my eyes. I cannot conceive why everybody of his
standing who visited at our house should always have put me
through the same inflammatory process under similar circumstances.
Yet I do not call to mind that I was ever in my earlier youth the
subject of remark in our social family circle, but some large-handed
person took some such ophthalmic steps to patronise me.
All this while, the strange man looked at nobody but me, and
looked at me as if he were determined to have a shot at me at last,
and bring me down. But he said nothing after offering his Blue
Blazes observation, until the glasses of rum-and-water were
brought; and then he made his shot, and a most extraordinary shot it
was.
It was not a verbal remark, but a proceeding in a dumb-show, and
was pointedly addressed to me. He stirred his rum-and-water pointedly at me, and he tasted his rum-and-water pointedly at me. And he
stirred and he tasted it: not with a spoon that was brought to him,
but with a file.
He did this so that nobody but I saw the file; and when he had
done it he wiped the file and put it in a breast-pocket. I knew it to be
Joe’s file, and I knew that he knew my convict, the moment I saw the
instrument. I sat gazing at him, spell-bound. But he now reclined on
his settle, taking very little notice of me, and talking principally
about turnips.
There was a delicious sense of cleaning-up and making a quiet
pause before going on in life afresh, in our village on Saturday
70 Great Expectations
nights, which stimulated Joe to dare to stay out half an hour longer
on Saturdays than at other times. The half-hour and the rum-andwater running out together, Joe got up to go, and took me by the
hand.
“Stop half a moment, Mr. Gargery,” said the strange man. “I
think I’ve got a bright new shilling somewhere in my pocket, and if I
have, the boy shall have it.”
He looked it out from a handful of small change, folded it in some
crumpled paper, and gave it to me. “Yours!” said he. “Mind! Your
own.”
I thanked him, staring at him far beyond the bounds of good
manners, and holding tight to Joe. He gave Joe good-night, and he
gave Mr. Wopsle good-night (who went out with us), and he gave me
only a look with his aiming eye––no, not a look, for he shut it up, but
wonders may be done with an eye by hiding it.
On the way home, if I had been in a humour for talking, the talk
must have been all on my side, for Mr. Wopsle parted from us at the
door of the Jolly Bargemen, and Joe went all the way home with his
mouth wide open, to rinse the rum out with as much air as possible.
But I was in a manner stupified by this turning up of my old misdeed
and old acquaintance, and could think of nothing else.
My sister was not in a very bad temper when we presented ourselves in the kitchen, and Joe was encouraged by that unusual circumstance to tell her about the bright shilling. “A bad un, I’ll be
bound,” said Mrs. Joe, triumphantly, “or he wouldn’t have given it to
the boy! Let’s look at it.”
I took it out of the paper, and it proved to be a good one. “But
what’s this?” said Mrs. Joe, throwing down the shilling and catching
up the paper. “Two One-Pound notes?”*
Nothing less than two fat sweltering one-pound notes that seemed
to have been on terms of the warmest intimacy with all the cattle
markets in the county. Joe caught up his hat again, and ran with
them to the Jolly Bargemen to restore them to their owner. While he
was gone, I sat down on my usual stool and looked vacantly at my
sister, feeling pretty sure that the man would not be there.
Presently, Joe came back, saying that the man was gone, but that
he, Joe, had left word at the Three Jolly Bargemen concerning the
notes. Then my sister sealed them up in a piece of paper, and put
them under some dried rose-leaves in an ornamental teapot on the
x] Volume I Chapter X 71
top of a press in the state parlour. There they remained, a nightmare
to me, many and many a night and day.
I had sadly broken sleep when I got to bed, through thinking of
the strange man taking aim at me with his invisible gun, and of the
guiltily coarse and common thing it was, to be on secret terms of
conspiracy with convicts––a feature in my low career that I had
previously forgotten. I was haunted by the file too. A dread possessed
me that when I least expected it, the file would reappear. I coaxed
myself to sleep by thinking of Miss Havisham’s, next Wednesday;
and in my sleep I saw the file coming at me out of a door, without
seeing who held it, and I screamed myself awake.
CHAPTER XI
At the appointed time I returned to Miss Havisham’s, and my
hesitating ring at the gate brought out Estella. She locked it after
admitting me, as she had done before, and again preceded me into
the dark passage where her candle stood. She took no notice of me
until she had the candle in her hand, when she looked over her
shoulder, superciliously saying, “You are to come this way to-day,”
and took me to quite another part of the house.
The passage was a long one, and seemed to pervade the whole
square basement of the Manor House. We traversed but one side of
the square, however; and at the end of it she stopped, and put her
candle down and opened a door. Here, the daylight reappeared, and I
found myself in a small paved court-yard, the opposite side of which
was formed by a detached dwelling-house, that looked as if it had
once belonged to the manager or head clerk of the extinct brewery.
There was a clock in the outer wall of this house. Like the clock in
Miss Havisham’s room, and like Miss Havisham’s watch, it had
stopped at twenty minutes to nine.
We went in at the door, which stood open, and into a gloomy room
with a low ceiling, on the ground floor at the back. There was some
company in the room, and Estella said to me as she joined it, “You
are to go and stand there, boy, till you are wanted.” “There,” being
the window, I crossed to it, and stood “there,” in a very uncomfortable state of mind, looking out.
It opened to the ground, and looked into a most miserable corner
72 Great Expectations
of the neglected garden, upon a rank ruin of cabbage-stalks, and one
box-tree that had been clipped round long ago, like a pudding, and
had a new growth at the top of it, out of shape and of a different
colour, as if that part of the pudding had stuck to the saucepan and
got burnt. This was my homely thought, as I contemplated the boxtree. There had been some light snow, over-night, and it lay nowhere
else to my knowledge; but, it had not quite melted from the cold
shadow of this bit of garden, and the wind caught it up in little
eddies and threw it at the window, as if it pelted me for coming there.
I divined that my coming had stopped conversation in the room,
and that its other occupants were looking at me. I could see nothing
of the room except the shining of the fire in the window-glass, but I
stiffened in all my joints with the consciousness that I was under
close inspection.
There were three ladies in the room and one gentleman. Before I
had been standing at the window five minutes, they somehow conveyed to me that they were all toadies and humbugs,* but that each
of them pretended not to know that the others were toadies and
humbugs: because the admission that he or she did know it, would
have made him or her out to be a toady and humbug.
They all had a listless and dreary air of waiting somebody’s pleasure, and the most talkative of the ladies had to speak quite rigidly to
repress a yawn. This lady, whose name was Camilla, very much
reminded me of my sister, with the difference that she was older, and
(as I found when I caught sight of her) of a blunter cast of features.
Indeed, when I knew her better I began to think it was a Mercy she had
any features at all, so very blank and high was the dead wall of her face.
“Poor dear soul!” said this lady, with an abruptness of manner
quite my sister’s. “Nobody’s enemy but his own!”
“It would be much more commendable to be somebody else’s
enemy,” said the gentleman; “far more natural.”
“Cousin Raymond,” observed another lady, “we are to love our
neighbour.”*
“Sarah Pocket,” returned Cousin Raymond, “if a man is not his
own neighbour, who is?”
Miss Pocket laughed, and Camilla laughed and said (checking a
yawn), “The idea!” But I thought they seemed to think it rather a
good idea too. The other lady, who had not spoken yet, said gravely
and emphatically, “Very true!”
“Poor soul!” Camilla presently went on (I knew they had all been
xi] Volume I Chapter XI 73
looking at me in the mean time), “he is so very strange! Would any
one believe that when Tom’s wife died, he actually could not be
induced to see the importance of the children’s having the deepest of
trimmings to their mourning? ‘Good Lord!’ said he, ‘Camilla, what
can it signify so long as the poor bereaved little things are in black?’
So like Matthew! The idea!”
“Good points in him, good points in him,” said Cousin Raymond;
“Heaven forbid I should deny good points in him; but he never had,
and he never will have, any sense of the proprieties.”
“You know I was obliged,” said Camilla, “I was obliged to be firm.
I said, ‘It will not do, for the credit of the family.’ I told him that,
without deep trimmings, the family was disgraced. I cried about it
from breakfast till dinner. I injured my digestion. And at last he
flung out in his violent way, and said with a D, ‘Then do as you like.’
Thank Goodness it will always be a consolation to me to know that I
instantly went out in a pouring rain and bought the things.”
“He paid for them, did he not?” asked Estella.
“It’s not the question, my dear child, who paid for them,”
returned Camilla, “I bought them. And I shall often think of that
with peace, when I wake up in the night.”
The ringing of a distant bell, combined with the echoing of some
cry or call along the passage by which I had come, interrupted the
conversation and caused Estella to say to me, “Now, boy!” On my
turning round, they all looked at me with the utmost contempt, and,
as I went out, I heard Sarah Pocket say, “Well I am sure! What next!”
and Camilla add, with indignation, “Was there ever such a fancy!
The i-de-a!”
As we were going with our candle along the dark passage, Estella
stopped all of a sudden, and, facing round, said in her taunting
manner with her face quite close to mine:
“Well?”
“Well, miss?” I answered, almost falling over her and checking
myself.
She stood looking at me, and, of course, I stood looking at her.
“Am I pretty?”
“Yes; I think you are very pretty.”
“Am I insulting?”
“Not so much so as you were last time,” said I.
74 Great Expectations
“Not so much so?”
“No.”
She fired when she asked the last question, and she slapped my
face with such force as she had, when I answered it.
“Now?” said she. “You little coarse monster, what do you think of
me now?”
“I shall not tell you.”
“Because you are going to tell, up-stairs. Is that it?”
“No,” said I, “that’s not it.”
“Why don’t you cry again, you little wretch?”
“Because I’ll never cry for you again,” said I. Which was, I suppose, as false a declaration as ever was made; for I was inwardly
crying for her then, and I know what I know of the pain she cost me
afterwards.
We went on our way up-stairs after this episode; and, as we were
going up, we met a gentleman groping his way down.
“Whom have we here?” asked the gentleman, stopping and looking at me.
“A boy,” said Estella.
He was a burly man of an exceedingly dark complexion, with an
exceedingly large head and a correspondingly large hand. He took
my chin in his large hand and turned up my face to have a look at me
by the light of the candle. He was prematurely bald on the top of his
head, and had bushy black eyebrows that wouldn’t lie down but
stood up bristling. His eyes were set very deep in his head, and were
disagreeably sharp and suspicious. He had a large watch-chain, and
strong black dots where his beard and whiskers would have been if
he had let them. He was nothing to me, and I could have had no
foresight then, that he ever would be anything to me, but it happened
that I had this opportunity of observing him well.
“Boy of the neighbourhood? Hey?” said he.
“Yes, sir,” said I.
“How do you come here?”
“Miss Havisham sent for me, sir,” I explained.
“Well! Behave yourself. I have a pretty large experience of
boys, and you’re a bad set of fellows. Now mind!” said he, biting
the side of his great forefinger as he frowned at me, “you behave
yourself !”
With those words, he released me––which I was glad of, for his
xi] Volume I Chapter XI 75
hand smelt of scented soap––and went his way down stairs. I wondered whether he could be a doctor; but no, I thought; he couldn’t be
a doctor, or he would have a quieter and more persuasive manner.
There was not much time to consider the subject, for we were soon
in Miss Havisham’s room, where she and everything else were just
as I had left them. Estella left me standing near the door, and I
stood there until Miss Havisham cast her eyes upon me from the
dressing-table.
“So!” she said, without being startled or surprised; “the days have
worn away, have they?”
“Yes, ma’am. To-day is––––”
“There, there, there!” with the impatient movement of her fingers.
“I don’t want to know. Are you ready to play?”
I was obliged to answer in some confusion, “I don’t think I am,
ma’am.”
“Not at cards again?” she demanded, with a searching look.
“Yes, ma’am; I could do that, if I was wanted.”
“Since this house strikes you old and grave, boy,” said Miss
Havisham, impatiently, “and you are unwilling to play, are you
willing to work?”
I could answer this inquiry with a better heart than I had been able
to find for the other question, and I said I was quite willing.
“Then go into that opposite room,” said she, pointing at the door
behind me with her withered hand, “and wait there till I come.”
I crossed the staircase landing, and entered the room she indicated. From that room, too, the daylight was completely excluded,
and it had an airless smell that was oppressive. A fire had been lately
kindled in the damp old-fashioned grate, and it was more disposed
to go out than to burn up, and the reluctant smoke which hung in the
room seemed colder than the clearer air––like our own marsh mist.
Certain wintry branches of candles on the high chimney-piece faintly
lighted the chamber: or, it would be more expressive to say, faintly
troubled its darkness. It was spacious, and I dare say had once been
handsome, but every discernible thing in it was covered with dust
and mould, and dropping to pieces. The most prominent object was
a long table with a tablecloth spread on it, as if a feast had been in
preparation when the house and the clocks all stopped together. An
epergne* or centre-piece of some kind was in the middle of this cloth;
it was so heavily overhung with cobwebs that its form was quite
76 Great Expectations
indistinguishable; and, as I looked along the yellow expanse out of
which I remember its seeming to grow, like a black fungus, I saw
speckled-legged spiders with blotchy bodies running home to it, and
running out from it, as if some circumstance of the greatest public
importance had just transpired in the spider community.
I heard the mice too, rattling behind the panels,* as if the same
occurrence were important to their interests. But, the black-beetles
took no notice of the agitation, and groped about the hearth in a
ponderous elderly way, as if they were short-sighted and hard of
hearing, and not on terms with one another.
These crawling things had fascinated my attention and I was
watching them from a distance, when Miss Havisham laid a hand
upon my shoulder. In her other hand she had a crutch-headed stick
on which she leaned, and she looked like the Witch of the place.
“This,” said she, pointing to the long table with her stick, “is where
I will be laid when I am dead. They shall come and look at me here.”
With some vague misgiving that she might get upon the table then
and there and die at once, the complete realisation of the ghastly
waxwork at the Fair, I shrank under her touch.
“What do you think that is?” she asked me, again pointing with
her stick; “that, where those cobwebs are?”
“I can’t guess what it is, ma’am.”
“It’s a great cake. A bride-cake. Mine!”
She looked all round the room in a glaring manner, and then said,
leaning on me while her hand twitched my shoulder, “Come, come,
come! Walk me, walk me!”
I made out from this, that the work I had to do, was to walk Miss
Havisham round and round the room. Accordingly, I started at once,
and she leaned upon my shoulder, and we went away at a pace that
might have been an imitation (founded on my first impulse under
that roof ) of Mr. Pumblechook’s chaise-cart.
She was not physically strong, and after a little time said, “Slower!”
Still, we went at an impatient fitful speed, and as we went, she
twitched the hand upon my shoulder, and worked her mouth, and
led me to believe that we were going fast because her thoughts went
fast. After a while she said, “Call Estella!” so I went out on the
landing and roared that name as I had done on the previous occasion.
When her light appeared, I returned to Miss Havisham, and we
started away again round and round the room.
xi] Volume I Chapter XI 77
If only Estella had come to be a spectator of our proceedings, I
should have felt sufficiently disconcerted; but, as she brought with
her the three ladies and the gentleman whom I had seen below, I
didn’t know what to do. In my politeness, I would have stopped; but
Miss Havisham twitched my shoulder, and we posted on*––with a
shame-faced consciousness on my part that they would think it was
all my doing.
“Dear Miss Havisham,” said Miss Sarah Pocket. “How well you
look!”
“I do not,” returned Miss Havisham. “I am yellow skin and
bone.”
Camilla brightened when Miss Pocket met with this rebuff; and
she murmured, as she plaintively contemplated Miss Havisham,
“Poor dear soul! Certainly not to be expected to look well, poor
thing. The idea!”
“And how are you?” said Miss Havisham to Camilla. As we were
close to Camilla then, I would have stopped as a matter of course,
only Miss Havisham wouldn’t stop. We swept on, and I felt that I
was highly obnoxious to Camilla.
“Thank you, Miss Havisham,” she returned, “I am as well as can
be expected.”
“Why, what’s the matter with you?” asked Miss Havisham, with
exceeding sharpness.
“Nothing worth mentioning,” replied Camilla. “I don’t wish to
make a display of my feelings, but I have habitually thought of you
more in the night than I am quite equal to.”
“Then don’t think of me,” retorted Miss Havisham.
“Very easily said!” remarked Camilla, amiably repressing a sob,
while a hitch came into her upper lip, and her tears overflowed.
“Raymond is a witness what ginger and sal volatile* I am obliged to
take in the night. Raymond is a witness what nervous jerkings I
have in my legs. Chokings and nervous jerkings, however, are
nothing new to me when I think with anxiety of those I love. If
I could be less affectionate and sensitive, I should have a better
digestion and an iron set of nerves. I am sure I wish it could be so.
But as to not thinking of you in the night––The idea!” Here, a burst
of tears.
The Raymond referred to, I understood to be the gentleman present, and him I understood to be Mr. Camilla. He came to the rescue
78 Great Expectations
at this point, and said in a consolatory and complimentary voice,
“Camilla, my dear, it is well known that your family feelings are
gradually undermining you to the extent of making one of your legs
shorter than the other.”
“I am not aware,” observed the grave lady whose voice I had heard
but once, “that to think of any person is to make a great claim upon
that person, my dear.”
Miss Sarah Pocket, whom I now saw to be a little dry brown
corrugated old woman, with a small face that might have been made
of walnut-shells, and a large mouth like a cat’s without the whiskers,
supported this position by saying, “No, indeed, my dear. Hem!”
“Thinking is easy enough,” said the grave lady.
“What is easier, you know?” assented Miss Sarah Pocket.
“Oh, yes, yes!” cried Camilla, whose fermenting feelings appeared
to rise from her legs to her bosom. “It’s all very true! It’s a weakness
to be so affectionate, but I can’t help it. No doubt my health would
be much better if it was otherwise, still I wouldn’t exchange my
disposition if I could. It’s the cause of much suffering, but it’s a
consolation to know I possess it, when I wake up in the night.” Here
another burst of feeling.
Miss Havisham and I had never stopped all this time, but kept
going round and round the room: now, brushing against the skirts of
the visitors: now, giving them the whole length of the dismal
chamber.
“There’s Matthew!” said Camilla. “Never mixing with any natural ties, never coming here to see how Miss Havisham is! I have
taken to the sofa with my staylace cut,* and have lain three hours,
insensible, with my head over the side, and my hair all down, and my
feet I don’t know where––––”
(“Much higher than your head, my love,” said Mr. Camilla.)
“I have gone off into that state, hours and hours, on account of
Matthew’s strange and inexplicable conduct, and nobody has
thanked me.”
“Really I must say I should think not!” interposed the grave lady.
“You see, my dear,” added Miss Sarah Pocket (a blandly vicious
personage), “the question to put to yourself is, who did you expect to
thank you, my love?”
“Without expecting any thanks, or anything of the sort,” resumed
Camilla, “I have remained in that state, hours and hours, and
xi] Volume I Chapter XI 79
Raymond is a witness of the extent to which I have choked, and what
the total inefficacy of ginger has been, and I have been heard at the
pianoforte-tuner’s across the street, where the poor mistaken children have even supposed it to be pigeons cooing at a distance––and
now to be told––––” Here Camilla put her hand to her throat, and
began to be quite chemical as to the formation of new combinations
there.
When this same Matthew was mentioned, Miss Havisham
stopped me and herself, and stood looking at the speaker. This
change had a great influence in bringing Camilla’s chemistry to a
sudden end.
“Matthew will come and see me at last,” said Miss Havisham,
sternly, “when I am laid on that table. That will be his place––there,”
striking the table with her stick, “at my head! And yours will be
there! And your husband’s there! And Sarah Pocket’s there! And
Georgiana’s there! Now you all know where to take your stations
when you come to feast upon me. And now go!”
At the mention of each name, she had struck the table with her
stick in a new place. She now said, “Walk me, walk me!” and we went
on again.
“I suppose there’s nothing to be done,” exclaimed Camilla, “but
comply and depart. It’s something to have seen the object of one’s
love and duty, for even so short a time. I shall think of it with a
melancholy satisfaction when I wake up in the night. I wish Matthew
could have that comfort, but he sets it at defiance. I am determined
not to make a display of my feelings, but it’s very hard to be told one
wants to feast on one’s relations––as if one was a Giant––and to be
told to go. The bare idea!”
Mr. Camilla interposing, as Mrs. Camilla laid her hand upon her
heaving bosom, that lady assumed an unnatural fortitude of manner
which I supposed to be expressive of an intention to drop and choke
when out of view, and kissing her hand to Miss Havisham, was
escorted forth. Sarah Pocket and Georgiana contended who should
remain last; but, Sarah was too knowing to be outdone, and ambled
round Georgiana with that artful slipperiness, that the latter was
obliged to take precedence. Sarah Pocket then made her separate
effect of departing with “Bless you, Miss Havisham dear!” and with
a smile of forgiving pity on her walnut-shell countenance for the
weaknesses of the rest.
80 Great Expectations
While Estella was away lighting them down, Miss Havisham still
walked with her hand on my shoulder, but more and more slowly. At
last she stopped before the fire, and said, after muttering and looking
at it some seconds:
“This is my birthday, Pip.”
I was going to wish her many happy returns, when she lifted her
stick.
“I don’t suffer it to be spoken of. I don’t suffer those who were
here just now, or any one, to speak of it. They come here on the day,
but they dare not refer to it.”
Of course I made no further effort to refer to it.
“On this day of the year, long before you were born, this heap of
decay,” stabbing with her crutched stick at the pile of cobwebs on the
table but not touching it, “was brought here. It and I have worn away
together. The mice have gnawed at it, and sharper teeth than teeth of
mice have gnawed at me.”*
She held the head of her stick against her heart as she stood
looking at the table; she in her once white dress, all yellow and
withered; the once white cloth all yellow and withered; everything
around, in a state to crumble under a touch.
“When the ruin is complete,” said she, with a ghastly look, “and
when they lay me dead, in my bride’s dress on the bride’s table––
which shall be done, and which will be the finished curse upon
him––so much the better if it is done on this day!”
She stood looking at the table as if she stood looking at her own
figure lying there. I remained quiet. Estella returned, and she too
remained quiet. It seemed to me that we continued thus for a long
time. In the heavy air of the room, and the heavy darkness that
brooded in its remoter corners, I even had an alarming fancy that
Estella and I might presently begin to decay.
At length, not coming out of her distraught state by degrees, but
in an instant, Miss Havisham said, “Let me see you two play cards;
why have you not begun?” With that, we returned to her room, and
sat down as before; I was beggared, as before; and again, as before,
Miss Havisham watched us all the time, directed my attention to
Estella’s beauty, and made me notice it the more by trying her jewels
on Estella’s breast and hair.
Estella, for her part, likewise treated me as before; except that she
did not condescend to speak. When we had played some half-dozen
xi] Volume I Chapter XI 81
games, a day was appointed for my return, and I was taken down into
the yard to be fed in the former dog-like manner. There, too, I was
again left to wander about as I liked.
It is not much to the purpose whether a gate in that garden wall
which I had scrambled up to peep over on the last occasion was, on
that last occasion, open or shut. Enough that I saw no gate then, and
that I saw one now. As it stood open, and as I knew that Estella had
let the visitors out––for, she had returned with the keys in her
hand––I strolled into the garden and strolled all over it. It was quite
a wilderness, and there were old melon-frames and cucumberframes in it, which seemed in their decline to have produced a spontaneous growth of weak attempts at pieces of old hats and boots, with
now and then a weedy offshoot into the likeness of a battered
saucepan.
When I had exhausted the garden, and a greenhouse with nothing
in it but a fallen-down grape-vine and some bottles, I found myself
in the dismal corner upon which I had looked out of the window.
Never questioning for a moment that the house was now empty, I
looked in at another window, and found myself, to my great surprise,
exchanging a broad stare with a pale young gentleman with red
eyelids and light hair.
This pale young gentleman quickly disappeared, and reappeared
beside me. He had been at his books when I had found myself staring
at him, and I now saw that he was inky.
“Halloa!” said he, “young fellow!”
Halloa being a general observation which I have usually observed
to be best answered by itself, I said “Halloa!” politely omitting young
fellow.
“Who let you in?” said he.
“Miss Estella.”
“Who gave you leave to prowl about?”
“Miss Estella.”
“Come and fight,” said the pale young gentleman.
What could I do but follow him? I have often asked myself the
question since: but, what else could I do? His manner was so final
and I was so astonished, that I followed where he led, as if I had been
under a spell.
“Stop a minute, though,” he said, wheeling round before we had
gone many paces. “I ought to give you a reason for fighting, too.
82 Great Expectations
There it is!” In a most irritating manner he instantly slapped his
hands against one another, daintily flung one of his legs up behind
him, pulled my hair, slapped his hands again, dipped his head, and
butted it into my stomach.
The bull-like proceeding last mentioned, besides that it was
unquestionably to be regarded in the light of a liberty, was particularly disagreeable just after bread and meat. I therefore hit out at him
and was going to hit out again, when he said, “Aha! Would you?” and
began dancing backwards and forwards in a manner quite unparalleled within my limited experience.
“Laws of the game!” said he. Here, he skipped from his left leg on
to his right. “Regular rules!”* Here, he skipped from his right leg on
to his left. “Come to the ground, and go through the preliminaries!”
Here, he dodged backwards and forwards, and did all sorts of things
while I looked helplessly at him.
I was secretly afraid of him when I saw him so dexterous; but, I
felt morally and physically convinced that his light head of hair
could have had no business in the pit of my stomach, and that I had a
right to consider it irrelevant when so obtruded on my attention.
Therefore, I followed him without a word, to a retired nook of the
garden, formed by the junction of two walls and screened by some
rubbish. On his asking me if I was satisfied with the ground, and on
my replying Yes, he begged my leave to absent himself for a moment,
and quickly returned with a bottle of water and a sponge dipped in
vinegar. “Available for both,” he said, placing these against the wall.
And then fell to pulling off, not only his jacket and waistcoat, but his
shirt too, in a manner at once light-hearted, businesslike, and
bloodthirsty.
Although he did not look very healthy––having pimples on his
face, and a breaking out at his mouth––these dreadful preparations
quite appalled me. I judged him to be about my own age, but he was
much taller, and he had a way of spinning himself about that was full
of appearance. For the rest, he was a young gentleman in a grey suit
(when not denuded for battle), with his elbows, knees, wrists, and
heels, considerably in advance of the rest of him as to development.
My heart failed me when I saw him squaring at me with every
demonstration of mechanical nicety, and eyeing my anatomy as if he
were minutely choosing his bone. I never have been so surprised in
my life, as I was when I let out the first blow, and saw him lying on
xi] Volume I Chapter XI 83
his back, looking at me with a bloody nose and his face exceedingly
fore-shortened.
But, he was on his feet directly, and after sponging himself with a
great show of dexterity began squaring again. The second greatest
surprise I have ever had in my life was seeing him on his back again,
looking up at me out of a black eye.
His spirit inspired me with great respect. He seemed to have no
strength, and he never once hit me hard, and he was always knocked
down; but, he would be up again in a moment, sponging himself or
drinking out of the water-bottle, with the greatest satisfaction in
seconding himself according to form, and then came at me with an
air and a show that made me believe he really was going to do for me
at last. He got heavily bruised, for I am sorry to record that the more
I hit him, the harder I hit him; but, he came up again and again and
again, until at last he got a bad fall with the back of his head against
the wall. Even after that crisis in our affairs, he got up and turned
round and round confusedly a few times, not knowing where I was;
but finally went on his knees to his sponge and threw it up: at the
same time panting out, “That means you have won.”
He seemed so brave and innocent, that although I had not proposed the contest I felt but a gloomy satisfaction in my victory.
Indeed, I go so far as to hope that I regarded myself while dressing,
as a species of savage young wolf, or other wild beast. However, I got
dressed, darkly wiping my sanguinary face at intervals, and I said,
“Can I help you?” and he said “No thankee,” and I said “Good
afternoon,” and he said “Same to you.”
When I got into the court-yard, I found Estella waiting with the
keys. But, she neither asked me where I had been, nor why I had kept
her waiting; and there was a bright flush upon her face, as though
something had happened to delight her. Instead of going straight to
the gate, too, she stepped back into the passage, and beckoned me.
“Come here! You may kiss me, if you like.”
I kissed her cheek as she turned it to me. I think I would have gone
through a great deal to kiss her cheek. But, I felt that the kiss was
given to the coarse common boy as a piece of money might have
been, and that it was worth nothing.
What with the birthday visitors, and what with the cards, and
what with the fight, my stay had lasted so long, that when I neared
home the light on the spit of sand off the point on the marshes was
84 Great Expectations
gleaming against a black night-sky, and Joe’s furnace was flinging a
path of fire across the road.
CHAPTER XII
My mind grew very uneasy on the subject of the pale young
gentleman. The more I thought of the fight, and recalled the pale
young gentleman on his back in various stages of puffy and incrimsoned countenance, the more certain it appeared that something
would be done to me. I felt that the pale young gentleman’s blood
was on my head, and that the Law would avenge it. Without having
any definite idea of the penalties I had incurred, it was clear to me
that village boys could not go stalking about the country, ravaging
the houses of gentlefolks and pitching into the studious youth of
England, without laying themselves open to severe punishment. For
some days, I even kept close at home, and looked out at the kitchen
door with the greatest caution and trepidation before going on an
errand, lest the officers of the County Jail should pounce upon me.
The pale young gentleman’s nose had stained my trousers, and I
tried to wash out that evidence of my guilt in the dead of night. I had
cut my knuckles against the pale young gentleman’s teeth, and I
twisted my imagination into a thousand tangles, as I devised incredible ways of accounting for that damnatory circumstance when I
should be haled before the Judges.
When the day came round for my return to the scene of the deed
of violence, my terrors reached their height. Whether myrmidons of
Justice,* specially sent down from London, would be lying in ambush
behind the gate? Whether Miss Havisham, preferring to take personal vengeance for an outrage done to her house, might rise in those
grave-clothes of hers, draw a pistol, and shoot me dead? Whether
suborned boys––a numerous band of mercenaries––might be
engaged to fall upon me in the brewery, and cuff me until I was no
more? It was high testimony to my confidence in the spirit of the pale
young gentleman, that I never imagined him accessary to these retaliations; they always came into my mind as the acts of injudicious
relatives of his, goaded on by the state of his visage and an indignant
sympathy with the family features.
However, go to Miss Havisham’s I must, and go I did. And
xii] Volume I Chapter XII 85
behold! nothing came of the late struggle. It was not alluded to in any
way, and no pale young gentleman was to be discovered on the premises. I found the same gate open, and I explored the garden, and even
looked in at the windows of the detached house; but, my view was
suddenly stopped by the closed shutters within, and all was lifeless.
Only in the corner where the combat had taken place, could I detect
any evidence of the young gentleman’s existence. There were traces
of his gore in that spot, and I covered them with garden-mould from
the eye of man.*
On the broad landing between Miss Havisham’s own room and
that other room in which the long table was laid out, I saw a gardenchair––a light chair on wheels, that you pushed from behind. It had
been placed there since my last visit, and I entered, that same day, on
a regular occupation of pushing Miss Havisham in this chair (when
she was tired of walking with her hand upon my shoulder) round her
own room, and across the landing, and round the other room. Over
and over and over again, we would make these journeys, and sometimes they would last as long as three hours at a stretch. I insensibly
fall into a general mention of these journeys as numerous, because it
was at once settled that I should return every alternate day at noon
for these purposes, and because I am now going to sum up a period
of at least eight or ten months.
As we began to be more used to one another, Miss Havisham
talked more to me, and asked me such questions as what had I learnt
and what was I going to be? I told her I was going to be apprenticed
to Joe, I believed; and I enlarged upon my knowing nothing and
wanting to know everything, in the hope that she might offer some
help towards that desirable end. But, she did not; on the contrary,
she seemed to prefer my being ignorant. Neither did she ever give
me any money––or anything but my daily dinner––nor even stipulate that I should be paid for my services.
Estella was always about, and always let me in and out, but never
told me I might kiss her again. Sometimes, she would coldly tolerate
me; sometimes, she would condescend to me; sometimes, she would
be quite familiar with me; sometimes, she would tell me energetically
that she hated me. Miss Havisham would often ask me in a whisper,
or when we were alone, “Does she grow prettier and prettier, Pip?”
And when I said yes (for indeed she did), would seem to enjoy it
greedily. Also, when we played at cards Miss Havisham would look
86 Great Expectations
on, with a miserly relish of Estella’s moods, whatever they were. And
sometimes, when her moods were so many and so contradictory of
one another that I was puzzled what to say or do, Miss Havisham
would embrace her with lavish fondness, murmuring something in
her ear that sounded like “Break their hearts my pride and hope,
break their hearts and have no mercy!”
There was a song Joe used to hum fragments of at the forge, of
which the burden was Old Clem.* This was not a very ceremonious
way of rendering homage to a patron saint; but, I believe Old Clem
stood in that relation towards smiths. It was a song that imitated the
measure of beating upon iron, and was a mere lyrical excuse for the
introduction of Old Clem’s respected name. Thus, you were to
hammer boys round––Old Clem! With a thump and a sound––Old
Clem! Beat it out, beat it out––Old Clem! With a clink for the
stout––Old Clem! Blow the fire, blow the fire––Old Clem! Roaring
dryer, soaring higher––Old Clem! One day soon after the appearance
of the chair, Miss Havisham suddenly saying to me, with the
impatient movement of her fingers, “There, there, there! Sing!” I
was surprised into crooning this ditty as I pushed her over the floor.
It happened so to catch her fancy that, she took it up in a low
brooding voice as if she were singing in her sleep. After that, it
became customary with us to have it as we moved about, and Estella
would often join in; though the whole strain was so subdued, even
when there were three of us, that it made less noise in the grim old
house than the lightest breath of wind.
What could I become with these surroundings? How could my
character fail to be influenced by them? Is it to be wondered at if my
thoughts were dazed, as my eyes were, when I came out into the
natural light from the misty yellow rooms?
Perhaps, I might have told Joe about the pale young gentleman, if
I had not previously been betrayed into those enormous inventions
to which I had confessed. Under the circumstances, I felt that Joe
could hardly fail to discern in the pale young gentleman, an
appropriate passenger to be put into the black velvet coach; therefore, I said nothing of him. Besides: that shrinking from having Miss
Havisham and Estella discussed, which had come upon me in the
beginning, grew much more potent as time went on. I reposed complete confidence in no one but Biddy; but, I told poor Biddy everything. Why it came natural to me to do so, and why Biddy had a deep
xii] Volume I Chapter XII 87
concern in everything I told her, I did not know then, though I think
I know now.
Meanwhile, councils went on in the kitchen at home, fraught with
almost insupportable aggravation to my exasperated spirit. That ass,
Pumblechook, used often to come over of a night for the purpose of
discussing my prospects with my sister; and I really do believe (to
this hour with less penitence than I ought to feel), that if these hands
could have taken a linchpin out of his chaise-cart, they would have
done it. The miserable man was a man of that confined stolidity of
mind, that he could not discuss my prospects without having me
before him––as it were, to operate upon––and he would drag me up
from my stool (usually by the collar) where I was quiet in a corner,
and, putting me before the fire as if I were going to be cooked, would
begin by saying, “Now, Mum, here is this boy! Here is this boy
which you brought up by hand. Hold up your head, boy, and be for
ever grateful unto them which so did do. Now, Mum, with respections to this boy!” And then he would rumple my hair the wrong
way––which from my earliest remembrance, as already hinted, I
have in my soul denied the right of any fellow-creature to do––and
would hold me before him by the sleeve: a spectacle of imbecility
only to be equalled by himself.
Then, he and my sister would pair off in such nonsensical speculations about Miss Havisham, and about what she would do with me
and for me, that I used to want––quite painfully––to burst into
spiteful tears, fly at Pumblechook, and pummel him all over. In these
dialogues, my sister spoke of me as if she were morally wrenching
one of my teeth out at every reference; while Pumblechook himself,
self-constituted my patron, would sit supervising me with a depreciatory eye, like the architect of my fortunes who thought himself
engaged on a very unremunerative job.
In these discussions, Joe bore no part. But he was often talked at,
while they were in progress, by reason of Mrs. Joe’s perceiving that
he was not favourable to my being taken from the forge. I was fully
old enough now, to be apprenticed to Joe; and when Joe sat with the
poker on his knees thoughtfully raking out the ashes between the
lower bars, my sister would so distinctly construe that innocent
action into opposition on his part, that she would dive at him, take
the poker out of his hands, shake him, and put it away. There was a
most irritating end to every one of these debates. All in a moment,
88 Great Expectations
with nothing to lead up to it, my sister would stop herself in a yawn,
and catching sight of me as it were incidentally, would swoop upon
me with, “Come! There’s enough of you! You get along to bed;
you’ve given trouble enough for one night, I hope!” As if I had
besought them as a favour to bother my life out.
We went on in this way for a long time, and it seemed likely that
we should continue to go on in this way for a long time, when, one
day Miss Havisham stopped short as she and I were walking, she
leaning on my shoulder; and said with some displeasure:
“You are growing tall, Pip!”
I thought it best to hint, through the medium of a meditative look,
that this might be occasioned by circumstances over which I had no
control.
She said no more at the time; but, she presently stopped and
looked at me again; and presently again; and after that, looked
frowning and moody. On the next day of my attendance when our
usual exercise was over, and I had landed her at her dressing-table,
she stayed me with a movement of her impatient fingers:
“Tell me the name again of that blacksmith of yours.”
“Joe Gargery, ma’am.”
“Meaning the master you were to be apprenticed to?”
“Yes, Miss Havisham.”
“You had better be apprenticed at once. Would Gargery come
here with you, and bring your indentures, do you think?”
I signified that I had no doubt he would take it as an honour to be
asked.
“Then let him come.”
“At any particular time, Miss Havisham?”
“There, there! I know nothing about times. Let him come soon,
and come alone with you.”
When I got home at night, and delivered this message for Joe, my
sister “went on the Rampage,” in a more alarming degree than at any
previous period. She asked me and Joe whether we supposed she was
door-mats under our feet, and how we dared to use her so, and what
company we graciously thought she was fit for? When she had
exhausted a torrent of such inquiries, she threw a candlestick at Joe,
burst into a loud sobbing, got out the dustpan––which was always
a very bad sign––put on her coarse apron, and began cleaning up to
a terrible extent. Not satisfied with a dry cleaning, she took to a
xii] Volume I Chapter XII 89
pail and scrubbing-brush, and cleaned us out of house and home, so
that we stood shivering in the back yard. It was ten o’clock at night
before we ventured to creep in again, and then she asked Joe why he
hadn’t married a Negress Slave* at once? Joe offered no answer, poor
fellow, but stood feeling his whisker and looking dejectedly at me, as
if he thought it really might have been a better speculation.
CHAPTER XIII
It was a trial to my feelings, on the next day but one, to see Joe
arraying himself in his Sunday clothes to accompany me to Miss
Havisham’s. However, as he thought his court-suit* necessary to the
occasion, it was not for me to tell him that he looked far better
in his working dress; the rather, because I knew he made himself
so dreadfully uncomfortable, entirely on my account, and that it
was for me he pulled up his shirt-collar so very high behind, that
it made the hair on the crown of his head stand up like a tuft of
feathers.
At breakfast-time my sister declared her intention of going to
town with us, and being left at Uncle Pumblechook’s, and called for
“when we had done with our fine ladies”––a way of putting the case,
from which Joe appeared inclined to augur the worst. The forge was
shut up for the day, and Joe inscribed in chalk upon the door (as it
was his custom to do on the very rare occasions when he was not at
work) the monosyllable hout, accompanied by a sketch of an arrow
supposed to be flying in the direction he had taken.
We walked to town, my sister leading the way in a very large
beaver bonnet,* and carrying a basket like the Great Seal of England*
in plaited straw, a pair of pattens,* a spare shawl, and an umbrella,
though it was a fine bright day. I am not quite clear whether these
articles were carried penitentially or ostentatiously; but, I rather
think they were displayed as articles of property––much as Cleopatra or any other sovereign lady on the Rampage might exhibit her
wealth in a pageant or procession.*
When we came to Pumblechook’s, my sister bounced in and left
us. As it was almost noon, Joe and I held straight on to Miss Havisham’s house. Estella opened the gate as usual, and, the moment she
appeared, Joe took his hat off and stood weighing it by the brim in
90 Great Expectations
both his hands: as if he had some urgent reason in his mind for being
particular to half a quarter of an ounce.
Estella took no notice of either of us, but led us the way that I
knew so well. I followed next to her, and Joe came last. When I
looked back at Joe in the long passage, he was still weighing his hat
with the greatest care, and was coming after us in long strides on the
tips of his toes.
Estella told me we were both to go in, so I took Joe by the coatcuff and conducted him into Miss Havisham’s presence. She was
seated at her dressing-table, and looked round at us immediately.
“Oh!” said she to Joe. “You are the husband of the sister of this boy?”
I could hardly have imagined dear old Joe looking so unlike himself or so like some extraordinary bird; standing, as he did, speechless, with his tuft of feathers ruffled, and his mouth open, as if he
wanted a worm.
“You are the husband,” repeated Miss Havisham, “of the sister
of this boy?”
It was very aggravating; but, throughout the interview Joe persisted in addressing Me instead of Miss Havisham.
“Which I meantersay, Pip,” Joe now observed in a manner that was
at once expressive of forcible argumentation, strict confidence, and
great politeness, “as I hup and married your sister, and I were at the
time what you might call (if you was anyways inclined) a single man.”
“Well!” said Miss Havisham. “And you have reared the boy, with
the intention of taking him for your apprentice; is that so, Mr.
Gargery?”
“You know, Pip,” replied Joe, “as you and me were ever friends,
and it were look’d for’ard to betwixt us, as being calc’lated to lead to
larks. Not but what, Pip, if you had ever made objections to the
business––such as its being open to black and sut, or such-like––not
but what they would have been attended to, don’t you see?”
“Has the boy,” said Miss Havisham, “ever made any objection?
Does he like the trade?”
“Which it is well beknown to yourself, Pip,” returned Joe,
strengthening his former mixture of argumentation, confidence, and
politeness, “that it were the wish of your own hart.” (I saw the idea
suddenly break upon him that he would adapt his epitaph to the
occasion, before he went on to say) “And there weren’t no objection
on your part, and Pip it were the great wish of your hart!”
xiii] Volume I Chapter XIII 91
It was quite in vain for me to endeavour to make him sensible that
he ought to speak to Miss Havisham. The more I made faces and
gestures to him to do it, the more confidential, argumentative, and
polite, he persisted in being to Me.
“Have you brought his indentures with you?” asked Miss
Havisham.
“Well, Pip, you know,” replied Joe, as if that were a little
unreasonable, “you yourself see me put ’em in my ’at, and therefore
you know as they are here.” With which he took them out, and gave
them, not to Miss Havisham, but to me. I am afraid I was ashamed of
the dear good fellow––I know I was ashamed of him––when I saw
that Estella stood at the back of Miss Havisham’s chair, and that her
eyes laughed mischievously. I took the indentures out of his hand
and gave them to Miss Havisham.
“You expected,” said Miss Havisham, as she looked them over,
“no premium with the boy?”
“Joe!” I remonstrated; for he made no reply at all. “Why don’t you
answer––––”
“Pip,” returned Joe, cutting me short, as if he were hurt, “which I
meantersay that were not a question requiring a answer betwixt
yourself and me, and which you know the answer to be full well No.
You know it to be No, Pip, and wherefore should I say it?”
Miss Havisham glanced at him as if she understood what he really
was, better than I had thought possible, seeing what he was there;
and took up a little bag from the table beside her.
“Pip has earned a premium here,” she said, “and here it is. There
are five-and-twenty guineas in this bag. Give it to your master,
Pip?”
As if he were absolutely out of his mind with the wonder
awakened in him by her strange figure and the strange room, Joe,
even at this pass, persisted in addressing me.
“This is wery liberal on your part, Pip,” said Joe, “and it is as such
received and grateful welcome, though never looked for, far nor near
nor nowheres. And now, old chap,” said Joe, conveying to me a
sensation, first of burning and then of freezing, for I felt as if that
familiar expression were applied to Miss Havisham; “and now, old
chap, may we do our duty! May you and me do our duty, both on us
by one and another, and by them which your liberal present––have––
conweyed––to be––for the satisfaction of mind––of––them as
92 Great Expectations
never––” here Joe showed that he felt he had fallen into frightful
difficulties, until he triumphantly rescued himself with the words,
“and from myself far be it!” These words had such a round and
convincing sound for him that he said them twice.
“Good-by, Pip!” said Miss Havisham. “Let them out, Estella.”
“Am I to come again, Miss Havisham?” I asked.
“No. Gargery is your master now. Gargery! One word!”
Thus calling him back as I went out of the door, I heard her say to
Joe in a distinct emphatic voice, “The boy has been a good boy here,
and that is his reward. Of course, as an honest man, you will expect
no other and no more.”
How Joe got out of the room, I have never been able to determine;
but, I know that when he did get out he was steadily proceeding upstairs instead of coming down, and was deaf to all remonstrances
until I went after him and laid hold of him. In another minute we
were outside the gate, and it was locked, and Estella was gone.
When we stood in the daylight alone again, Joe backed up against
a wall, and said to me, “Astonishing!” And there he remained so
long, saying “Astonishing!” at intervals, so often, that I began to
think his senses were never coming back. At length he prolonged his
remark into “Pip, I do assure you this is as-ton-ishing!” and so, by
degrees, became conversational and able to walk away.
I have reason to think that Joe’s intellects were brightened by the
encounter they had passed through, and that on our way to Pumblechook’s he invented a subtle and deep design. My reason is to be
found in what took place in Mr. Pumblechook’s parlour: where, on
our presenting ourselves, my sister sat in conference with that
detested seedsman.
“Well?” cried my sister, addressing us both at once. “And what’s
happened to you? I wonder you condescend to come back to such
poor society as this, I am sure I do!”
“Miss Havisham,” said Joe, with a fixed look at me, like an effort
of remembrance, “made it wery partick’ler that we should give her––
were it compliments or respects, Pip?”
“Compliments,” I said.
“Which that were my own belief,” assented Joe––“her compliments to Mrs. J. Gargery––––”
“Much good they’ll do me!” observed my sister; but rather
gratified too.
xiii] Volume I Chapter XIII 93
“And wishing,” pursued Joe, with another fixed look at me, like
another effort of remembrance, “that the state of Miss Havisham’s
elth were sitch as would have––allowed, were it, Pip?”
“Of her having the pleasure,” I added.
“Of ladies’ company,” said Joe. And drew a long breath.
“Well!” cried my sister, with a mollified glance at Mr. Pumblechook. “She might have had the politeness to send that message at
first, but it’s better late than never. And what did she give young
Rantipole* here?”
“She giv’ him,” said Joe, “nothing.”
Mrs. Joe was going to break out, but Joe went on.
“What she giv’,” said Joe, “she giv’ to his friends. ‘And by his
friends,’ were her explanation, ‘I mean into the hands of his sister
Mrs. J. Gargery.’ Them were her words; ‘Mrs. J. Gargery.’ She
mayn’t have know’d,” added Joe, with an appearance of reflection,
“whether it were Joe, or Jorge.”
My sister looked at Pumblechook: who smoothed the elbows of
his wooden arm-chair, and nodded at her and at the fire, as if he had
known all about it beforehand.
“And how much have you got?” asked my sister, laughing. Positively, laughing!
“What would present company say to ten pound?” demanded Joe.
“They’d say,” returned my sister, curtly, “pretty well. Not too
much, but pretty well.”
“It’s more than that, then,” said Joe.
That fearful Impostor, Pumblechook, immediately nodded, and
said, as he rubbed the arms of his chair: “It’s more than that, Mum.”
“Why you don’t mean to say––––” began my sister.
“Yes I do, Mum,” said Pumblechook; “but wait a bit. Go on,
Joseph. Good in you! Go on!”
“What would present company say,” proceeded Joe, “to twenty
pound?”
“Handsome would be the word,” returned my sister.
“Well, then,” said Joe, “it’s more than twenty pound.”
That abject hypocrite, Pumblechook, nodded again, and said, with
a patronising laugh, “It’s more than that, Mum. Good again! Follow
her up, Joseph!”
“Then to make an end of it,” said Joe, delightedly handing the bag
to my sister; “it’s five-and-twenty pound.”
94 Great Expectations
“It’s five-and-twenty pound, Mum,” echoed that basest of swindlers, Pumblechook, rising to shake hands with her; “and it’s no more
than your merits (as I said when my opinion was asked) and I wish
you joy of the money!”
If the villain had stopped here, his case would have been sufficiently awful, but he blackened his guilt by proceeding to take me
into custody, with a right of patronage that left all his former criminality far behind.
“Now you see, Joseph and wife,” said Pumblechook, as he took me
by the arm above the elbow, “I am one of them that always go right
through with what they’ve begun. This boy must be bound, out of
hand. That’s my way. Bound out of hand.”
“Goodness knows, Uncle Pumblechook,” said my sister (grasping
the money), “we’re deeply beholden to you.”
“Never mind me, Mum,” returned that diabolical corn-chandler.
“A pleasure’s a pleasure, all the world over. But this boy, you know;
we must have him bound. I said I’d see to it––to tell you the truth.”
The Justices were sitting in the Town Hall near at hand, and we at
once went over to have me bound apprentice to Joe in the Magisterial
presence. I say, we went over, but I was pushed over by Pumblechook, exactly as if I had that moment picked a pocket or fired a rick;
indeed, it was the general impression in Court that I had been taken
red-handed, for, as Pumblechook shoved me before him through the
crowd, I heard some people say, “What’s he done?” and others,
“He’s a young ’un, too, but looks bad, don’t he?” One person of mild
and benevolent aspect even gave me a tract ornamented with a woodcut of a malevolent young man fitted up with a perfect sausage-shop
of fetters, and entitled To be read in my Cell.
The Hall was a queer place, I thought, with higher pews in it than
a church––and with people hanging over the pews looking on––and
with mighty Justices (one with a powdered head) leaning back
in chairs, with folded arms, or taking snuff, or going to sleep, or
writing, or reading the newspapers––and with some shining black
portraits on the walls, which my unartistic eye regarded as a composition of hardbake* and sticking-plaister. Here, in a corner, my
indentures were duly signed and attested, and I was “bound;” Mr.
Pumblechook holding me all the while as if we had looked in on our
way to the scaffold, to have those little preliminaries disposed of.
When we had come out again, and had got rid of the boys who had
xiii] Volume I Chapter XIII 95
been put into great spirits by the expectation of seeing me publicly
tortured, and who were much disappointed to find that my friends
were merely rallying round me, we went back to Pumblechook’s.
And there my sister became so excited by the twenty-five guineas,
that nothing would serve her but we must have a dinner out of that
windfall, at the Blue Boar, and that Pumblechook must go over in his
chaise-cart, and bring the Hubbles and Mr. Wopsle.
It was agreed to be done; and a most melancholy day I passed. For,
it inscrutably appeared to stand to reason, in the minds of the whole
company, that I was an excrescence on the entertainment. And to
make it worse, they all asked me from time to time––in short, whenever they had nothing else to do––why I didn’t enjoy myself. And
what could I possibly do then, but say I was enjoying myself––when I
wasn’t?
However, they were grown up and had their own way, and they
made the most of it. That swindling Pumblechook, exalted into the
beneficent contriver of the whole occasion, actually took the top of
the table; and, when he addressed them on the subject of my being
bound, and fiendishly congratulated them on my being liable to
imprisonment if I played at cards, drank strong liquors, kept late
hours or bad company, or indulged in other vagaries which the form
of my indentures appeared to contemplate as next to inevitable, he
placed me standing on a chair beside him, to illustrate his remarks.
My only other remembrances of the great festival are, That they
wouldn’t let me go to sleep, but whenever they saw me dropping off,
woke me up and told me to enjoy myself. That, rather late in the
evening Mr. Wopsle gave us Collins’s ode,* and threw his bloodstain’d sword in thunder down, with such effect, that a waiter came
in and said, “The Commercials* underneath sent up their compliments, and it wasn’t the Tumbler’s Arms.” That, they were all in
excellent spirits on the road home, and sang O Lady Fair!* Mr.
Wopsle taking the bass, and asserting with a tremendously strong
voice (in reply to the inquisitive bore who leads that piece of music in
a most impertinent manner, by wanting to know all about everybody’s private affairs) that he was the man with his white locks
flowing, and that he was upon the whole the weakest pilgrim going.
Finally, I remember that when I got into my little bedroom I was
truly wretched, and had a strong conviction on me that I should
never like Joe’s trade. I had liked it once, but once was not now.
96 Great Expectations
CHAPTER XIV
It is a most miserable thing to feel ashamed of home. There may be
black ingratitude in the thing, and the punishment may be retributive and well deserved; but, that it is a miserable thing, I can testify.
Home had never been a very pleasant place to me, because of my
sister’s temper. But, Joe had sanctified it, and I had believed in it. I
had believed in the best parlour as a most elegant saloon; I had
believed in the front door, as a mysterious portal of the Temple of
State whose solemn opening was attended with a sacrifice of roast
fowls; I had believed in the kitchen as a chaste though not magnificent apartment; I had believed in the forge as the glowing road to
manhood and independence. Within a single year, all this was
changed. Now, it was all coarse and common, and I would not have
had Miss Havisham and Estella see it on any account.
How much of my ungracious condition of mind may have been
my own fault, how much Miss Havisham’s, how much my sister’s, is
now of no moment to me or to any one. The change was made in me;
the thing was done. Well or ill done, excusably or inexcusably, it was
done.
Once, it had seemed to me that when I should at last roll up my
shirt-sleeves and go into the forge, Joe’s ’prentice, I should be distinguished and happy. Now the reality was in my hold, I only felt
that I was dusty with the dust of small-coal,* and that I had a weight
upon my daily remembrance to which the anvil was a feather. There
have been occasions in my later life (I suppose as in most lives) when
I have felt for a time as if a thick curtain had fallen on all its interest
and romance, to shut me out from anything save dull endurance any
more. Never has that curtain dropped so heavy and blank, as when
my way in life lay stretched out straight before me through the
newly-entered road of apprenticeship to Joe.
I remember that at a later period of my “time,” I used to stand
about the churchyard on Sunday evenings when night was falling,
comparing my own perspective with the windy marsh view, and
making out some likeness between them by thinking how flat and low
both were, and how on both there came an unknown way and a dark
mist and then the sea. I was quite as dejected on the first workingday of my apprenticeship as in that after-time; but I am glad to know
xiv] Volume I Chapter XIV 97
that I never breathed a murmur to Joe while my indentures lasted. It
is about the only thing I am glad to know of myself in that
connexion.
For, though it includes what I proceed to add, all the merit of what
I proceed to add was Joe’s. It was not because I was faithful, but
because Joe was faithful, that I never ran away and went for a soldier
or a sailor. It was not because I had a strong sense of the virtue of
industry, but because Joe had a strong sense of the virtue of industry,
that I worked with tolerable zeal against the grain. It is not possible
to know how far the influence of any amiable honest-hearted dutydoing man flies out into the world; but it is very possible to know
how it has touched one’s self in going by, and I know right well, that
any good that intermixed itself with my apprenticeship came of plain
contented Joe, and not of restlessly aspiring discontented me.
What I wanted, who can say? How can I say, when I never knew?
What I dreaded was, that in some unlucky hour I, being at my
grimiest and commonest, should lift up my eyes and see Estella
looking in at one of the wooden windows of the forge. I was haunted
by the fear that she would, sooner or later, find me out, with a black
face and hands, doing the coarsest part of my work, and would exult
over me and despise me. Often after dark, when I was pulling the
bellows for Joe, and we were singing Old Clem, and when the
thought how we used to sing it at Miss Havisham’s would seem to
show me Estella’s face in the fire, with her pretty hair fluttering in
the wind and her eyes scorning me,––often at such a time I would
look towards those panels of black night* in the wall which the
wooden windows then were, and would fancy that I saw her just
drawing her face away, and would believe that she had come at last.
After that, when we went in to supper, the place and the meal
would have a more homely look than ever, and I would feel more
ashamed of home than ever, in my own ungracious breast.
CHAPTER XV
As I was getting too big for Mr. Wopsle’s great-aunt’s room, my
education under that preposterous female terminated. Not, however,
until Biddy had imparted to me everything she knew, from the little
catalogue of prices, to a comic song* she had once bought for a
98 Great Expectations
halfpenny. Although the only coherent part of the latter piece of
literature were the opening lines,
When I went to Lunnon town sirs,
Too rul loo rul
Too rul loo rul
Wasn’t I done very brown sirs,*
Too rul loo rul
Too rul loo rul
––still, in my desire to be wiser, I got this composition by heart with
the utmost gravity; nor do I recollect that I questioned its merit,
except that I thought (as I still do) the amount of Too rul somewhat
in excess of the poetry. In my hunger for information, I made proposals to Mr. Wopsle to bestow some intellectual crumbs upon me:
with which he kindly complied. As it turned out, however, that he
only wanted me for a dramatic lay-figure, to be contradicted and
embraced and wept over and bullied and clutched and stabbed and
knocked about in a variety of ways, I soon declined that course of
instruction; though not until Mr. Wopsle in his poetic fury had
severely mauled me.
Whatever I acquired, I tried to impart to Joe. This statement
sounds so well, that I cannot in my conscience let it pass unexplained.
I wanted to make Joe less ignorant and common, that he might be
worthier of my society and less open to Estella’s reproach.
The old Battery out on the marshes was our place of study, and a
broken slate and a short piece of slate pencil were our educational
implements: to which Joe always added a pipe of tobacco. I never
knew Joe to remember anything from one Sunday to another, or to
acquire, under my tuition, any piece of information whatever. Yet he
would smoke his pipe at the Battery with a far more sagacious air
than anywhere else––even with a learned air––as if he considered
himself to be advancing immensely. Dear fellow, I hope he did.
It was pleasant and quiet, out there with the sails on the river
passing beyond the earthwork, and sometimes, when the tide was
low, looking as if they belonged to sunken ships that were still sailing
on at the bottom of the water. Whenever I watched the vessels standing out to sea with their white sails spread, I somehow thought of
Miss Havisham and Estella; and whenever the light struck aslant,
afar off, upon a cloud or sail or green hill-side or water-line, it was
xv] Volume I Chapter XV 99
just the same.––Miss Havisham and Estella and the strange house
and the strange life appeared to have something to do with everything that was picturesque.
One Sunday when Joe, greatly enjoying his pipe, had so plumed
himself on being “most awful dull,” that I had given him up for the
day, I lay on the earthwork for some time with my chin on my hand,
descrying traces of Miss Havisham and Estella all over the prospect,
in the sky and in the water, until at last I resolved to mention a
thought concerning them that had been much in my head.
“Joe,” said I; “don’t you think I ought to make Miss Havisham a
visit?”
“Well, Pip,” returned Joe, slowly considering. “What for?”
“What for, Joe? What is any visit made for?”
“There is some wisits p’r’aps,” said Joe, “as for ever remains open
to the question, Pip. But in regard of wisiting Miss Havisham. She
might think you wanted something––expected something of her.”
“Don’t you think I might say that I did not, Joe?”
“You might, old chap,” said Joe. “And she might credit it. Similarly she mightn’t.”
Joe felt, as I did, that he had made a point there, and he pulled
hard at his pipe to keep himself from weakening it by repetition.
“You see, Pip,” Joe pursued, as soon as he was past that danger,
“Miss Havisham done the handsome thing by you. When Miss Havisham done the handsome thing by you, she called me back to say to
me as that were all.”
“Yes, Joe. I heard her.”
“All,” Joe repeated, very emphatically.
“Yes, Joe, I tell you, I heard her.”
“Which I meantersay, Pip, it might be that her meaning were––
Make a end on it!––As you was!––Me to the North, and you to the
South!––Keep in sunders!”*
I had thought of that too, and it was very far from comforting to
me to find that he had thought of it; for it seemed to render it more
probable.
“But, Joe.”
“Yes, old chap.”
“Here am I, getting on in the first year of my time, and, since the
day of my being bound, I have never thanked Miss Havisham, or
asked after her, or shown that I remember her.”
100 Great Expectations
“That’s true, Pip; and unless you was to turn her out a set of shoes
all four round––and which I meantersay as even a set of shoes all
four round might not act acceptable as a present, in a total wacancy
of hoofs––––”
“I don’t mean that sort of remembrance, Joe; I don’t mean a
present.”
But Joe had got the idea of a present in his head and must harp
upon it. “Or even,” said he, “if you was helped to knocking her up a
new chain for the front door––or say a gross or two of shark-headed*
screws for general use––or some light fancy article, such as a
toasting-fork when she took her muffins––or a gridiron when she
took a sprat or such like––––”
“I don’t mean any present at all, Joe,” I interposed.
“Well,” said Joe, still harping on it as though I had particularly
pressed it, “if I was yourself, Pip, I wouldn’t. No, I would not. For
what’s a door-chain when she’s got one always up? And sharkheaders is open to misrepresentations. And if it was a toasting-fork,
you’d go into brass and do yourself no credit. And the oncommonest
workman can’t show himself oncommon in a gridiron––for a gridiron is a gridiron,” said Joe, steadfastly impressing it upon me, as if
he were endeavouring to rouse me from a fixed delusion, “and you
may haim at what you like, but a gridiron it will come out, either by
your leave or again your leave, and you can’t help yourself––––”
“My dear Joe,” I cried, in desperation, taking hold of his coat,
“don’t go on in that way. I never thought of making Miss Havisham
any present.”
“No, Pip,” Joe assented, as if he had been contending for that, all
along; “and what I say to you is, you are right, Pip.”
“Yes, Joe; but what I wanted to say, was, that as we are rather slack
just now, if you would give me a half-holiday to-morrow, I think I
would go up-town and make a call on Miss Est––Havisham.”
“Which her name,” said Joe, gravely, “ain’t Estavisham, Pip,
unless she have been rechris’ened.”
“I know, Joe, I know. It was a slip of mine. What do you think of it,
Joe?”
In brief, Joe thought that if I thought well of it, he thought well of
it. But, he was particular in stipulating that if I were not received
with cordiality, or if I were not encouraged to repeat my visit as a
visit which had no ulterior object but was simply one of gratitude for
xv] Volume I Chapter XV 101
a favour received, then this experimental trip should have no successor. By these conditions I promised to abide.
Now, Joe kept a journeyman* at weekly wages whose name was
Orlick. He pretended that his christian name was Dolge––a clear
impossibility––but he was a fellow of that obstinate disposition that
I believe him to have been the prey of no delusion in this particular,
but wilfully to have imposed that name upon the village as an
affront to its understanding. He was a broad-shouldered looselimbed swarthy fellow of great strength, never in a hurry, and
always slouching. He never even seemed to come to his work on
purpose, but would slouch in as if by mere accident; and when he
went to the Jolly Bargemen to eat his dinner, or went away at night,
he would slouch out, like Cain or the Wandering Jew,* as if he had
no idea where he was going and no intention of ever coming back.
He lodged at a sluice-keeper’s out on the marshes, and on working
days would come slouching from his hermitage, with his hands in
his pockets and his dinner loosely tied in a bundle round his neck
and dangling on his back. On Sundays he mostly lay all day on
sluice-gates, or stood against ricks and barns. He always slouched,
locomotively, with his eyes on the ground; and, when accosted or
otherwise required to raise them, he looked up in a half resentful,
half puzzled way, as though the only thought he ever had, was, that
it was rather an odd and injurious fact that he should never be
thinking.
This morose journeyman had no liking for me. When I was very
small and timid, he gave me to understand that the Devil lived in a
black corner of the forge, and that he knew the fiend very well: also
that it was necessary to make up the fire, once in seven years, with a
live boy, and that I might consider myself fuel. When I became Joe’s
’prentice, Orlick was perhaps confirmed in some suspicion that I
should displace him; howbeit, he liked me still less. Not that he ever
said anything, or did anything openly importing hostility; I only
noticed that he always beat his sparks in my direction, and that
whenever I sang Old Clem, he came in out of time.
Dolge Orlick was at work and present, next day, when I reminded
Joe of my half-holiday. He said nothing at the moment, for he and
Joe had just got a piece of hot iron between them, and I was at the
bellows; but by-and-by he said, leaning on his hammer:
“Now, master! Sure you’re not a going to favour only one of us. If
102 Great Expectations
Young Pip has a half-holiday, do as much for Old Orlick.” I suppose
he was about five-and-twenty, but he usually spoke of himself as an
ancient person.
“Why, what’ll you do with a half-holiday, if you get it?” said Joe.
“What’ll I do with it! What’ll he do with it? I’ll do as much with it
as him,” said Orlick.
“As to Pip, he’s going up-town,” said Joe.
“Well then, as to Old Orlick, he’s a going up-town,” retorted that
worthy. “Two can go up-town. Tan’t only one wot can go up-town.”
“Don’t lose your temper,” said Joe.
“Shall if I like,” growled Orlick. “Some and their up-towning!
Now, master! Come. No favouring in this shop. Be a man!”
The master refusing to entertain the subject until the journeyman
was in a better temper, Orlick plunged at the furnace, drew out a
red-hot bar, made at me with it as if he were going to run it through
my body, whisked it round my head, laid it on the anvil, hammered it
out––as if it were I, I thought, and the sparks were my spirting
blood––and finally said, when he had hammered himself hot and the
iron cold, and he again leaned on his hammer:
“Now, master!”
“Are you all right now?” demanded Joe.
“Ah! I am all right,” said gruff Old Orlick.
“Then, as in general you stick to your work as well as most men,”
said Joe, “let it be a half-holiday for all.”
My sister had been standing silent in the yard, within hearing––
she was a most unscrupulous spy and listener––and she instantly
looked in at one of the windows.
“Like you, you fool!” said she to Joe, “giving holidays to great idle
hulkers like that. You are a rich man, upon my life, to waste wages in
that way. I wish I was his master!”
“You’d be everybody’s master, if you durst,” retorted Orlick, with
an ill-favoured grin.
(“Let her alone,” said Joe.)
“I’d be a match for all noodles* and all rogues,” returned my sister,
beginning to work herself into a mighty rage. “And I couldn’t be a
match for the noodles, without being a match for your master, who’s
the dunder-headed king of the noodles. And I couldn’t be a match
for the rogues, without being a match for you, who are the blackestlooking and the worst rogue between this and France. Now!”
xv] Volume I Chapter XV 103
“You’re a foul shrew, Mother* Gargery,” growled the journeyman. “If that makes a judge of rogues, you ought to be a good’un.”
(“Let her alone, will you?” said Joe.)
“What did you say?” cried my sister, beginning to scream. “What
did you say? What did that fellow Orlick say to me, Pip? What did he
call me, with my husband standing by? O! O! O!” Each of these
exclamations was a shriek; and I must remark of my sister, what is
equally true of all the violent women I have ever seen, that passion
was no excuse for her, because it is undeniable that instead of lapsing
into passion, she consciously and deliberately took extraordinary
pains to force herself into it, and became blindly furious by regular
stages; “what was the name he gave me before the base man who
swore to defend me? O! Hold me! O!”
“Ah-h-h!” growled the journeyman, between his teeth, “I’d hold
you, if you was my wife. I’d hold you under the pump, and choke it
out of you.”
(“I tell you, let her alone,” said Joe.)
“Oh! To hear him!” cried my sister, with a clap of her hands and a
scream, together––which was her next stage. “To hear the names
he’s giving me! That Orlick! In my own house! Me, a married
woman! With my husband standing by! O! O!” Here my sister, after
a fit of clappings and screamings, beat her hands upon her bosom
and upon her knees, and threw her cap off, and pulled her hair
down––which were the last stages on her road to frenzy. Being by
this time a perfect Fury* and a complete success, she made a dash at
the door, which I had fortunately locked.
What could the wretched Joe do now, after his disregarded parenthetical interruptions, but stand up to his journeyman, and ask him
what he meant by interfering betwixt himself and Mrs. Joe; and
further whether he was man enough to come on?* Old Orlick felt
that the situation admitted of nothing less than coming on, and was
on his defence straightway; so, without so much as pulling off their
singed and burnt aprons, they went at one another, like two giants.
But, if any man in that neighbourhood could stand up long against
Joe, I never saw the man. Orlick, as if he had been of no more
account than the pale young gentleman, was very soon among the
coal-dust, and in no hurry to come out of it. Then, Joe unlocked
the door and picked up my sister, who had dropped insensible at the
window (but who had seen the fight first, I think), and who was
104 Great Expectations
carried into the house and laid down, and who was recommended to
revive, and would do nothing but struggle and clench her hands in
Joe’s hair. Then, came that singular calm and silence which succeed
all uproars; and then, with the vague sensation which I have always
connected with such a lull––namely, that it was Sunday, and somebody was dead––I went up-stairs to dress myself.
When I came down again, I found Joe and Orlick sweeping up,
without any other traces of discomposure than a slit in one of
Orlick’s nostrils, which was neither expressive nor ornamental. A
pot of beer had appeared from the Jolly Bargemen, and they were
sharing it by turns in a peaceable manner. The lull had a sedative and
philosophical influence on Joe, who followed me out into the road
to say, as a parting observation that might do me good, “On the
Rampage, Pip, and off the Rampage, Pip––such is Life!”
With what absurd emotions (for, we think the feelings that are
very serious in a man quite comical in a boy) I found myself again
going to Miss Havisham’s, matters little here. Nor, how I passed and
repassed the gate many times before I could make up my mind to
ring. Nor, how I debated whether I should go away without ringing;
nor, how I should undoubtedly have gone, if my time had been my
own, to come back.
Miss Sarah Pocket came to the gate. No Estella.
“How, then? You here again?” said Miss Pocket. “What do you
want?”
When I said that I only came to see how Miss Havisham was,
Sarah evidently deliberated whether or no she should send me about
my business. But, unwilling to hazard the responsibility, she let me
in, and presently brought the sharp message that I was to “come up.”
Everything was unchanged, and Miss Havisham was alone.
“Well?” said she, fixing her eyes upon me. “I hope you want nothing?
You’ll get nothing.”
“No indeed, Miss Havisham. I only wanted you to know that I am
doing very well in my apprenticeship, and am always much obliged
to you.”
“There, there!” with the old restless fingers. “Come now and then;
come on your birthday.––Ay!” she cried suddenly, turning herself
and her chair towards me, “you are looking round for Estella? Hey?”
I had been looking round––in fact, for Estella––and I stammered
that I hoped she was well.
xv] Volume I Chapter XV 105
“Abroad,” said Miss Havisham; “educating for a lady; far out of
reach; prettier than ever; admired by all who see her. Do you feel that
you have lost her?”
There was such a malignant enjoyment in her utterance of the last
words, and she broke into such a disagreeable laugh, that I was at a
loss what to say. She spared me the trouble of considering, by dismissing me. When the gate was closed upon me by Sarah of the
walnut-shell countenance, I felt more than ever dissatisfied with my
home and with my trade and with everything; and that was all I took
by that motion.
As I was loitering along the High-street, looking in disconsolately
at the shop-windows, and thinking what I would buy if I were a
gentleman, who should come out of the bookshop but Mr. Wopsle.
Mr. Wopsle had in his hand the affecting tragedy of George Barnwell,* in which he had that moment invested sixpence, with the view
of heaping every word of it on the head of Pumblechook, with
whom he was going to drink tea. No sooner did he see me, than he
appeared to consider that a special Providence* had put a ’prentice
in his way to be read at; and he laid hold of me, and insisted on my
accompanying him to the Pumblechookian parlour. As I knew it
would be miserable at home, and as the nights were dark and the
way was dreary, and almost any companionship on the road was
better than none, I made no great resistance; consequently, we
turned into Pumblechook’s just as the street and the shops were
lighting up.
As I never assisted at any other representation of George Barnwell, I don’t know how long it may usually take; but I know very well
that it took until half-past nine o’clock that night, and that when Mr.
Wopsle got into Newgate, I thought he never would go to the scaffold, he became so much slower than at any former period of his
disgraceful career. I thought it a little too much that he should complain of being cut short in his flower after all, as if he had not been
running to seed, leaf after leaf, ever since his course began. This,
however, was a mere question of length and wearisomeness. What
stung me, was the identification of the whole affair with my
unoffending self. When Barnwell began to go wrong, I declare that I
felt positively apologetic, Pumblechook’s indignant stare so taxed me
with it. Wopsle, too, took pains to present me in the worst light. At
once ferocious and maudlin, I was made to murder my uncle with no
106 Great Expectations
extenuating circumstances whatever; Millwood put me down in
argument, on every occasion; it became sheer monomania in my
master’s daughter to care a button for me; and all I can say for my
gasping and procrastinating conduct on the fatal morning, is, that it
was worthy of the general feebleness of my character. Even after I
was happily hanged and Wopsle had closed the book, Pumblechook
sat staring at me, and shaking his head, and saying, “Take warning,
boy, take warning!” as if it were a well-known fact that I contemplated murdering a near relation, provided I could only induce one
to have the weakness to become my benefactor.
It was a very dark night when it was all over, and when I set out
with Mr. Wopsle on the walk home. Beyond town, we found a heavy
mist out, and it fell wet and thick. The turnpike* lamp was a blur,
quite out of the lamp’s usual place apparently, and its rays looked
solid substance on the fog. We were noticing this, and saying how
that the mist rose with a change of wind from a certain quarter of our
marshes, when we came upon a man, slouching under the lee of the
turnpike house.
“Halloa!” we said, stopping. “Orlick, there?”
“Ah!” he answered, slouching out. “I was standing by, a minute,
on the chance of company.”
“You are late,” I remarked.
Orlick not unnaturally answered, “Well? And you’re late.”
“We have been,” said Mr. Wopsle, exalted with his late performance, “we have been indulging, Mr. Orlick, in an intellectual
evening.”
Old Orlick growled, as if he had nothing to say about that, and we
all went on together. I asked him presently whether he had been
spending his half-holiday up and down town?
“Yes,” said he, “all of it. I come in behind yourself. I didn’t see
you, but I must have been pretty close behind you. By-the-by, the
guns is going again.”
“At the Hulks?” said I.
“Ay! There’s some of the birds flown from the cages. The guns
have been going since dark, about. You’ll hear one presently.”
In effect, we had not walked many yards further, when the wellremembered boom came towards us, deadened by the mist, and heavily rolled away along the low grounds by the river, as if it were
pursuing and threatening the fugitives.
xv] Volume I Chapter XV 107
“A good night for cutting off in,” said Orlick. “We’d be puzzled
how to bring down a jail-bird on the wing, to-night.”
The subject was a suggestive one to me, and I thought about it in
silence. Mr. Wopsle, as the ill-requited uncle of the evening’s tragedy, fell to meditating aloud in his garden at Camberwell. Orlick,
with his hands in his pockets, slouched heavily at my side. It was
very dark, very wet, very muddy, and so we splashed along. Now and
then, the sound of the signal cannon broke upon us again, and again
rolled sulkily along the course of the river. I kept myself to myself
and my thoughts. Mr. Wopsle died amiably at Camberwell,* and
exceedingly game on Bosworth Field,* and in the greatest agonies at
Glastonbury.* Orlick sometimes growled, “Beat it out, beat it out––
Old Clem! With a clink for the stout––old Clem!” I thought he had
been drinking, but he was not drunk.
Thus, we came to the village. The way by which we approached it,
took us past the Three Jolly Bargemen, which we were surprised to
find––it being eleven o’clock––in a state of commotion, with the
door wide open, and unwonted lights that had been hastily caught up
and put down, scattered about. Mr. Wopsle dropped in to ask what
was the matter (surmising that a convict had been taken), but came
running out in a great hurry.
“There’s something wrong,” said he, without stopping, “up at
your place, Pip. Run all!”
“What is it?” I asked, keeping up with him. So did Orlick, at my
side.
“I can’t quite understand. The house seems to have been violently
entered when Joe Gargery was out. Supposedly by convicts. Somebody has been attacked and hurt.’
We were running too fast to admit of more being said, and we
made no stop until we got into our kitchen. It was full of people; the
whole village was there, or in the yard; and there was a surgeon,*
and there was Joe, and there were a group of women, all on the floor
in the midst of the kitchen. The unemployed bystanders drew back
when they saw me, and so I became aware of my sister––lying without sense or movement on the bare boards where she had been
knocked down by a tremendous blow on the back of the head, dealt
with some unknown hand when her face was turned towards the
fire––destined never to be on the Rampage again, while she was wife
of Joe.
108 Great Expectations
CHAPTER XVI
With my head full of George Barnwell, I was at first disposed to
believe that I must have had some hand in the attack upon my sister,
or at all events that as her near relation, popularly known to be under
obligations to her, I was a more legitimate object of suspicion than
any one else. But when, in the clearer light of next morning, I began
to reconsider the matter and to hear it discussed around me on all
sides, I took another view of the case, which was more reasonable.
Joe had been at the Three Jolly Bargemen, smoking his pipe, from
a quarter after eight o’clock to a quarter before ten. While he was
there, my sister had been seen standing at the kitchen door, and had
exchanged Good Night with a farm-labourer going home. The man
could not be more particular as to the time at which he saw her (he
got into dense confusion when he tried to be), than that it must have
been before nine. When Joe went home at five minutes before ten,
he found her struck down on the floor, and promptly called in
assistance. The fire had not then burnt unusually low, nor was the
snuff of the candle very long; the candle, however, had been blown
out.
Nothing had been taken away from any part of the house. Neither,
beyond the blowing out of the candle––which stood on a table
between the door and my sister, and was behind her when she stood
facing the fire and was struck––was there any disarrangement of the
kitchen, excepting such as she herself had made, in falling and bleeding. But, there was one remarkable piece of evidence on the spot. She
had been struck with something blunt and heavy, on the head and
spine; after the blows were dealt, something heavy had been thrown
down at her with considerable violence, as she lay on her face. And
on the ground beside her, when Joe picked her up, was a convict’s
leg-iron which had been filed asunder.
Now, Joe, examining this iron with a smith’s eye, declared it to
have been filed asunder some time ago. The hue and cry going off to
the Hulks, and people coming thence to examine the iron, Joe’s
opinion was corroborated. They did not undertake to say when it
had left the prison-ships to which it undoubtedly had once
belonged; but they claimed to know for certain that that particular
manacle had not been worn by either of two convicts who had
xvi] Volume I Chapter XVI 109
escaped last night. Further, one of those two was already retaken,
and had not freed himself of his iron.
Knowing what I knew, I set up an inference of my own here. I believed the iron to be my convict’s iron––the iron I had seen and heard
him filing at, on the marshes––but my mind did not accuse him of
having put it to its latest use. For, I believed one of two other persons
to have become possessed of it, and to have turned it to this cruel
account. Either Orlick, or the strange man who had shown me the file.
Now, as to Orlick; he had gone to town exactly as he told us when
we picked him up at the turnpike, he had been seen about town all
the evening, he had been in divers companies in several publichouses, and he had come back with myself and Mr. Wopsle. There
was nothing against him, save the quarrel; and my sister had quarrelled with him, and with everybody else about her, ten thousand
times. As to the strange man; if he had come back for his two banknotes there could have been no dispute about them, because my
sister was fully prepared to restore them. Besides, there had been no
altercation; the assailant had come in so silently and suddenly, that
she had been felled before she could look round.
It was horrible to think that I had provided the weapon, however
undesignedly, but I could hardly think otherwise. I suffered
unspeakable trouble while I considered and reconsidered whether I
should at last dissolve that spell of my childhood, and tell Joe all the
story. For months afterwards, I every day settled the question finally
in the negative, and reopened and reargued it next morning. The
contention came, after all, to this;––the secret was such an old one
now, had so grown into me and become a part of myself, that I could
not tear it away. In addition to the dread that, having led up to so
much mischief, it would be now more likely than ever to alienate Joe
from me if he believed it, I had the further restraining dread that he
would not believe it, but would assort it with the fabulous dogs and
veal-cutlets as a monstrous invention. However, I temporised with
myself, of course––for, was I not wavering between right and wrong,
when the thing is always done?––and resolved to make a full disclosure if I should see any such new occasion as a new chance of
helping in the discovery of the assailant.
The Constables, and the Bow-street men* from London––for, this
happened in the days of the extinct red waistcoated police––were
about the house for a week or two, and did pretty much what I have
110 Great Expectations
heard and read of like authorities doing in other such cases. They
took up several obviously wrong people, and they ran their heads
very hard against wrong ideas, and persisted in trying to fit the
circumstances to the ideas, instead of trying to extract ideas from the
circumstances. Also, they stood about the door of the Jolly Bargemen, with knowing and reserved looks that filled the whole neighbourhood with admiration; and they had a mysterious manner of
taking their drink, that was almost as good as taking the culprit. But
not quite, for they never did it.
Long after these constitutional powers had dispersed, my sister
lay very ill in bed. Her sight was disturbed, so that she saw objects
multiplied, and grasped at visionary teacups and wine-glasses
instead of the realities; her hearing was greatly impaired; her memory also; and her speech was unintelligible. When, at last, she came
round so far as to be helped down stairs, it was still necessary to keep
my slate always by her, that she might indicate in writing what she
could not indicate in speech. As she was (very bad handwriting
apart) a more than indifferent speller, and as Joe was a more than
indifferent reader, extraordinary complications arose between them,
which I was always called in to solve. The administration of mutton
instead of medicine, the substitution of Tea for Joe, and the baker for
bacon, were among the mildest of my own mistakes.
However, her temper was greatly improved, and she was patient.
A tremulous uncertainty of the action of all her limbs soon became a
part of her regular state, and afterwards, at intervals of two or three
months, she would often put her hands to her head, and would then
remain for about a week at a time in some gloomy aberration of
mind. We were at a loss to find a suitable attendant for her, until a
circumstance happened conveniently to relieve us. Mr. Wopsle’s
great-aunt conquered a confirmed habit of living* into which she
had fallen, and Biddy became a part of our establishment.
It may have been about a month after my sister’s reappearance in
the kitchen, when Biddy came to us with a small speckled box containing the whole of her worldly effects, and became a blessing to the
household. Above all, she was a blessing to Joe, for the dear old
fellow was sadly cut up by the constant contemplation of the wreck
of his wife, and had been accustomed, while attending on her of an
evening, to turn to me every now and then and say, with his blue eyes
moistened, “Such a fine figure of a woman as she once were, Pip!”
xvi] Volume I Chapter XVI 111
Biddy instantly taking the cleverest charge of her as though she had
studied her from infancy, Joe became able in some sort to appreciate
the greater quiet of his life, and to get down to the Jolly Bargemen
now and then for a change that did him good. It was characteristic of
the police people that they had all more or less suspected poor Joe
(though he never knew it), and that they had to a man concurred in
regarding him as one of the deepest spirits they had ever
encountered.
Biddy’s first triumph in her new office, was to solve a difficulty
that had completely vanquished me. I had tried hard at it, but had
made nothing of it. Thus it was:
Again and again and again, my sister had traced upon the slate, a
character that looked like a curious T, and then with the utmost
eagerness had called our attention to it as something she particularly
wanted. I had in vain tried everything producible that began with a
T, from tar to toast and tub. At length it had come into my head that
the sign looked like a hammer, and on my lustily calling that word in
my sister’s ear, she had begun to hammer on the table and had
expressed a qualified assent. Thereupon, I had brought in all our
hammers, one after another, but without avail. Then I bethought me
of a crutch, the shape being much the same, and I borrowed one in
the village, and displayed it to my sister with considerable confidence. But she shook her head to that extent when she was shown
it, that we were terrified lest in her weak and shattered state she
should dislocate her neck.
When my sister found that Biddy was very quick to understand
her, this mysterious sign reappeared on the slate. Biddy looked
thoughtfully at it, heard my explanation, looked thoughtfully at my
sister, looked thoughtfully at Joe (who was always represented on the
slate by his initial letter), and ran into the forge, followed by Joe and
me.
“Why, of course!” cried Biddy, with an exultant face. “Don’t you
see? It’s him!”
Orlick, without a doubt! She had lost his name, and could only
signify him by his hammer. We told him why we wanted him to come
into the kitchen, and he slowly laid down his hammer, wiped his
brow with his arm, took another wipe at it with his apron, and came
slouching out, with a curious loose vagabond bend in the knees that
strongly distinguished him.
112 Great Expectations
I confess that I expected to see my sister denounce him, and that I
was disappointed by the different result. She manifested the greatest
anxiety to be on good terms with him, was evidently much pleased
by his being at length produced, and motioned that she would have
him given something to drink. She watched his countenance as if she
were particularly wishful to be assured that he took kindly to his
reception, she showed every possible desire to conciliate him, and
there was an air of humble propitiation in all she did, such as I have
seen pervade the bearing of a child towards a hard master. After that
day, a day rarely passed without her drawing the hammer on her
slate, and without Orlick’s slouching in and standing doggedly
before her, as if he knew no more than I did what to make of it.
CHAPTER XVII
I now fell into a regular routine of apprenticeship-life, which was
varied, beyond the limits of the village and the marshes, by no more
remarkable circumstance than the arrival of my birthday and my
paying another visit to Miss Havisham. I found Miss Sarah Pocket
still on duty at the gate, I found Miss Havisham just as I had left her,
and she spoke of Estella in the very same way, if not in the very same
words. The interview lasted but a few minutes, and she gave me a
guinea when I was going, and told me to come again on my next
birthday. I may mention at once that this became an annual custom. I
tried to decline taking the guinea on the first occasion, but with no
better effect than causing her to ask me very angrily, if I expected
more? Then, and after that, I took it.
So unchanging was the dull old house, the yellow light in the
darkened room, the faded spectre in the chair by the dressing-table
glass, that I felt as if the stopping of the clocks had stopped Time in
that mysterious place, and, while I and everything else outside it
grew older, it stood still. Daylight never entered the house as to my
thoughts and remembrances of it, any more than as to the actual fact.
It bewildered me, and under its influence I continued at heart to hate
my trade and to be ashamed of home.
Imperceptibly I became conscious of a change in Biddy, however.
Her shoes came up at the heel, her hair grew bright and neat, her
hands were always clean. She was not beautiful––she was common,
xvii] Volume I Chapter XVII 113
and could not be like Estella––but she was pleasant and wholesome
and sweet-tempered. She had not been with us more than a year (I
remember her being newly out of mourning at the time it struck
me), when I observed to myself one evening that she had curiously
thoughtful and attentive eyes; eyes that were very pretty and very good.
It came of my lifting up my own eyes from a task I was poring at––
writing some passages from a book, to improve myself in two ways at
once by a sort of stratagem––and seeing Biddy observant of what I
was about. I laid down my pen, and Biddy stopped in her needlework
without laying it down.
“Biddy,” said I, “how do you manage it? Either I am very stupid,
or you are very clever.”
“What is it that I manage? I don’t know,” returned Biddy, smiling.
She managed our whole domestic life, and wonderfully too; but I
did not mean that, though that made what I did mean, more
surprising.
“How do you manage, Biddy,” said I, “to learn everything that I
learn, and always to keep up with me?” I was beginning to be rather
vain of my knowledge, for I spent my birthday guineas on it, and set
aside the greater part of my pocket-money for similar investment;
though I have no doubt, now, that the little I knew was extremely
dear at the price.
“I might as well ask you,” said Biddy, “how you manage?”
“No; because when I come in from the forge of a night, any one
can see me turning to at it. But you never turn to at it, Biddy.”
“I suppose I must catch it––like a cough,” said Biddy, quietly; and
went on with her sewing.
Pursuing my idea as I leaned back in my wooden chair and looked
at Biddy sewing away with her head on one side, I began to think her
rather an extraordinary girl. For, I called to mind now, that she was
equally accomplished in the terms of our trade, and the names of our
different sorts of work, and our various tools. In short, whatever I
knew, Biddy knew. Theoretically, she was already as good a blacksmith as I, or better.
“You are one of those, Biddy,” said I, “who make the most of
every chance. You never had a chance before you came here, and see
how improved you are!”
Biddy looked at me for an instant, and went on with her sewing. “I
was your first teacher though; wasn’t I?” said she, as she sewed.
114 Great Expectations
“Biddy!” I exclaimed, in amazement. “Why, you are crying!”
“No I am not,” said Biddy, looking up and laughing. “What put
that in your head?”
What could have put it in my head, but the glistening of a tear as it
dropped on her work? I sat silent, recalling what a drudge she had
been until Mr. Wopsle’s great-aunt successfully overcame that bad
habit of living, so highly desirable to be got rid of by some people. I
recalled the hopeless circumstances by which she had been surrounded in the miserable little shop and the miserable little noisy
evening school, with that miserable old bundle of incompetence
always to be dragged and shouldered. I reflected that even in those
untoward times there must have been latent in Biddy what was now
developing, for, in my first uneasiness and discontent I had turned to
her for help, as a matter of course. Biddy sat quietly sewing, shedding no more tears, and while I looked at her and thought about it
all, it occurred to me that perhaps I had not been sufficiently grateful
to Biddy. I might have been too reserved, and should have patronised
her more (though I did not use that precise word in my meditations),
with my confidence.
“Yes, Biddy,” I observed, when I had done turning it over, “you
were my first teacher, and that at a time when we little thought of
ever being together like this, in this kitchen.”
“Ah, poor thing!” replied Biddy. It was like her self-forgetfulness,
to transfer the remark to my sister, and to get up and be busy about
her, making her more comfortable; “that’s sadly true!”
“Well!” said I, “we must talk together a little more, as we used to
do. And I must consult you a little more, as I used to do. Let us have
a quiet walk on the marshes next Sunday, Biddy, and a long chat.”
My sister was never left alone now; but Joe more than readily
undertook the care of her on that Sunday afternoon, and Biddy and I
went out together. It was summer-time, and lovely weather. When
we had passed the village and the church and the churchyard, and
were out on the marshes and began to see the sails of the ships as
they sailed on, I began to combine Miss Havisham and Estella with
the prospect, in my usual way. When we came to the riverside and sat
down on the bank, with the water rippling at our feet, making it all
more quiet than it would have been without that sound, I resolved
that it was a good time and place for the admission of Biddy into my
inner confidence.
xvii] Volume I Chapter XVII 115
“Biddy,” said I, after binding her to secrecy, “I want to be a
gentleman.”
“Oh, I wouldn’t, if I was you!” she returned. “I don’t think it
would answer.”
“Biddy,” said I, with some severity, “I have particular reasons for
wanting to be a gentleman.”
“You know best, Pip; but don’t you think you are happier as you
are?”
“Biddy,” I exclaimed, impatiently, “I am not at all happy as I am. I
am disgusted with my calling and with my life. I have never taken to
either, since I was bound. Don’t be absurd.”
“Was I absurd?” said Biddy, quietly raising her eyebrows; “I am
sorry for that; I didn’t mean to be. I only want you to do well, and to
be comfortable.”
“Well then, understand once for all that I never shall or can be
comfortable––or anything but miserable––there, Biddy!––unless I
can lead a very different sort of life from the life I lead now.”
“That’s a pity!” said Biddy, shaking her head with a sorrowful air.
Now, I too had so often thought it a pity, that, in the singular
kind of quarrel with myself which I was always carrying on, I was
half inclined to shed tears of vexation and distress when Biddy gave
utterance to her sentiment and my own. I told her she was right,
and I knew it was much to be regretted, but still it was not to be
helped.
“If I could have settled down,” I said to Biddy, plucking up the
short grass within reach, much as I had once upon a time pulled my
feelings out of my hair and kicked them into the brewery wall: “if I
could have settled down and been but half as fond of the forge as I
was when I was little, I know it would have been much better for me.
You and I and Joe would have wanted nothing then, and Joe and I
would perhaps have gone partners when I was out of my time, and I
might even have grown up to keep company with you, and we might
have sat on this very bank on a fine Sunday, quite different people. I
should have been good enough for you; shouldn’t I, Biddy?”
Biddy sighed as she looked at the ships sailing on, and returned
for answer, “Yes; I am not over-particular.” It scarcely sounded flattering, but I knew she meant well.
“Instead of that,” said I, plucking up more grass and chewing a
blade or two, “see how I am going on. Dissatisfied, and uncomfort116 Great Expectations
able, and––what would it signify to me, being coarse and common, if
nobody had told me so!”
Biddy turned her face suddenly towards mine, and looked far
more attentively at me than she had looked at the sailing ships.
“It was neither a very true nor a very polite thing to say,” she
remarked, directing her eyes to the ships again. “Who said it?”
I was disconcerted, for I had broken away without quite seeing
where I was going. It was not to be shuffled off now, however, and I
answered, “The beautiful young lady at Miss Havisham’s, and she’s
more beautiful than anybody ever was, and I admire her dreadfully,
and I want to be a gentleman on her account.” Having made this
lunatic confession, I began to throw my torn-up grass into the river,
as if I had some thoughts of following it.
“Do you want to be a gentleman, to spite her or to gain her over?”
Biddy quietly asked me, after a pause.
“I don’t know,” I moodily answered.
“Because, if it is to spite her,” Biddy pursued, “I should think––
but you know best––that might be better and more independently
done by caring nothing for her words. And if it is to gain her over,
I should think––but you know best––she was not worth gaining
over.”
Exactly what I myself had thought, many times. Exactly what was
perfectly manifest to me at the moment. But how could I, a poor
dazed village lad, avoid that wonderful inconsistency into which the
best and wisest of men fall every day?
“It may be all quite true,” said I to Biddy, “but I admire her
dreadfully.”
In short, I turned over on my face when I came to that, and got a
good grasp on the hair on each side of my head, and wrenched it
well. All the while knowing the madness of my heart to be so very
mad and misplaced, that I was quite conscious it would have served
my face right, if I had lifted it up by my hair, and knocked it against
the pebbles as a punishment for belonging to such an idiot.
Biddy was the wisest of girls, and she tried to reason no more with
me. She put her hand, which was a comfortable hand though roughened by work, upon my hands, one after another, and gently took
them out of my hair. Then she softly patted my shoulder in a soothing way, while with my face upon my sleeve I cried a little––exactly
as I had done in the brewery yard––and felt vaguely convinced that I
xvii] Volume I Chapter XVII 117
was very much ill used by somebody, or by everybody; I can’t say
which.
“I am glad of one thing,” said Biddy, “and that is, that you have
felt you could give me your confidence, Pip. And I am glad of
another thing, and that is, that of course you know you may depend
upon my keeping it and always so far deserving it. If your first
teacher (dear! such a poor one, and so much in need of being taught
herself !) had been your teacher at the present time, she thinks she
knows what lesson she would set. But it would be a hard one to learn,
and you have got beyond her, and it’s of no use now.” So, with a quiet
sigh for me, Biddy rose from the bank, and said, with a fresh and
pleasant change of voice, “Shall we walk a little further, or go
home?”
“Biddy,” I cried, getting up, putting my arm round her neck, and
giving her a kiss, “I shall always tell you everything.”
“Till you’re a gentleman,” said Biddy.
“You know I never shall be, so that’s always. Not that I have any
occasion to tell you anything, for you know everything I know––as I
told you at home the other night.”
“Ah!” said Biddy, quite in a whisper, as she looked away at the
ships. And then repeated, with her former pleasant change; “shall we
walk a little further, or go home?”
I said to Biddy we would walk a little further, and we did so, and
the summer afternoon toned down into the summer evening, and it
was very beautiful. I began to consider whether I was not more
naturally and wholesomely situated, after all, in these circumstances,
than playing beggar my neighbour by candlelight in the room with
the stopped clocks, and being despised by Estella. I thought it would
be very good for me if I could get her out of my head, with all the
rest of those remembrances and fancies, and could go to work
determined to relish what I had to do, and stick to it, and make the
best of it. I asked myself the question whether I did not surely know
that if Estella were beside me at that moment instead of Biddy, she
would make me miserable? I was obliged to admit that I did know it
for a certainty, and I said to myself, “Pip, what a fool you are!”
We talked a good deal as we walked, and all that Biddy said seemed
right. Biddy was never insulting, or capricious, or Biddy to-day and
somebody else to-morrow; she would have derived only pain, and no
pleasure, from giving me pain; she would far rather have wounded
118 Great Expectations
her own breast than mine. How could it be, then, that I did not like
her much the better of the two?
“Biddy,” said I, when we were walking homeward, “I wish you
could put me right.”
“I wish I could!” said Biddy.
“If I could only get myself to fall in love with you––you don’t
mind my speaking so openly to such an old acquaintance?”
“Oh dear, not at all!” said Biddy. “Don’t mind me.”
“If I could only get myself to do it, that would be the thing for me.”
“But you never will, you see,” said Biddy.
It did not appear quite so unlikely to me that evening, as it would
have done if we had discussed it a few hours before. I therefore
observed I was not quite sure of that. But Biddy said she was, and
she said it decisively. In my heart I believed her to be right; and yet I
took it rather ill, too, that she should be so positive on the point.
When we came near the churchyard, we had to cross an embankment, and get over a stile near a sluice-gate. There started up, from
the gate, or from the rushes, or from the ooze (which was quite in his
stagnant way), old Orlick.
“Halloa!” he growled, “where are you two going?”
Where should we be going, but home? “Well then,” said he, “I’m
jiggered if I don’t see you home!”
This penalty of being jiggered was a favourite supposititious case
of his. He attached no definite meaning to the word that I am aware
of, but used it, like his own pretended christian name, to affront
mankind, and convey an idea of something savagely damaging. When
I was younger, I had had a general belief that if he had jiggered me
personally, he would have done it with a sharp and twisted hook.
Biddy was much against his going with us, and said to me in a
whisper, “Don’t let him come; I don’t like him.” As I did not like
him either, I took the liberty of saying that we thanked him, but we
didn’t want seeing home. He received that piece of information with
a yell of laughter, and dropped back, but came slouching after us at a
little distance.
Curious to know whether Biddy suspected him of having had a
hand in that murderous attack of which my sister had never been
able to give any account, I asked her why she did not like him?
“Oh!” she replied, glancing over her shoulder as he slouched after
us, “because I––I am afraid he likes me.”
xvii] Volume I Chapter XVII 119
“Did he ever tell you he liked you?” I asked, indignantly.
“No,” said Biddy, glancing over her shoulder again, “he never told
me so; but he dances at me, whenever he can catch my eye.”
However novel and peculiar this testimony of attachment, I did
not doubt the accuracy of the interpretation. I was very hot indeed
upon old Orlick’s daring to admire her; as hot as if it were an outrage
on myself.
“But it makes no difference to you, you know,” said Biddy calmly.
“No, Biddy, it makes no difference to me; only I don’t like it; I
don’t approve of it.”
“Nor I neither,” said Biddy. “Though that makes no difference to
you.”
“Exactly,” said I; “but I must tell you I should have no opinion of
you, Biddy, if he danced at you with your own consent.”
I kept an eye on Orlick after that night, and, whenever circumstances were favourable to his dancing at Biddy, got before him, to
obscure that demonstration. He had struck root in Joe’s establishment, by reason of my sister’s sudden fancy for him, or I should have
tried to get him dismissed. He quite understood and reciprocated
my good intentions, as I had reason to know thereafter.
And now, because my mind was not confused enough before, I
complicated its confusion fifty thousand-fold, by having states and
seasons when I was clear that Biddy was immeasurably better than
Estella, and that the plain honest working life to which I was born,
had nothing in it to be ashamed of, but offered me sufficient means
of self-respect and happiness. At those times, I would decide conclusively that my disaffection to dear old Joe and the forge, was gone,
and that I was growing up in a fair way to be partners with Joe and to
keep company with Biddy––when all in a moment some confounding remembrance of the Havisham days would fall upon me, like a
destructive missile, and scatter my wits again. Scattered wits take a
long time picking up; and often, before I had got them well together,
they would be dispersed in all directions by one stray thought, that
perhaps after all Miss Havisham was going to make my fortune when
my time was out.
If my time had run out, it would have left me still at the height of
my perplexities, I dare say. It never did run out, however, but was
brought to a premature end, as I proceed to relate.
120 Great Expectations
CHAPTER XVIII
It was in the fourth year of my apprenticeship to Joe, and it was a
Saturday night. There was a group assembled round the fire at the
Three Jolly Bargemen, attentive to Mr. Wopsle as he read the newspaper aloud. Of that group I was one.
A highly popular murder had been committed, and Mr. Wopsle
was imbrued in blood to the eyebrows. He gloated over every abhorrent adjective in the description, and identified himself with every
witness at the Inquest. He faintly moaned, “I am done for,” as the
victim, and he barbarously bellowed, “I’ll serve you out,” as the
murderer. He gave the medical testimony, in pointed imitation of our
local practitioner; and he piped and shook, as the aged turnpikekeeper who had heard blows, to an extent so very paralytic as to
suggest a doubt regarding the mental competency of that witness.
The coroner, in Mr. Wopsle’s hands, became Timon of Athens; the
beadle, Coriolanus.* He enjoyed himself thoroughly, and we all
enjoyed ourselves, and were delightfully comfortable. In this cozy
state of mind we came to the verdict Wilful Murder.
Then, and not sooner, I became aware of a strange gentleman
leaning over the back of the settle opposite me, looking on. There
was an expression of contempt on his face, and he bit the side of a
great forefinger as he watched the group of faces. “Well!” said the
stranger to Mr. Wopsle, when the reading was done, “you have settled it all to your own satisfaction, I have no doubt?”
Everybody started and looked up, as if it were the murderer. He
looked at everybody coldly and sarcastically.
“Guilty, of course?” said he. “Out with it. Come!”
“Sir,” returned Mr. Wopsle, “without having the honour of your
acquaintance, I do say Guilty.” Upon this, we all took courage to
unite in a confirmatory murmur.
“I know you do,” said the stranger; “I knew you would. I told you
so. But now I’ll ask you a question. Do you know, or do you not
know, that the law of England supposes every man to be innocent,
until he is proved––proved––to be guilty?”
“Sir,” Mr. Wopsle began to reply, “as an Englishman myself,
I––––”
“Come!” said the stranger, biting his forefinger at him. “Don’t
xviii] Volume I Chapter XVIII 121
evade the question. Either you know it, or you don’t know it. Which
is it to be?”
He stood with his head on one side and himself on one side, in a
bullying interrogative manner, and he threw his forefinger at Mr.
Wopsle––as it were to mark him out––before biting it again.
“Now!” said he. “Do you know it, or don’t you know it?”
“Certainly I know it,” replied Mr. Wopsle.
“Certainly you know it. Then why didn’t you say so at first? Now,
I’ll ask you another question;” taking possession of Mr. Wopsle, as if
he had a right to him. “Do you know that none of these witnesses
have yet been cross-examined?”
Mr. Wopsle was beginning, “I can only say––––” when the stranger stopped him.
“What? You won’t answer the question, yes or no? Now, I’ll try
you again.” Throwing his finger at him again. “Attend to me. Are
you aware, or are you not aware, that none of these witnesses have yet
been cross-examined? Come, I only want one word from you. Yes, or
no?”
Mr. Wopsle hesitated, and we all began to conceive rather a poor
opinion of him.
“Come!” said the stranger, “I’ll help you. You don’t deserve help,
but I’ll help you. Look at that paper you hold in your hand. What is
it?”
“What is it?” repeated Mr. Wopsle, eyeing it, much at a loss.
“Is it,” pursued the stranger in his most sarcastic and suspicious
manner, “the printed paper you have just been reading from?”
“Undoubtedly.”
“Undoubtedly. Now turn to that paper, and tell me whether it
distinctly states that the prisoner expressly said that his legal
advisers instructed him altogether to reserve his defence?”*
“I read that just now,” Mr. Wopsle pleaded.
“Never mind what you read just now, sir; I don’t ask you what you
read just now. You may read the Lord’s Prayer backwards,* if you
like––and, perhaps, have done it before to-day. Turn to the paper.
No, no, no, my friend; not to the top of the column; you know better
than that; to the bottom, to the bottom.” (We all began to think Mr.
Wopsle full of subterfuge.) “Well? Have you found it?”
“Here it is,” said Mr. Wopsle.
“Now, follow that passage with your eye, and tell me whether it
122 Great Expectations
distinctly states that the prisoner expressly said that he was
instructed by his legal advisers wholly to reserve his defence? Come!
Do you make that of it?”
Mr. Wopsle answered, “Those are not the exact words.”
“Not the exact words!” repeated the gentleman, bitterly. “Is that
the exact substance?”
“Yes,” said Mr. Wopsle.
“Yes,” repeated the stranger, looking round at the rest of the
company with his right hand extended towards the witness, Wopsle.
“And now I ask you what you say to the conscience of that man who,
with that passage before his eyes, can lay his head upon his pillow
after having pronounced a fellow-creature guilty, unheard?”
We all began to suspect that Mr. Wopsle was not the man we had
thought him, and that he was beginning to be found out.
“And that same man, remember,” pursued the gentleman, throwing his finger at Mr. Wopsle heavily; “that same man might be summoned as a juryman upon this very trial, and, having thus deeply
committed himself, might return to the bosom of his family and lay
his head upon his pillow, after deliberately swearing that he would
well and truly try the issue joined between Our Sovereign Lord the
King and the prisoner at the bar, and would a true verdict give
according to the evidence, so help him God!”
We were all deeply persuaded that the unfortunate Wopsle had
gone too far, and had better stop in his reckless career while there
was yet time.
The strange gentleman, with an air of authority not to be disputed, and with a manner expressive of knowing something secret
about every one of us that would effectually do for each individual if
he chose to disclose it, left the back of the settle, and came into the
space between the two settles, in front of the fire, where he remained
standing: his left hand in his pocket, and he biting the forefinger of
his right.
“From information I have received,” said he, looking round at us
as we all quailed before him, “I have reason to believe there is a
blacksmith among you, by name Joseph––or Joe––Gargery. Which is
the man?”
“Here is the man,” said Joe.
The strange gentleman beckoned him out of his place, and Joe
went.
xviii] Volume I Chapter XVIII 123
“You have an apprentice,” pursued the stranger, “commonly
known as Pip? Is he here?”
“I am here!” I cried.
The stranger did not recognise me, but I recognised him as the
gentleman I had met on the stairs, on the occasion of my second visit
to Miss Havisham. I had known him the moment I saw him looking
over the settle, and now that I stood confronting him with his hand
upon my shoulder, I checked off again in detail, his large head, his
dark complexion, his deep-set eyes, his bushy black eyebrows, his
large watch-chain, his strong black dots of beard and whisker, and
even the smell of scented soap on his great hand.
“I wish to have a private conference with you two,” said he, when
he had surveyed me at his leisure. “It will take a little time. Perhaps
we had better go to your place of residence. I prefer not to anticipate
my communication here; you will impart as much or as little of it as
you please to your friends afterwards; I have nothing to do with that.”
Amidst a wondering silence, we three walked out of the Jolly
Bargemen, and in a wondering silence walked home. While going
along, the strange gentleman occasionally looked at me, and
occasionally bit the side of his finger. As we neared home, Joe vaguely
acknowledging the occasion as an impressive and ceremonious one,
went on ahead to open the front door. Our conference was held in
the state parlour, which was feebly lighted by one candle.
It began with the strange gentleman’s sitting down at the table,
drawing the candle to him, and looking over some entries in his
pocket-book. He then put up the pocket-book and set the candle a
little aside: after peering round it into the darkness at Joe and me, to
ascertain which was which.
“My name,” he said, “is Jaggers, and I am a lawyer in London. I
am pretty well known. I have unusual business to transact with you,
and I commence by explaining that it is not of my originating. If my
advice had been asked, I should not have been here. It was not asked,
and you see me here. What I have to do as the confidential agent of
another, I do. No less, no more.”
Finding that he could not see us very well from where he sat, he
got up, and threw one leg over the back of a chair and leaned upon it;
thus having one foot on the seat of the chair, and one foot on the
ground.
“Now, Joseph Gargery, I am the bearer of an offer to relieve you of
124 Great Expectations
this young fellow your apprentice. You would not object to cancel his
indentures, at his request and for his good? You would not want
anything for so doing?”
“Lord forbid that I should want anything for not standing in Pip’s
way,” said Joe, staring.
“Lord forbidding is pious, but not to the purpose,” returned Mr.
Jaggers. “The question is, Would you want anything? Do you want
anything?”
“The answer is,” returned Joe, sternly, “No.”
I thought Mr. Jaggers glanced at Joe, as if he considered him a fool
for his disinterestedness. But I was too much bewildered between
breathless curiosity and surprise, to be sure of it.
“Very well,” said Mr. Jaggers. “Recollect the admission you have
made, and don’t try to go from it presently.”
“Who’s a going to try?” retorted Joe.
“I don’t say anybody is. Do you keep a dog?”
“Yes, I do keep a dog.”
“Bear in mind then, that Brag is a good dog, but Holdfast* is a
better. Bear that in mind, will you?” repeated Mr. Jaggers, shutting
his eyes and nodding his head at Joe, as if he were forgiving him
something. “Now, I return to this young fellow. And the communication I have got to make is, that he has great expectations.”
Joe and I gasped, and looked at one another.
“I am instructed to communicate to him,” said Mr. Jaggers,
throwing his finger at me, sideways, “that he will come into a handsome property. Further, that it is the desire of the present possessor
of that property, that he be immediately removed from his present
sphere of life and from this place, and be brought up as a
gentleman––in a word, as a young fellow of great expectations.”
My dream was out; my wild fancy was surpassed by sober reality;
Miss Havisham was going to make my fortune on a grand scale.
“Now, Mr. Pip,” pursued the lawyer, “I address the rest of what I
have to say, to you. You are to understand, first, that it is the request
of the person from whom I take my instructions, that you always
bear the name of Pip. You will have no objection, I dare say, to your
great expectations being encumbered with that easy condition. But
if you have any objection, this is the time to mention it.”
My heart was beating so fast, and there was such a singing in my
ears, that I could scarcely stammer I had no objection.
xviii] Volume I Chapter XVIII 125
“I should think not! Now you are to understand, secondly, Mr.
Pip, that the name of the person who is your liberal benefactor
remains a profound secret, until the person chooses to reveal it. I am
empowered to mention that it is the intention of the person to reveal
it at first hand by word of mouth to yourself. When or where that
intention may be carried out, I cannot say; no one can say. It may be
years hence. Now, you are distinctly to understand that you are most
positively prohibited from making any inquiry on this head, or any
allusion or reference, however distant, to any individual whomsoever
as the individual, in all the communications you may have with me. If
you have a suspicion in your own breast, keep that suspicion in your
own breast. It is not the least to the purpose what the reasons of this
prohibition are; they may be the strongest and gravest reasons, or
they may be mere whim. That is not for you to inquire into. The
condition is laid down. Your acceptance of it, and your observance of
it as binding, is the only remaining condition that I am charged with,
by the person from whom I take my instructions, and for whom I am
not otherwise responsible. That person is the person from whom you
derive your expectations, and the secret is solely held by that person
and by me. Again, not a very difficult condition with which to
encumber such a rise in fortune; but if you have any objection to it,
this is the time to mention it. Speak out.”
Once more, I stammered with difficulty that I had no objection.
“I should think not! Now, Mr. Pip, I have done with stipulations.”
Though he called me Mr. Pip, and began rather to make up to me, he
still could not get rid of a certain air of bullying suspicion; and even
now he occasionally shut his eyes and threw his finger at me while he
spoke, as much as to express that he knew all kinds of things to my
disparagement, if he only chose to mention them. “We come next, to
mere details of arrangement. You must know that, although I have
used the term ‘expectations’ more than once, you are not endowed
with expectations only. There is already lodged in my hands, a sum
of money amply sufficient for your suitable education and maintenance. You will please consider me your guardian. Oh!” for I was
going to thank him, “I tell you at once, I am paid for my services, or I
shouldn’t render them. It is considered that you must be better
educated, in accordance with your altered position, and that you will
be alive to the importance and necessity of at once entering on that
advantage.”
126 Great Expectations
I said I had always longed for it.
“Never mind what you have always longed for, Mr. Pip,” he
retorted; “keep to the record. If you long for it now, that’s enough.
Am I answered that you are ready to be placed at once, under some
proper tutor? Is that it?”
I stammered yes, that was it.
“Good. Now, your inclinations are to be consulted. I don’t think
that wise, mind, but it’s my trust. Have you ever heard of any tutor
whom you would prefer to another?”
I had never heard of any tutor but Biddy and Mr. Wopsle’s greataunt; so, I replied in the negative.
“There is a certain tutor, of whom I have some knowledge, who I
think might suit the purpose,” said Mr. Jaggers. “I don’t recommend
him, observe; because I never recommend anybody. The gentleman I
speak of, is one Mr. Matthew Pocket.”
Ah! I caught at the name directly. Miss Havisham’s relation. The
Matthew whom Mr. and Mrs. Camilla had spoken of. The Matthew
whose place was to be at Miss Havisham’s head, when she lay dead,
in her bride’s dress on the bride’s table.
“You know the name?” said Mr. Jaggers, looking shrewdly at me,
and then shutting up his eyes while he waited for my answer.
My answer was, that I had heard of the name.
“Oh!” said he. “You have heard of the name. But the question is,
what do you say of it?”
I said, or tried to say, that I was much obliged to him for his
recommendation––––
“No, my young friend!” he interrupted, shaking his great head
very slowly. “Recollect yourself !”
Not recollecting myself, I began again that I was much obliged to
him for his recommendation––––
“No, my young friend,” he interrupted, shaking his head and
frowning and smiling both at once; “no, no, no; it’s very well done,
but it won’t do; you are too young to fix me with it. Recommendation is not the word, Mr. Pip. Try another.”
Correcting myself, I said that I was much obliged to him for his
mention of Mr. Matthew Pocket––––
“That’s more like it!” cried Mr. Jaggers.
––––And (I added), I would gladly try that gentleman.
“Good. You had better try him in his own house. The way shall be
xviii] Volume I Chapter XVIII 127
prepared for you, and you can see his son first, who is in London.
When will you come to London?”
I said (glancing at Joe, who stood looking on, motionless), that I
supposed I could come directly.
“First,” said Mr. Jaggers, “you should have some new clothes to
come in, and they should not be working clothes. Say this day week.
You’ll want some money. Shall I leave you twenty guineas?”
He produced a long purse,* with the greatest coolness, and
counted them out on the table and pushed them over to me. This was
the first time he had taken his leg from the chair. He sat astride of the
chair when he had pushed the money over, and sat swinging his
purse and eyeing Joe.
“Well, Joseph Gargery? You look dumbfoundered?”
“I am!” said Joe, in a very decided manner.
“It was understood that you wanted nothing for yourself,
remember?”
“It were understood,” said Joe. “And it are understood. And it
ever will be similar according.”
“But what,” said Mr. Jaggers, swinging his purse, “what if it was
in my instructions to make you a present, as compensation?”
“As compensation what for?” Joe demanded.
“For the loss of his services.”
Joe laid his hand upon my shoulder with the touch of a woman. I
have often thought him since, like the steam-hammer, that can crush
a man or pat an eggshell, in his combination of strength with gentleness. “Pip is that harty welcome,” said Joe, “to go free with his
services, to honour and fortun’, as no words can tell him. But if you
think as Money––can make compensation to me––fur the loss of the
little child––what come to the forge––and ever the best of
friends!––––”
O dear good Joe, whom I was so ready to leave and so unthankful
to, I see you again, with your muscular blacksmith’s arm before your
eyes, and your broad chest heaving, and your voice dying away. O
dear good faithful tender Joe, I feel the loving tremble of your hand
upon my arm, as solemnly this day as if it had been the rustle of an
angel’s wing!
But I encouraged Joe at the time. I was lost in the mazes of my
future fortunes, and could not retrace the by-paths we had trodden
together. I begged Joe to be comforted, for (as he said) we had ever
128 Great Expectations
been the best of friends, and (as I said) we ever would be so. Joe
scooped his eyes with his disengaged wrist, as if he were bent on
gouging himself, but said not another word.
Mr. Jaggers had looked on at this, as one who recognised in Joe the
village idiot, and in me his keeper. When it was over, he said, weighing in his hand the purse he had ceased to swing:
“Now, Joseph Gargery, I warn you this is your last chance. No half
measures with me. If you mean to take a present that I have it in
charge to make you, speak out, and you shall have it. If on the
contrary you mean to say––––” Here, to his great amazement, he
was stopped by Joe’s suddenly working round him with every demonstration of a fell pugilistic purpose.
“Which I meantersay,” cried Joe, “that if you come into my place
bull-baiting and badgering me, come out! Which I meantersay as
sech if you’re a man, come on! Which I meantersay that what I say, I
meantersay and stand or fall by!”
I drew Joe away, and he immediately became placable; merely
stating to me, in an obliging manner and as a polite expostulatory
notice to any one whom it might happen to concern, that he were not
a going to be bull-baited and badgered in his own place. Mr. Jaggers
had risen when Joe demonstrated, and had backed near the door.
Without evincing any inclination to come in again, he there
delivered his valedictory remarks. They were these.
“Well, Mr. Pip, I think the sooner you leave here––as you are to be
a gentleman––the better. Let it stand for this day week, and you shall
receive my printed address in the mean time. You can take a
hackney-coach at the stage coach-office in London, and come
straight to me. Understand, that I express no opinion, one way or
other, on the trust I undertake. I am paid for undertaking it, and I do
so. Now, understand that, finally. Understand that!”
He was throwing his finger at both of us, and I think would have
gone on, but for his seeming to think Joe dangerous, and going
off.
Something came into my head which induced me to run after him,
as he was going down to the Jolly Bargemen where he had left a hired
carriage.
“I beg your pardon, Mr. Jaggers.”
“Halloa!” said he, facing round, “what’s the matter?”
“I wish to be quite right, Mr. Jaggers, and to keep to your
xviii] Volume I Chapter XVIII 129
directions; so I thought I had better ask. Would there be any objection
to my taking leave of any one I know, about here, before I go away?”
“No,” said he, looking as if he hardly understood me.
“I don’t mean in the village only, but up-town?”
“No,” said he. “No objection.”
I thanked him and ran home again, and there I found that Joe had
already locked the front door and vacated the state parlour, and was
seated by the kitchen fire with a hand on each knee, gazing intently
at the burning coals. I too sat down before the fire and gazed at the
coals, and nothing was said for a long time.
My sister was in her cushioned chair in her corner, and Biddy sat
at her needlework before the fire, and Joe sat next Biddy, and I sat
next Joe in the corner opposite my sister. The more I looked into the
glowing coals, the more incapable I became of looking at Joe; the
longer the silence lasted, the more unable I felt to speak.
At length I got out, “Joe, have you told Biddy?”
“No, Pip,” returned Joe, still looking at the fire, and holding his
knees tight, as if he had private information that they intended to
make off somewhere, “which I left it to yourself, Pip.”
“I would rather you told, Joe.”
“Pip’s a gentleman of fortun’ then,” said Joe, “and God bless him
in it!”
Biddy dropped her work, and looked at me. Joe held his knees and
looked at me. I looked at both of them. After a pause, they both
heartily congratulated me; but there was a certain touch of sadness
in their congratulations, that I rather resented.
I took it upon myself to impress Biddy (and through Biddy, Joe)
with the grave obligation I considered my friends under, to know
nothing and say nothing about the maker of my fortune. It would all
come out in good time, I observed, and in the mean while nothing
was to be said, save that I had come into great expectations from a
mysterious patron. Biddy nodded her head thoughtfully at the fire as
she took up her work again, and said she would be very particular;
and Joe, still detaining his knees, said, “Ay, ay, I’ll be ekervally
partickler, Pip;” and then they congratulated me again, and went on
to express so much wonder at the notion of my being a gentleman,
that I didn’t half like it.
Infinite pains were then taken by Biddy to convey to my sister
some idea of what had happened. To the best of my belief, those
130 Great Expectations
efforts entirely failed. She laughed and nodded her head a great
many times, and even repeated after Biddy, the words “Pip” and
“Property.” But I doubt if they had more meaning in them than an
election cry,* and I cannot suggest a darker picture of her state of
mind.
I never could have believed it without experience, but as Joe and
Biddy became more at their cheerful ease again, I became quite
gloomy. Dissatisfied with my fortune, of course I could not be; but it
is possible that I may have been, without quite knowing it, dissatisfied with myself.
Anyhow, I sat with my elbow on my knee and my face upon my
hand, looking into the fire, as those two talked about my going away,
and about what they should do without me, and all that. And whenever I caught one of them looking at me, though never so pleasantly
(and they often looked at me––particularly Biddy), I felt offended: as
if they were expressing some mistrust of me. Though Heaven knows
they never did by word or sign.
At those times I would get up and look out at the door; for, our
kitchen door opened at once upon the night, and stood open on
summer evenings to air the room. The very stars to which I then
raised my eyes, I am afraid I took to be but poor and humble stars for
glittering on the rustic objects among which I had passed my life.
“Saturday night,” said I, when we sat at our supper of bread-andcheese and beer. “Five more days, and then the day before the day!
They’ll soon go.”
“Yes, Pip,” observed Joe, whose voice sounded hollow in his beer
mug. “They’ll soon go.”
“Soon, soon go,” said Biddy.
“I have been thinking, Joe, that when I go down town on Monday,
and order my new clothes, I shall tell the tailor that I’ll come and put
them on there, or that I’ll have them sent to Mr. Pumblechook’s. It
would be very disagreeable to be stared at by all the people here.”
“Mr. and Mrs. Hubble might like to see you in your new gen-teel
figure too, Pip,” said Joe, industriously cutting his bread, with his
cheese on it, in the palm of his left hand, and glancing at my untasted
supper as if he thought of the time when we used to compare slices.
“So might Wopsle. And the Jolly Bargemen might take it as a
compliment.”
“That’s just what I don’t want, Joe. They would make such a
xviii] Volume I Chapter XVIII 131
business of it––such a coarse and common business––that I couldn’t
bear myself.”
“Ah, that indeed, Pip!” said Joe. “If you couldn’t abear
yourself––––”
Biddy asked me here, as she sat holding my sister’s plate, “Have
you thought about when you’ll show yourself to Mr. Gargery, and
your sister, and me? You will show yourself to us; won’t you?”
“Biddy,” I returned with some resentment, “you are so exceedingly quick that it’s difficult to keep up with you.”
(“She always were quick,” observed Joe.)
“If you had waited another moment, Biddy, you would have heard
me say that I shall bring my clothes here in a bundle one evening––
most likely on the evening before I go away.”
Biddy said no more. Handsomely forgiving her, I soon exchanged
an affectionate good night with her and Joe, and went up to bed.
When I got into my little room, I sat down and took a long look at it,
as a mean little room that I should soon be parted from and raised
above, for ever. It was furnished with fresh young remembrances too,
and even at the same moment I fell into much the same confused
division of mind between it and the better rooms to which I was
going, as I had been in so often between the forge and Miss
Havisham’s, and Biddy and Estella.
The sun had been shining brightly all day on the roof of my attic,
and the room was warm. As I put the window open and stood looking out, I saw Joe come slowly forth at the dark door below, and take
a turn or two in the air; and then I saw Biddy come, and bring him a
pipe and light it for him. He never smoked so late, and it seemed to
hint to me that he wanted comforting, for some reason or other.
He presently stood at the door, immediately beneath me, smoking
his pipe, and Biddy stood there too, quietly talking to him, and I
knew that they talked of me, for I heard my name mentioned in an
endearing tone by both of them more than once. I would not have
listened for more, if I could have heard more: so, I drew away from
the window, and sat down in my one chair by the bedside, feeling it
very sorrowful and strange that this first night of my bright fortunes
should be the loneliest I had ever known.
Looking towards the open window, I saw light wreaths from Joe’s
pipe floating there, and I fancied it was like a blessing from Joe––not
obtruded on me or paraded before me, but pervading the air we
132 Great Expectations
shared together. I put my light out, and crept into bed; and it was an
uneasy bed now, and I never slept the old sound sleep in it any more.
CHAPTER XIX
Morning made a considerable difference in my general prospect of
Life, and brightened it so much that it scarcely seemed the same.
What lay heaviest on my mind, was, the consideration that six days
intervened between me and the day of departure; for, I could not
divest myself of a misgiving that something might happen to London in the mean while, and that, when I got there, it would be either
greatly deteriorated or clean gone.
Joe and Biddy were very sympathetic and pleasant when I spoke of
our approaching separation; but they only referred to it when I did.
After breakfast, Joe brought out my indentures from the press in the
best parlour, and we put them in the fire, and I felt that I was free.
With all the novelty of my emancipation on me, I went to church
with Joe, and thought, perhaps the clergyman wouldn’t have read
that about the rich man and the kingdom of Heaven,* if he had
known all.
After our early dinner I strolled out alone, purposing to finish off
the marshes at once, and get them done with. As I passed the church,
I felt (as I had felt during service in the morning) a sublime compassion for the poor creatures who were destined to go there, Sunday
after Sunday, all their lives through, and to lie obscurely at last
among the low green mounds.* I promised myself that I would do
something for them one of these days, and formed a plan in outline
for bestowing a dinner of roast beef and plum-pudding, a pint of ale,
and a gallon of condescension, upon everybody in the village.
If I had often thought before, with something allied to shame, of
my companionship with the fugitive whom I had once seen limping
among those graves, what were my thoughts on this Sunday, when
the place recalled the wretch, ragged and shivering, with his felon
iron and badge! My comfort was, that it happened a long time ago,
and that he had doubtless been transported a long way off, and that
he was dead to me, and might be veritably dead into the bargain.
No more low wet grounds, no more dykes and sluices, no more of
these grazing cattle––though they seemed, in their dull manner, to
xix] Volume I Chapter XIX 133
wear a more respectful air now, and to face round, in order that they
might stare as long as possible at the possessor of such great
expectations––farewell, monotonous acquaintances of my childhood, henceforth I was for London and greatness: not for smith’s
work in general and for you! I made my exultant way to the old
Battery, and, lying down there to consider the question whether
Miss Havisham intended me for Estella, fell asleep.
When I awoke, I was much surprised to find Joe sitting beside me,
smoking his pipe. He greeted me with a cheerful smile on my opening my eyes, and said:
“As being the last time, Pip, I thought I’d foller.”
“And Joe, I am very glad you did so.”
“Thankee, Pip.”
“You may be sure, dear Joe,” I went on, after we had shaken
hands, “that I shall never forget you.”
“No, no, Pip!” said Joe, in a comfortable tone, “I ’m sure of that.
Ay, ay, old chap! Bless you, it were only necessary to get it well round
in a man’s mind, to be certain on it. But it took a bit of time to get it
well round, the change come so oncommon plump; didn’t it?”
Somehow, I was not best pleased with Joe’s being so mightily
secure of me. I should have liked him to have betrayed emotion, or to
have said, “It does you credit, Pip,” or something of that sort. Therefore, I made no remark on Joe’s first head: merely saying as to his
second, that the tidings had indeed come suddenly, but that I had
always wanted to be a gentleman, and had often and often speculated
on what I would do, if I were one.
“Have you though?” said Joe. “Astonishing!”
“It’s a pity now, Joe,” said I, “that you did not get on a little more,
when we had our lessons here; isn’t it?”
“Well, I don’t know,” returned Joe. “I’m so awful dull. I’m only
master of my own trade. It were always a pity as I was so awful dull;
but it’s no more of a pity now, than it was––this day twelvemonth––
don’t you see?”
What I had meant was, that when I came into my property and
was able to do something for Joe, it would have been much more
agreeable if he had been better qualified for a rise in station. He was
so perfectly innocent of my meaning, however, that I thought I
would mention it to Biddy in preference.
So, when we had walked home and had had tea, I took Biddy into
134 Great Expectations
our little garden by the side of the lane, and, after throwing out in a
general way for the elevation of her spirits, that I should never forget
her, said I had a favour to ask of her.
“And it is, Biddy,” said I, “that you will not omit any opportunity
of helping Joe on, a little.”
“How helping him on?” asked Biddy, with a steady sort of glance.
“Well! Joe is a dear good fellow––in fact, I think he is the dearest
fellow that ever lived––but he is rather backward in some things. For
instance, Biddy, in his learning and his manners.”
Although I was looking at Biddy as I spoke, and although she
opened her eyes very wide when I had spoken, she did not look at
me.
“Oh, his manners! Won’t his manners do then?” asked Biddy,
plucking a black currant leaf.
“My dear Biddy, they do very well here––––”
“Oh! they do very well here?” interposed Biddy, looking closely at
the leaf in her hand.
“Hear me out––but if I were to remove Joe into a higher sphere, as
I shall hope to remove him when I fully come into my property, they
would hardly do him justice.”
“And don’t you think he knows that?” asked Biddy.
It was such a very provoking question (for it had never in the most
distant manner occurred to me), that I said, snappishly, “Biddy, what
do you mean?”
Biddy having rubbed the leaf to pieces between her hands––and
the smell of a black currant bush has ever since recalled to me that
evening in the little garden by the side of the lane––said, “Have you
never considered that he may be proud?”
“Proud?” I repeated, with disdainful emphasis.
“Oh! there are many kinds of pride,” said Biddy, looking full at me
and shaking her head; “pride is not all of one kind––––”
“Well? What are you stopping for?” said I.
“Not all of one kind,” resumed Biddy. “He may be too proud to
let any one take him out of a place that he is competent to fill, and
fills well and with respect. To tell you the truth, I think he is: though
it sounds bold in me to say so, for you must know him far better than
I do.”
“Now, Biddy,” said I, “I am very sorry to see this in you. I did not
expect to see this in you. You are envious, Biddy, and grudging. You
xix] Volume I Chapter XIX 135
are dissatisfied on account of my rise in fortune, and you can’t help
showing it.”
“If you have the heart to think so,” returned Biddy, “say so. Say so
over and over again, if you have the heart to think so.”
“If you have the heart to be so, you mean, Biddy,” said I, in a
virtuous and superior tone; “don’t put it off upon me. I am very
sorry to see it, and it’s a––it’s a bad side of human nature. I did
intend to ask you to use any little opportunities you might have after
I was gone, of improving dear Joe. But after this, I ask you nothing. I
am extremely sorry to see this in you, Biddy,” I repeated. “It’s a––it’s
a bad side of human nature.”
“Whether you scold me or approve of me,” returned poor Biddy,
“you may equally depend upon my trying to do all that lies in my
power, here, at all times. And whatever opinion you take away of me,
shall make no difference in my remembrance of you. Yet a gentleman
should not be unjust neither,” said Biddy, turning away her head.
I again warmly repeated that it was a bad side of human nature (in
which sentiment, waiving its application, I have since seen reason to
think I was right), and I walked down the little path away from
Biddy, and Biddy went into the house, and I went out at the garden
gate and took a dejected stroll until supper-time; again feeling it very
sorrowful and strange that this, the second night of my bright fortunes, should be as lonely and unsatisfactory as the first.
But, morning once more brightened my view, and I extended my
clemency to Biddy, and we dropped the subject. Putting on the best
clothes I had, I went into town as early as I could hope to find the
shops open, and presented myself before Mr. Trabb, the tailor: who
was having his breakfast in the parlour behind his shop, and who did
not think it worth his while to come out to me, but called me in to
him.
“Well!” said Mr. Trabb, in a hail-fellow-well-met kind of way.
“How are you, and what can I do for you?”
Mr. Trabb had sliced his hot roll into three feather beds, and was
slipping butter in between the blankets, and covering it up. He was a
prosperous old bachelor, and his open window looked into a prosperous little garden and orchard, and there was a prosperous iron
safe let into the wall at the side of his fireplace, and I did not doubt
that heaps of his prosperity were put away in it in bags.
“Mr. Trabb,” said I, “it’s an unpleasant thing to have to mention,
136 Great Expectations
because it looks like boasting; but I have come into a handsome
property.”
A change passed over Mr. Trabb. He forgot the butter in bed, got
up from the bedside, and wiped his fingers on the tablecloth,
exclaiming, “Lord bless my soul!”
“I am going up to my guardian in London,” said I, casually drawing some guineas out of my pocket and looking at them; “and I want
a fashionable suit of clothes to go in. I wish to pay for them,” I
added––otherwise I thought he might only pretend to make them,
“with ready money.”
“My dear sir,” said Mr. Trabb, as he respectfully bent his body,
opened his arms, and took the liberty of touching me on the outside
of each elbow, “don’t hurt me by mentioning that. May I venture to
congratulate you? Would you do me the favour of stepping into the
shop?”
Mr. Trabb’s boy was the most audacious boy in all that countryside. When I had entered he was sweeping the shop, and he had
sweetened his labours by sweeping over me. He was still sweeping
when I came out into the shop with Mr. Trabb, and he knocked the
broom against all possible corners and obstacles, to express (as I
understood it) equality with any blacksmith, alive or dead.
“Hold that noise,” said Mr. Trabb, with the greatest sternness, “or
I’ll knock your head off! Do me the favour to be seated, sir. Now,
this,” said Mr. Trabb, taking down a roll of cloth, and tiding it out in
a flowing manner over the counter, preparatory to getting his hand
under it to show the gloss, “is a very sweet article. I can recommend
it for your purpose, sir, because it really is extra super. But you shall
see some others. Give me Number Four, you!” (To the boy, and with
a dreadfully severe stare: foreseeing the danger of that miscreant’s
brushing me with it, or making some other sign of familiarity.)
Mr. Trabb never removed his stern eye from the boy until he had
deposited number four on the counter and was at a safe distance
again. Then, he commanded him to bring number five, and number
eight. “And let me have none of your tricks here,” said Mr. Trabb,
“or you shall repent it, you young scoundrel, the longest day you
have to live.”
Mr. Trabb then bent over number four, and in a sort of deferential
confidence recommended it to me as a light article for summer wear,
an article much in vogue among the nobility and gentry, an article
xix] Volume I Chapter XIX 137
that it would ever be an honour to him to reflect upon a distinguished fellow-townsman’s (if he might claim me for a fellowtownsman) having worn. “Are you bringing numbers five and eight,
you vagabond,” said Mr. Trabb to the boy after that, “or shall I kick
you out of the shop and bring them myself ?”
I selected the material for a suit, with the assistance of Mr.
Trabb’s judgment, and re-entered the parlour to be measured. For,
although Mr. Trabb had my measure already, and had previously
been quite contented with it, he said apologetically that it “wouldn’t
do under existing circumstances, sir––wouldn’t do at all.” So, Mr.
Trabb measured and calculated me, in the parlour, as if I were an
estate and he the finest species of surveyor, and gave himself such a
world of trouble that I felt that no suit of clothes could possibly
remunerate him for his pains. When he had at last done and had
appointed to send the articles to Mr. Pumblechook’s on the Thursday evening, he said, with his hand upon the parlour lock, “I know,
sir, that London gentlemen cannot be expected to patronise local
work, as a rule; but if you would give me a turn now and then in the
quality of a townsman, I should greatly esteem it. Good morning, sir,
much obliged.––Door!”
The last word was flung at the boy, who had not the least notion
what it meant. But I saw him collapse as his master rubbed me out
with his hands, and my first decided experience of the stupendous
power of money, was, that it had morally laid upon his back, Trabb’s
boy.
After this memorable event, I went to the hatter’s, and the bootmaker’s, and the hosier’s, and felt rather like Mother Hubbard’s
dog* whose outfit required the services of so many trades. I also went
to the coach-office and took my place for seven o’clock on Saturday
morning. It was not necessary to explain everywhere that I had come
into a handsome property; but whenever I said anything to that
effect, it followed that the officiating tradesman ceased to have his
attention diverted through the window by the High-street, and concentrated his mind upon me. When I had ordered everything I wanted, I directed my steps towards Pumblechook’s, and, as I approached
that gentleman’s place of business, I saw him standing at his door.
He was waiting for me with great impatience. He had been out
early with the chaise-cart, and had called at the forge and heard the
news. He had prepared a collation for me in the Barnwell parlour,
138 Great Expectations
and he too ordered his shopman to “come out of the gangway” as my
sacred person passed.
“My dear friend,” said Mr. Pumblechook, taking me by both
hands, when he and I and the collation were alone, “I give you joy of
your good fortune. Well deserved, well deserved!”
This was coming to the point, and I thought it a sensible way of
expressing himself.
“To think,” said Mr. Pumblechook, after snorting admiration at
me for some moments, “that I should have been the humble instrument of leading up to this, is a proud reward.”
I begged Mr. Pumblechook to remember that nothing was to be
ever said or hinted, on that point.
“My dear young friend,” said Mr. Pumblechook, “if you will
allow me to call you so––––”
I murmured “Certainly,” and Mr. Pumblechook took me by both
hands again, and communicated a movement to his waistcoat, which
had an emotional appearance, though it was rather low down, “My
dear young friend, rely upon my doing my little all in your absence,
by keeping the fact before the mind of Joseph.––Joseph!” said Mr.
Pumblechook, in the way of a compassionate adjuration. “Joseph!!
Joseph!!!” Thereupon he shook his head and tapped it, expressing
his sense of deficiency in Joseph.
“But my dear young friend,” said Mr. Pumblechook, “you must
be hungry, you must be exhausted. Be seated. Here is a chicken had
round from the Boar, here is a tongue had round from the Boar,
here’s one or two little things had round from the Boar, that I
hope you may not despise. But do I,” said Mr. Pumblechook,
getting up again the moment after he had sat down, “see afore me,
him as I ever sported with in his times of happy infancy? And may
I––may I––––?”
This May I, meant might he shake hands? I consented, and he was
fervent, and then sat down again.
“Here is wine,” said Mr. Pumblechook. “Let us drink, Thanks to
Fortune, and may she ever pick out her favourites with equal judgment! And yet I cannot,” said Mr. Pumblechook, getting up again,
“see afore me One––and likeways drink to One––without again
expressing––May I––may I ––––?”
I said he might, and he shook hands with me again, and emptied
his glass and turned it upside-down. I did the same; and if I had
xix] Volume I Chapter XIX 139
turned myself upside-down before drinking, the wine could not have
gone more direct to my head.
Mr. Pumblechook helped me to the liver wing,* and to the best
slice of tongue (none of those out-of-the-way No Thoroughfares of
Pork now), and took, comparatively speaking, no care of himself at
all. “Ah! poultry, poultry! You little thought,” said Mr. Pumblechook, apostrophising the fowl in the dish, “when you was a young
fledgling, what was in store for you. You little thought you was to be
refreshment beneath this humble roof for One as––Call it a weakness, if you will,” said Mr. Pumblechook, getting up again, “but may
I? may I––––?”
It began to be unnecessary to repeat the form of saying he might,
so he did it at once. How he ever did it so often without wounding
himself with my knife, I don’t know.
“And your sister,” he resumed, after a little steady eating, “which
had the honour of bringing you up by hand! It’s a sad picter, to
reflect that she’s no longer equal to fully understanding the honour.
May––––”
I saw he was about to come at me again, and I stopped him.
“We’ll drink her health,” said I.
“Ah!” cried Mr. Pumblechook, leaning back in his chair, quite
flaccid with admiration, “that’s the way you know ’em, sir!” (I don’t
know who Sir was, but he certainly was not I, and there was no third
person present); “that’s the way you know the noble minded, sir!
Ever forgiving and ever affable. It might,” said the servile Pumblechook, putting down his untasted glass in a hurry and getting up
again, “to a common person, have the appearance of repeating––but
may I––––?”
When he had done it, he resumed his seat and drank to my sister.
“Let us never be blind,” said Mr. Pumblechook, “to her faults of
temper, but it is to be hoped she meant well.”
At about this time, I began to observe that he was getting flushed
in the face; as to myself, I felt all face, steeped in wine and smarting.
I mentioned to Mr. Pumblechook that I wished to have my new
clothes sent to his house, and he was ecstatic on my so distinguishing
him. I mentioned my reason for desiring to avoid observation in the
village, and he lauded it to the skies. There was nobody but himself,
he intimated, worthy of my confidence, and––in short, might he?
Then he asked me tenderly if I remembered our boyish games at
140 Great Expectations
sums, and how we had gone together to have me bound apprentice,
and, in effect, how he had ever been my favourite fancy and my
chosen friend? If I had taken ten times as many glasses of wine as I
had, I should have known that he never had stood in that relation
towards me, and should in my heart of hearts have repudiated the
idea. Yet for all that, I remember feeling convinced that I had been
much mistaken in him, and that he was a sensible practical goodhearted prime fellow.
By degrees he fell to reposing such great confidence in me, as to
ask my advice in reference to his own affairs. He mentioned that
there was an opportunity for a great amalgamation and monopoly of
the corn and seed trade on those premises, if enlarged, such as had
never occurred before in that, or any other neighbourhood. What
alone was wanting to the realisation of a vast fortune, he considered
to be More Capital. Those were the two little words, more capital.
Now it appeared to him (Pumblechook) that if that capital were got
into the business, through a sleeping partner, sir––which sleeping
partner would have nothing to do but walk in, by self or deputy,
whenever he pleased, and examine the books––and walk in twice a
year and take his profits away in his pocket, to the tune of fifty per
cent––it appeared to him that that might be an opening for a young
gentleman of spirit combined with property, which would be worthy
of his attention. But what did I think? He had great confidence in my
opinion, and what did I think? I gave it as my opinion. “Wait a bit!”
The united vastness and distinctness of this view so struck him, that
he no longer asked if he might shake hands with me, but said he
really must––and did.
We drank all the wine, and Mr. Pumblechook pledged himself
over and over again to keep Joseph up to the mark (I don’t know
what mark), and to render me efficient and constant service (I don’t
know what service). He also made known to me for the first time in
my life, and certainly after having kept his secret wonderfully well,
that he had always said of me, “That boy is no common boy, and
mark me, his fortun’ will be no common fortun’.” He said with a
tearful smile that it was a singular thing to think of now, and I said so
too. Finally, I went out into the air, with a dim perception that there
was something unwonted in the conduct of the sunshine, and found
that I had slumberously got to the turnpike without having taken any
account of the road.
xix] Volume I Chapter XIX 141
There, I was roused by Mr. Pumblechook’s hailing me. He was a
long way down the sunny street, and was making expressive gestures
for me to stop. I stopped, and he came up breathless.
“No, my dear friend,” said he, when he had recovered wind for
speech. “Not if I can help it. This occasion shall not entirely pass
without that affability on your part.––May I, as an old friend and
well-wisher? May I?”
We shook hands for the hundredth time at least, and he ordered a
young carter out of my way with the greatest indignation. Then, he
blessed me and stood waving his hand to me until I had passed the
crook in the road; and then I turned into a field and had a long nap
under a hedge before I pursued my way home.
I had scant luggage to take with me to London, for little of the
little I possessed was adapted to my new station. But, I began packing that same afternoon, and wildly packed up things that I knew I
should want next morning, in a fiction that there was not a moment
to be lost.
So, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, passed; and on Friday
morning I went to Mr. Pumblechook’s, to put on my new clothes and
pay my visit to Miss Havisham. Mr. Pumblechook’s own room was
given up to me to dress in, and was decorated with clean towels
expressly for the event. My clothes were rather a disappointment, of
course. Probably every new and eagerly expected garment ever put
on since clothes came in, fell a trifle short of the wearer’s expectation. But after I had had my new suit on, some half an hour, and had
gone through an immensity of posturing with Mr. Pumblechook’s
very limited dressing-glass, in the futile endeavour to see my legs, it
seemed to fit me better. It being market morning at a neighbouring
town some ten miles off, Mr. Pumblechook was not at home. I had
not told him exactly when I meant to leave, and was not likely to
shake hands with him again before departing. This was all as it
should be, and I went out in my new array: fearfully ashamed of
having to pass the shopman, and suspicious after all that I was at a
personal disadvantage, something like Joe’s in his Sunday suit.
I went circuitously to Miss Havisham’s by all the back ways, and
rang at the bell constrainedly, on account of the stiff long fingers of
my gloves. Sarah Pocket came to the gate, and positively reeled back
when she saw me so changed; her walnut-shell countenance likewise,
turned from brown to green and yellow.
142 Great Expectations
“You?” said she. “You, good gracious! What do you want?”
“I am going to London, Miss Pocket,” said I, “and want to say
good-by to Miss Havisham.”
I was not expected, for she left me locked in the yard, while she
went to ask if I were to be admitted. After a very short delay, she
returned and took me up, staring at me all the way.
Miss Havisham was taking exercise in the room with the long
spread table, leaning on her crutch stick. The room was lighted as of
yore, and at the sound of our entrance, she stopped and turned. She
was then just abreast of the rotted bride-cake.
“Don’t go, Sarah,” she said. “Well, Pip?”
“I start for London, Miss Havisham, to-morrow,” I was exceedingly careful what I said, “and I thought you would kindly not mind
my taking leave of you.”
“This is a gay figure, Pip,” said she, making her crutch stick play
round me, as if she, the fairy godmother who had changed me, were
bestowing the finishing gift.
“I have come into such good fortune since I saw you last, Miss
Havisham,” I murmured. “And I am so grateful for it, Miss
Havisham!”
“Ay, ay!” said she, looking at the discomfited and envious Sarah,
with delight. “I have seen Mr. Jaggers. I have heard about it, Pip. So
you go to-morrow?”
“Yes, Miss Havisham.”
“And you are adopted by a rich person?”
“Yes, Miss Havisham.”
“Not named?”
“No, Miss Havisham.”
“And Mr. Jaggers is made your guardian?”
“Yes, Miss Havisham.”
She quite gloated on these questions and answers, so keen was her
enjoyment of Sarah Pocket’s jealous dismay. “Well!” she went on;
“you have a promising career before you. Be good––deserve it––
abide by Mr. Jaggers’s instructions.” She looked at me, and looked at
Sarah, and Sarah’s countenance wrung out of her watchful face a
cruel smile. “Good-by, Pip!––you will always keep the name of Pip,
you know.”
“Yes, Miss Havisham.”
“Good-by, Pip!”
xix] Volume I Chapter XIX 143
She stretched out her hand, and I went down on my knee and put
it to my lips. I had not considered how I should take leave of her; it
came naturally to me at the moment, to do this. She looked at Sarah
Pocket with triumph in her weird eyes, and so I left my fairy godmother, with both her hands on her crutch stick, standing in the
midst of the dimly lighted room beside the rotten bride-cake that
was hidden in cobwebs.
Sarah Pocket conducted me down, as if I were a ghost who must
be seen out. She could not get over my appearance, and was in the
last degree confounded. I said “Good-by, Miss Pocket;” but she
merely stared, and did not seem collected enough to know that I
had spoken. Clear of the house, I made the best of my way back to
Pumblechook’s, took off my new clothes, made them into a bundle,
and went back home in my older dress, carrying it––to speak the
truth, much more at my ease too, though I had the bundle to
carry.
And now, those six days which were to have run out so slowly, had
run out fast and were gone, and to-morrow looked me in the face
more steadily than I could look at it. As the six evenings had dwindled away, to five, to four, to three, or two, I had become more and
more appreciative of the society of Joe and Biddy. On this last evening, I dressed myself out in my new clothes, for their delight, and sat
in my splendour until bedtime. We had a hot supper on the occasion,
graced by the inevitable roast fowl, and we had some flip* to finish
with. We were all very low, and none the higher for pretending to be
in spirits.
I was to leave our village at five in the morning, carrying my little
hand-portmanteau, and I had told Joe that I wished to walk away all
alone. I am afraid––sore afraid––that this purpose originated in my
sense of the contrast there would be between me and Joe, if we went
to the coach together. I had pretended with myself that there was
nothing of this taint in the arrangement; but when I went up to my
little room on this last night, I felt compelled to admit that it might
be so, and had an impulse upon me to go down again and entreat Joe
to walk with me in the morning. I did not.
All night there were coaches in my broken sleep, going to wrong
places instead of to London, and having in the traces, now dogs, now
cats, now pigs, now men––never horses. Fantastic failures of journeys occupied me until the day dawned and the birds were singing.
144 Great Expectations
Then, I got up and partly dressed, and sat at the window to take a
last look out, and in taking it fell asleep.
Biddy was astir so early to get my breakfast, that, although I did
not sleep at the window an hour, I smelt the smoke of the kitchen fire
when I started up with a terrible idea that it must be late in the
afternoon. But long after that, and long after I had heard the clinking
of the teacups and was quite ready, I wanted the resolution to go
down stairs. After all, I remained up there, repeatedly unlocking and
unstrapping my small portmanteau and locking and strapping it up
again, until Biddy called to me that I was late.
It was a hurried breakfast with no taste in it. I got up from the
meal, saying with a sort of briskness, as if it had only just occurred to
me, “Well! I suppose I must be off!” and then I kissed my sister who
was laughing and nodding and shaking in her usual chair, and kissed
Biddy, and threw my arms around Joe’s neck. Then I took up my
little portmanteau and walked out. The last I saw of them, was, when
I presently heard a scuffle behind me, and looking back, saw Joe
throwing an old shoe after me* and Biddy throwing another old shoe.
I stopped then, to wave my hat, and dear old Joe waved his strong
right arm above his head, crying huskily “Hooroar!” and Biddy put
her apron to her face.
I walked away at a good pace, thinking it was easier to go than I
had supposed it would be, and reflecting that it would never have
done to have had an old shoe thrown after the coach, in sight of all
the High-street. I whistled and made nothing of going. But the
village was very peaceful and quiet, and the light mists were solemnly rising, as if to show me the world, and I had been so innocent
and little there, and all beyond was so unknown and great, that in a
moment with a strong heave and sob I broke into tears. It was by the
finger-post at the end of the village, and I laid my hand upon it, and
said, “Good-by O my dear, dear friend!”
Heaven knows we need never be ashamed of our tears, for they are
rain upon the blinding dust of earth, overlaying our hard hearts. I
was better after I had cried, than before––more sorry, more aware of
my own ingratitude, more gentle. If I had cried before, I should have
had Joe with me then.
So subdued I was by those tears, and by their breaking out again
in the course of the quiet walk, that when I was on the coach, and it
was clear of the town, I deliberated with an aching heart whether I
xix] Volume I Chapter XIX 145
would not get down when we changed horses, and walk back, and
have another evening at home, and a better parting. We changed, and
I had not made up my mind, and still reflected for my comfort that it
would be quite practicable to get down and walk back, when we
changed again. And while I was occupied with these deliberations, I
would fancy an exact resemblance to Joe in some man coming along
the road towards us, and my heart would beat high.––As if he could
possibly be there!
We changed again, and yet again, and it was now too late and too
far to go back, and I went on. And the mists had all solemnly risen
now, and the world lay spread before me.*

VOLUME II
CHAPTER I
The journey from our town to the metropolis, was a journey of
about five hours. It was a little past mid-day when the four-horse
stage-coach by which I was a passenger, got into the ravel of traffic
frayed out about the Cross Keys, Wood-street,* Cheapside, London.
We Britons had at that time particularly settled that it was treasonable to doubt our having and our being the best of everything:
otherwise, while I was scared by the immensity of London, I think I
might have had some faint doubts whether it was not rather ugly,
crooked, narrow, and dirty.
Mr. Jaggers had duly sent me his address; it was, Little Britain,
and he had written after it on his card, “just out of Smithfield,* and
close by the coach-office.” Nevertheless, a hackney-coachman, who
seemed to have as many capes to his greasy great-coat as he was years
old, packed me up in his coach and hemmed me in with a folding and
jingling barrier of steps, as if he were going to take me fifty miles.
His getting on his box, which I remember to have been decorated
with an old weather-stained pea-green hammercloth* motheaten
into rags, was quite a work of time. It was a wonderful equipage, with
six great coronets outside, and ragged things behind for I don’t know
how many footmen to hold on by, and a harrow* below them, to
prevent amateur footmen from yielding to the temptation.
I had scarcely had time to enjoy the coach and to think how like a
straw-yard it was, and yet how like a rag-shop,* and to wonder why
the horses’ nose-bags were kept inside, when I observed the coachman beginning to get down, as if we were going to stop presently.
And stop we presently did, in a gloomy street, at certain offices with
an open door, whereon was painted Mr. Jaggers.
“How much?” I asked the coachman.
The coachman answered, “A shilling––unless you wish to make it
more.”
I naturally said I had no wish to make it more.
“Then it must be a shilling,” observed the coachman. “I don’t
want to get into trouble. I know him!” He darkly closed an eye at Mr.
Jaggers’s name, and shook his head.
When he had got his shilling, and had in course of time completed
the ascent to his box, and had got away (which appeared to relieve his
mind), I went into the front office with my little portmanteau in my
hand and asked, Was Mr. Jaggers at home?
“He is not,” returned the clerk. “He is in Court at present. Am I
addressing Mr. Pip?”
I signified that he was addressing Mr. Pip.
“Mr. Jaggers left word would you wait in his room. He couldn’t
say how long he might be, having a case on. But it stands to reason,
his time being valuable, that he won’t be longer than he can help.”
With those words, the clerk opened a door, and ushered me into an
inner chamber at the back. Here, we found a gentleman with one eye,
in a velveteen suit and knee-breeches, who wiped his nose with his
sleeve on being interrupted in the perusal of the newspaper.
“Go and wait outside, Mike,” said the clerk.
I began to say that I hoped I was not interrupting––––when the
clerk shoved this gentleman out with as little ceremony as I ever saw
used, and tossing his fur cap out after him, left me alone.
Mr. Jaggers’s room was lighted by a skylight only, and was a most
dismal place; the skylight, eccentrically patched like a broken head,
and the distorted adjoining houses looking as if they had twisted
themselves to peep down at me through it. There were not so many
papers about, as I should have expected to see; and there were some
odd objects about, that I should not have expected to see––such as an
old rusty pistol, a sword in a scabbard, several strange-looking boxes
and packages, and two dreadful casts on a shelf, of faces peculiarly
swollen, and twitchy about the nose.* Mr. Jaggers’s own high-backed
chair was of deadly black horsehair, with rows of brass nails round it,
like a coffin; and I fancied I could see how he leaned back in it, and
bit his forefinger at the clients. The room was but small, and the
clients seemed to have had a habit of backing up against the wall: the
wall, especially opposite to Mr. Jaggers’s chair, being greasy with
shoulders. I recalled, too, that the one-eyed gentleman had shuffled
forth against the wall when I was the innocent cause of his being
turned out.
I sat down in the cliental chair placed over against Mr. Jaggers’s
chair, and became fascinated by the dismal atmosphere of the place. I
150 Great Expectations
called to mind that the clerk had the same air of knowing something
to everybody else’s disadvantage, as his master had. I wondered how
many other clerks there were up-stairs, and whether they all claimed
to have the same detrimental mastery of their fellow-creatures. I
wondered what was the history of all the odd litter about the room,
and how it came there. I wondered whether the two swollen faces
were of Mr. Jaggers’s family, and, if he were so unfortunate as to
have had a pair of such ill-looking relations, why he stuck them on
that dusty perch for the blacks and flies to settle on, instead of giving
them a place at home. Of course I had no experience of a London
summer day, and my spirits may have been oppressed by the hot
exhausted air, and by the dust and grit that lay thick on everything.
But I sat wondering and waiting in Mr. Jaggers’s close room, until I
really could not bear the two casts on the shelf above Mr. Jaggers’s
chair, and got up and went out.
When I told the clerk that I would take a turn in the air while I
waited, he advised me to go round the corner and I should come into
Smithfield. So, I came into Smithfield; and the shameful place, being
all asmear with filth and fat and blood and foam, seemed to stick to
me. So, I rubbed it off with all possible speed by turning into a street
where I saw the great black dome of Saint Paul’s bulging at me from
behind a grim stone building which a bystander said was Newgate
Prison. Following the wall of the jail, I found the roadway covered
with straw to deaden the noise of passing vehicles; and from this, and
from the quantity of people standing about, smelling strongly of
spirits and beer, I inferred that the trials* were on.
While I looked about me here, an exceedingly dirty and partially
drunk minister of justice* asked me if I would like to step in and
hear a trial or so: informing me that he could give me a front place
for half-a-crown, whence I should command a full view of the Lord
Chief Justice in his wig and robes––mentioning that awful personage
like waxwork, and presently offering him at the reduced price of
eighteenpence. As I declined the proposal on the plea of an appointment, he was so good as to take me into a yard and show me where
the gallows was kept, and also where people were publicly whipped,
and then he showed me the Debtors’ Door, out of which culprits
came to be hanged:* heightening the interest of that dreadful portal
by giving me to understand that “four on ’em” would come out at
that door the day after to-morrow at eight in the morning, to be
xx] Volume II Chapter I 151
killed in a row. This was horrible, and gave me a sickening idea of
London: the more so as the Lord Chief Justice’s proprietor wore
(from his hat down to his boots and up again to his pockethandkerchief inclusive) mildewed clothes, which had evidently not
belonged to him originally, and which, I took it into my head, he had
bought cheap of the executioner.* Under these circumstances I
thought myself well rid of him for a shilling.
I dropped into the office to ask if Mr. Jaggers had come in yet, and
I found he had not, and I strolled out again. This time, I made the
tour of Little Britain, and turned into Bartholomew Close; and now I
became aware that other people were waiting about for Mr. Jaggers,
as well as I. There were two men of secret appearance lounging in
Bartholomew Close, and thoughtfully fitting their feet into the
cracks of the pavement as they talked together, one of whom said to
the other when they first passed me, that “Jaggers would do it if it
was to be done.” There was a knot of three men and two women
standing at a corner, and one of the women was crying on her dirty
shawl, and the other comforted her by saying, as she pulled her own
shawl over her shoulders, “Jaggers is for him, ’Melia, and what more
could you have?” There was a red-eyed little Jew who came into the
Close while I was loitering there, in company with a second little Jew
whom he sent upon an errand; and while the messenger was gone, I
remarked this Jew, who was of a highly excitable temperament, performing a jig of anxiety under a lamp-post, and accompanying himself, in a kind of frenzy, with the words, “Oh Jaggerth, Jaggerth,
Jaggerth! all otherth ith Cag-Maggerth,* give me Jaggerth!” These
testimonies to the popularity of my guardian made a deep impression on me, and I admired and wondered more than ever.
At length, as I was looking out at the iron gate of Bartholomew
Close into Little Britain, I saw Mr. Jaggers coming across the road
towards me. All the others who were waiting, saw him at the same
time, and there was quite a rush at him. Mr. Jaggers, putting a hand
on my shoulder and walking with me at his side without saying
anything to me, addressed himself to his followers.
First, he took the two secret men.
“Now, I have nothing to say to you,” said Mr. Jaggers, throwing
his finger at them. “I want to know no more than I know. As to the
result, it’s a toss-up. I told you from the first it was a toss-up. Have
you paid Wemmick?”
152 Great Expectations
“We made the money up this morning, sir,” said one of the men,
submissively, while the other perused Mr Jaggers’s face.
“I don’t ask you when you made it up, or where, or whether you
made it up at all. Has Wemmick got it?”
“Yes, sir,” said both the men together.
“Very well; then you may go. Now, I won’t have it!” said Mr.
Jaggers, waving his hand at them to put them behind him. “If you
say a word to me, I’ll throw up the case.”
“We thought, Mr. Jaggers––––” one of the men began, pulling off
his hat.
“That’s what I told you not to do,” said Mr. Jaggers. “You
thought! I think for you; that’s enough for you. If I want you, I
know where to find you; I don’t want you to find me. Now I won’t
have it. I won’t hear a word.”
The two men looked at one another as Mr. Jaggers waved
them behind again, and humbly fell back and were heard no
more.
“And now you!” said Mr. Jaggers, suddenly stopping, and turning on the two women with the shawls, from whom the three
men had meekly separated.––“Oh! Amelia, is it?”
“Yes, Mr. Jaggers.”
“And do you remember,” retorted Mr. Jaggers, “that but for me
you wouldn’t be here and couldn’t be here?”
“Oh yes, sir!” exclaimed both women together. “Lord bless you,
sir, well we knows that!”
“Then why,” said Mr. Jaggers, “do you come here?”
“My Bill, sir!” the crying woman pleaded.
“Now, I tell you what!” said Mr. Jaggers. “Once for all. If you
don’t know that your Bill’s in good hands, I know it. And if you
come here, bothering about your Bill, I’ll make an example of both
your Bill and you, and let him slip through my fingers. Have you
paid Wemmick?”
“Oh yes, sir! Every farden.”*
“Very well. Then you have done all you have got to do. Say
another word––one single word––and Wemmick shall give you your
money back.”
This terrible threat caused the two women to fall off immediately.
No one remained now but the excitable Jew, who had already raised
the skirts of Mr Jaggers’s coat to his lips several times.
xx] Volume II Chapter I 153
“I don’t know this man!” said Mr. Jaggers, in the same devastating
strain. “What does this fellow want?”
“Ma thear Mithter Jaggerth. Hown brother to Habraham
Latharuth!”
“Who’s he?” said Mr. Jaggers. “Let go of my coat.”
The suitor, kissing the hem of the garment again before relinquishing it, replied, “Habraham Latharuth, on thuthpithion of
plate.”*
“You’re too late,” said Mr. Jaggers. “I am over the way.”*
“Holy father, Mithter Jaggerth!” cried my excitable acquaintance,
turning white, “don’t thay you’re again Habraham Latharuth!”
“I am,” said Mr. Jaggers, “and there’s an end of it. Get out of the
way.”
“Mithter Jaggerth! Half a moment! My hown cuthen’th gone to
Mithter Wemmick at thith prethent minute, to hoffer him hany
termth. Mithter Jaggerth! Half a quarter of a moment! If you’d
have the condethenthun to be bought off from the t’other thide––at
hany thuperior prithe!––money no object!––Mithter Jaggerth––
Mithter––––!”
My guardian threw his supplicant off with supreme indifference,
and left him dancing on the pavement as if it were red-hot. Without
further interruption, we reached the front office, where we found the
clerk and the man in velveteen with the fur cap.
“Here’s Mike,” said the clerk, getting down from his stool, and
approaching Mr. Jaggers confidentially.
“Oh!” said Mr. Jaggers, turning to the man, who was pulling a
lock of hair in the middle of his forehead, like the Bull in Cock
Robin* pulling at the bell-rope; “your man comes on this afternoon.
Well?”
“Well, Mas’r Jaggers,” returned Mike, in the voice of a sufferer
from a constitutional cold; “arter a deal o’ trouble, I’ve found one,
sir, as might do.”
“What is he prepared to swear?”
“Well, Mas’r Jaggers,” said Mike, wiping his nose on his fur cap
this time; “in a general way, anythink.”
Mr. Jaggers suddenly became most irate. “Now, I warned you
before,” said he, throwing his forefinger at the terrified client, “that
if you ever presumed to talk in that way here, I’d make an example of
you. You infernal scoundrel, how dare you tell me that?”
154 Great Expectations
The client looked scared, but bewildered too, as if he were
unconscious what he had done.
“Spooney!” said the clerk, in a low voice, giving him a stir with his
elbow. “Soft Head! Need you say it face to face?”
“Now, I ask you, you blundering booby,” said my guardian, very
sternly, “once more and for the last time, what the man you have
brought here is prepared to swear?”
Mike looked hard at my guardian, as if he were trying to learn a
lesson from his face, and slowly replied, “Ayther to character, or to
having been in his company and never left him all the night in
question.”
“Now, be careful. In what station of life is this man?”
Mike looked at his cap, and looked at the floor, and looked at the
ceiling, and looked at the clerk, and even looked at me, before beginning to reply in a nervous manner, “We’ve dressed him up like––––”
when my guardian blustered out:
“What? You will, will you?”
(“Spooney!”* added the clerk again, with another stir.)
After some helpless casting about, Mike brightened and began
again:
“He is dressed like a ’spectable pieman. A sort of a pastry-cook.”
“Is he here?” asked my guardian.
“I left him,” said Mike, “a settin on some door-steps round the
corner.”
“Take him past that window, and let me see him.”
The window indicated, was the office window. We all three went
to it, behind the wire blind, and presently saw the client go by in an
accidental manner, with a murderous-looking tall individual, in a
short suit of white linen and a paper cap. This guileless confectioner
was not by any means sober, and had a black eye in the green stage of
recovery, which was painted over.
“Tell him to take his witness away directly,” said my guardian to
the clerk, in extreme disgust, “and ask him what he means by bringing such a fellow as that.”
My guardian then took me into his own room, and while he
lunched, standing, from a sandwich-box and a pocket-flask of sherry
(he seemed to bully his very sandwich as he ate it), informed me
what arrangements he had made for me. I was to go to “Barnard’s
Inn”* to young Mr. Pocket’s rooms, where a bed had been sent in for
xx] Volume II Chapter I 155
my accommodation; I was to remain with young Mr. Pocket until
Monday; on Monday I was to go with him to his father’s house on a
visit, that I might try how I liked it. Also, I was told what my allowance
was to be––it was a very liberal one––and had handed to me from one
of my guardian’s drawers, the cards of certain tradesmen with whom I
was to deal for all kinds of clothes, and such other things as I could
in reason want. “You will find your credit good, Mr. Pip,” said my
guardian, whose flask of sherry smelt like a whole cask-full, as he
hastily refreshed himself, “but I shall by this means be able to check
your bills, and to pull you up if I find you outrunning the constable.*
Of course you’ll go wrong somehow, but that’s no fault of mine.”
After I had pondered a little over this encouraging sentiment, I
asked Mr. Jaggers if I could send for a coach? He said it was not
worth while, I was so near my destination; Wemmick should walk
round with me, if I pleased.
I then found that Wemmick was the clerk in the next room.
Another clerk was rung down from up-stairs to take his place while
he was out, and I accompanied him into the street, after shaking
hands with my guardian. We found a new set of people lingering
outside, but Wemmick made a way among them by saying coolly yet
decisively; “I tell you it’s no use; he won’t have a word to say to one
of you;” and we soon got clear of them, and went on side by side.
CHAPTER II
Casting my eyes on Mr. Wemmick as we went along, to see what he
was like in the light of day, I found him to be a dry man, rather short
in stature, with a square wooden face, whose expression seemed to
have been imperfectly chipped out with a dull-edged chisel. There
were some marks in it that might have been dimples, if the material
had been softer and the instrument finer, but which, as it was, were
only dints. The chisel had made three or four of these attempts at
embellishment over his nose, but had given them up without an
effort to smooth them off. I judged him to be a bachelor from the
frayed condition of his linen, and he appeared to have sustained a
good many bereavements; for, he wore at least four mourning rings,
besides a brooch representing a lady and a weeping willow at a tomb
with an urn on it. I noticed, too, that several rings and seals hung at
156 Great Expectations
his watch-chain, as if he were quite laden with remembrances of
departed friends. He had glittering eyes––small, keen, and black––
and thin wide mottled lips. He had had them, to the best of my
belief, from forty to fifty years.
“So you were never in London before?” said Mr. Wemmick to me.
“No,” said I.
“I was new here once,” said Mr. Wemmick. “Rum to think of
now!”
“You are well acquainted with it now?”
“Why, yes,” said Mr. Wemmick. “I know the moves of it.”
“Is it a very wicked place?” I asked, more for the sake of saying
something than for information.
“You may get cheated, robbed, and murdered, in London. But
there are plenty of people anywhere, who’ll do that for you.”
“If there is bad blood between you and them,” said I, to soften it
off a little.
“Oh! I don’t know about bad blood,” returned Mr. Wemmick;
“there’s not much bad blood about. They’ll do it, if there’s anything
to be got by it.”
“That makes it worse.”
“You think so?” returned Mr. Wemmick. “Much about the same,
I should say.”
He wore his hat on the back of his head, and looked straight before
him: walking in a self-contained way as if there were nothing in the
streets to claim his attention. His mouth was such a post-office of a
mouth* that he had a mechanical appearance of smiling. We had
got to the top of Holborn Hill before I knew that it was merely a
mechanical appearance, and that he was not smiling at all.
“Do you know where Mr. Matthew Pocket lives?” I asked Mr.
Wemmick.
“Yes,” said he, nodding in the direction. “At Hammersmith, west
of London.”
“Is that far?”
“Well! Say five miles.”
“Do you know him?”
“Why, you’re a regular cross-examiner!” said Mr. Wemmick, looking at me with an approving air. “Yes, I know him. I know him!”
There was an air of toleration or depreciation about his utterance
of these words, that rather depressed me; and I was still looking
xxi] Volume II Chapter II 157
sideways at his block of a face in search of any encouraging note to
the text, when he said here we were at Barnard’s Inn. My depression was not alleviated by the announcement, for, I had supposed
that establishment to be an hotel kept by Mr Barnard, to which the
Blue Boar in our town was a mere public-house. Whereas I now
found Barnard to be a disembodied spirit, or a fiction, and his inn the
dingiest collection of shabby buildings ever squeezed together in a
rank corner as a club for Tom-cats.
We entered this haven through a wicket-gate, and were disgorged
by an introductory passage into a melancholy little square that
looked to me like a flat burying-ground. I thought it had the most
dismal trees in it, and the most dismal sparrows, and the most dismal
cats, and the most dismal houses (in number half a dozen or so), that
I had ever seen. I thought the windows of the sets of chambers into
which these houses were divided, were in every stage of dilapidated
blind and curtain, crippled flower-pot, cracked glass, dusty decay,
and miserable makeshift; while To Let To Let To Let, glared at me
from empty rooms, as if no new wretches ever came there, and the
vengeance of the soul of Barnard were being slowly appeased by the
gradual suicide of the present occupants and their unholy interment
under the gravel. A frouzy mourning of soot and smoke attired this
forlorn creation of Barnard, and it had strewn ashes on its head, and
was undergoing penance and humiliation as a mere dust-hole. Thus
far my sense of sight; while dry rot and wet rot and all the silent rots
that rot in neglected roof and cellar––rot of rat and mouse and bug
and coaching-stables near at hand besides––addressed themselves
faintly to my sense of smell, and moaned, “Try Barnard’s Mixture.”
So imperfect was this realisation of the first of my great expectations, that I looked in dismay at Mr. Wemmick. “Ah!” said he,
mistaking me; “the retirement reminds you of the country. So it does
me.”
He led me into a corner and conducted me up a flight of stairs––
which appeared to me to be slowly collapsing into sawdust, so that
one of these days the upper lodgers would look out at their doors and
find themselves without the means of coming down––to a set of
chambers on the top floor. Mr. Pocket, Jun., was painted on the
door, and there was a label on the letter-box, “Return shortly.”
“He hardly thought you’d come so soon,” Mr. Wemmick
explained. “You don’t want me any more?”
158 Great Expectations
“No, thank you,” said I.
“As I keep the cash,” Mr. Wemmick observed, “we shall most
likely meet pretty often. Good day.”
“Good day.”
I put out my hand, and Mr. Wemmick at first looked at it as if he
thought I wanted something. Then he looked at me, and said correcting himself,
“To be sure! Yes. You’re in the habit of shaking hands?”
I was rather confused, thinking it must be out of the London
fashion, but said yes.
“I have got so out of it!” said Mr. Wemmick––“except at last.*
Very glad, I’m sure, to make your acquaintance. Good day!”
When we had shaken hands and he was gone, I opened the staircase window and had nearly beheaded myself, for, the lines had
rotted away, and it came down like the guillotine. Happily it was so
quick that I had not put my head out. After this escape, I was content
to take a foggy view of the Inn through the window’s encrusting dirt
and to stand dolefully looking out, saying to myself that London was
decidedly overrated.
Mr. Pocket, Junior’s, idea of Shortly was not mine, for I had
nearly maddened myself with looking out for half an hour, and had
written my name with my finger several times in the dirt of every
pane in the window, before I heard footsteps on the stairs. Gradually
there arose before me the hat, head, neckcloth, waistcoat, trousers,
boots, of a member of society of about my own standing. He had a
paper-bag under each arm and a pottle of strawberries in one hand,
and was out of breath.
“Mr. Pip?” said he.
“Mr. Pocket?” said I.
“Dear me!” he exclaimed. “I am extremely sorry; but I knew there
was a coach from your part of the country at mid-day, and I thought
you would come by that one. The fact is, I have been out on your
account––not that that is any excuse––for I thought, coming from
the country, you might like a little fruit after dinner, and I went to
Covent Garden Market to get it good.”
For a reason that I had, I felt as if my eyes would start out of my
head. I acknowledged his attention incoherently, and began to think
this was a dream.
“Dear me!” said Mr. Pocket, Junior. “This door sticks so!”
xxi] Volume II Chapter II 159
As he was fast making jam of his fruit by wrestling with the door
while the paper-bags were under his arms, I begged him to allow me
to hold them. He relinquished them with an agreeable smile, and
combated with the door as if it were a wild beast. It yielded so
suddenly at last, that he staggered back upon me, and I staggered
back upon the opposite door, and we both laughed. But still I felt as
if my eyes must start out of my head, and as if this must be a dream.
“Pray come in,” said Mr. Pocket, Junior. “Allow me to lead the
way. I am rather bare here, but I hope you’ll be able to make out
tolerably well till Monday. My father thought you would get on more
agreeably through to-morrow with me than with him, and might like
to take a walk about London. I am sure I shall be very happy to show
London to you. As to our table, you won’t find that bad, I hope, for it
will be supplied from our coffee-house here, and (it is only right I
should add) at your expense, such being Mr. Jaggers’s directions. As
to our lodging, it’s not by any means splendid, because I have my
own bread to earn, and my father hasn’t anything to give me, and I
shouldn’t be willing to take it, if he had. This is our sitting-room––
just such chairs and tables and carpet and so forth, you see, as they
could spare from home. You mustn’t give me credit for the tablecloth
and spoons and castors, because they come for you from the coffeehouse. This is my little bedroom; rather musty, but Barnard’s is
musty. This is your bedroom; the furniture’s hired for the occasion,
but I trust it will answer the purpose; if you should want anything,
I’ll go and fetch it. The chambers are retired, and we shall be alone
together, but we shan’t fight, I dare say. But, dear me, I beg your
pardon, you’re holding the fruit all this time. Pray let me take these
bags from you. I am quite ashamed.”
As I stood opposite to Mr. Pocket, Junior, delivering him the bags,
One, Two, I saw the starting appearance come into his own eyes that
I knew to be in mine, and he said falling back:
“Lord bless me, you’re the prowling boy!”
“And you,” said I, “are the pale young gentleman!”
160 Great Expectations
CHAPTER III
The pale young gentleman and I stood contemplating one another
in Barnard’s Inn until we both burst out laughing. “The idea of its
being you!” said he. “The idea of its being you!” said I. And then we
contemplated one another afresh, and laughed again. “Well!” said
the pale young gentleman, reaching out his hand good humouredly,
“it’s all over now, I hope, and it will be magnanimous in you if you’ll
forgive me for having knocked you about so.”
I derived from this speech that Mr. Herbert Pocket (for Herbert
was the pale young gentleman’s name) still rather confounded his
intention with his execution. But I made a modest reply, and we
shook hands warmly.
“You hadn’t come into your good fortune at that time?” said
Herbert Pocket.
“No,” said I.
“No,” he acquiesced: “I heard it had happened very lately. I was
rather on the look-out for good fortune then.”
“Indeed?”
“Yes. Miss Havisham had sent for me, to see if she could take a
fancy to me. But she couldn’t––at all events, she didn’t.”
I thought it polite to remark that I was surprised to hear that.
“Bad taste,” said Herbert, laughing, “but a fact. Yes, she had sent
for me on a trial visit, and if I had come out of it successfully, I
suppose I should have been provided for; perhaps I should have been
what-you-may-called it to Estella.”
“What’s that?” I asked, with sudden gravity.
He was arranging his fruit in plates while we talked, which divided his attention, and was the cause of his having made this lapse of
a word. “Affianced,” he explained, still busy with the fruit.
“Betrothed. Engaged. What’s-his-named. Any word of that sort.”
“How did you bear your disappointment?” I asked.
“Pooh!” said he, “I didn’t care much for it. She’s a Tartar.”
“Miss Havisham?” I suggested.
“I don’t say no to that, but I meant Estella. That girl’s hard and
haughty and capricious to the last degree, and has been brought up
by Miss Havisham to wreak revenge on all the male sex.”
“What relation is she to Miss Havisham?”
xxii] Volume II Chapter III 161
“None,” said he. “Only adopted.”
“Why should she wreak revenge on all the male sex? What
revenge?”
“Lord, Mr. Pip!” said he. “Don’t you know?”
“No,” said I.
“Dear me! It’s quite a story, and shall be saved till dinner-time.
And now let me take the liberty of asking you a question. How did
you come there, that day?”
I told him, and he was attentive until I had finished, and then
burst out laughing again, and asked me if I was sore afterwards? I
didn’t ask him if he was, for my conviction on that point was perfectly established.
“Mr. Jaggers is your guardian, I understand?” he went on.
“Yes.”
“You know he is Miss Havisham’s man of business and solicitor,
and has her confidence when nobody else has?”
This was bringing me (I felt) towards dangerous ground. I
answered with a constraint I made no attempt to disguise, that I had
seen Mr. Jaggers in Miss Havisham’s house on the very day of our
combat, but never at any other time, and that I believed he had no
recollection of having ever seen me there.
“He was so obliging as to suggest my father for your tutor, and he
called on my father to propose it. Of course he knew about my father
from his connexion with Miss Havisham. My father is Miss Havisham’s cousin; not that that implies familiar intercourse between
them, for he is a bad courtier and will not propitiate her.”
Herbert Pocket had a frank and easy way with him that was very
taking. I had never seen anyone then, and I have never seen anyone
since, who more strongly expressed to me, in every look and tone, a
natural incapacity to do anything secret and mean. There was something wonderfully hopeful about his general air, and something that
at the same time whispered to me he would never be very successful
or rich. I don’t know how this was. I became imbued with the notion
on that first occasion before we sat down to dinner, but I cannot
define by what means.
He was still a pale young gentleman, and had a certain conquered
languor about him in the midst of his spirits and briskness, that did
not seem indicative of natural strength. He had not a handsome face,
but it was better than handsome: being extremely amiable and cheer162 Great Expectations
ful. His figure was a little ungainly, as in the days when my knuckles
had taken such liberties with it, but it looked as if it would always be
light and young. Whether Mr. Trabb’s local work would have sat
more gracefully on him than on me, may be a question; but I am
conscious that he carried off his rather old clothes, much better than
I carried off my new suit.
As he was so communicative, I felt that reserve on my part would
be a bad return unsuited to our years. I therefore told him my small
story, and laid stress on my being forbidden to inquire who my
benefactor was. I further mentioned that as I had been brought up a
blacksmith in a country place, and knew very little of the ways of
politeness, I would take it as a great kindness in him if he would give
me a hint whenever he saw me at a loss or going wrong.
“With pleasure,” said he, “though I venture to prophesy that
you’ll want very few hints. I dare say we shall be often together, and I
should like to banish any needless restraint between us. Will you do
me the favour to begin at once to call me by my christian name,
Herbert?”
I thanked him, and said I would. I informed him in exchange that
my christian name was Philip.
“I don’t take to Philip,” said he, smiling, “for it sounds like a
moral boy out of the spelling-book,* who was so lazy that he fell into
a pond, or so fat that he couldn’t see out of his eyes, or so avaricious
that he locked up his cake till the mice ate it, or so determined to go a
birds’-nesting that he got himself eaten by bears who lived handy in
the neighbourhood. I tell you what I should like. We are so harmonious, and you have been a blacksmith––would you mind it?”
“I shouldn’t mind anything that you propose,” I answered, “but I
don’t understand you.”
“Would you mind Handel for a familiar name? There’s a charming piece of music by Handel, called the Harmonious Blacksmith.”*
“I should like it very much.”
“Then, my dear Handel,” said he, turning round as the door
opened, “here is the dinner, and I must beg of you to take the top of
the table, because the dinner is of your providing.”
This I would not hear of, so he took the top, and I faced him. It
was a nice little dinner––seemed to me then, a very Lord Mayor’s
Feast*––and it acquired additional relish from being eaten under
those independent circumstances, with no old people by, and with
xxii] Volume II Chapter III 163
London all around us. This again was heightened by a certain gipsy
character that set the banquet off: for, while the table was, as Mr.
Pumblechook might have said, the lap of luxury––being entirely
furnished forth from the coffee-house––the circumjacent region of
sitting-room was of a comparatively pastureless and shifty character:
imposing on the waiter the wandering habits of putting the covers on
the floor (where he fell over them), the melted butter in the armchair, the bread on the bookshelves, the cheese in the coal-scuttle,
and the boiled fowl into my bed in the next room––where I found
much of its parsley and butter in a state of congelation when I retired
for the night. All this made the feast delightful, and when the waiter
was not there to watch me, my pleasure was without alloy.
We had made some progress in the dinner, when I reminded
Herbert of his promise to tell me about Miss Havisham.
“True,” he replied. “I’ll redeem it at once. Let me introduce the
topic, Handel, by mentioning that in London it is not the custom to
put the knife in the mouth––for fear of accidents––and that while
the fork is reserved for that use, it is not put further in than is
necessary. It is scarcely worth mentioning, only it’s as well to do as
other people do. Also, the spoon is not generally used over-hand, but
under. This has two advantages. You get at your mouth better (which
after all is the object), and you save a good deal of the attitude of
opening oysters, on the part of the right elbow.”
He offered these friendly suggestions in such a lively way, that we
both laughed and I scarcely blushed.
“Now,” he pursued, “concerning Miss Havisham. Miss Havisham, you must know, was a spoilt child. Her mother died when
she was a baby, and her father denied her nothing. Her father was
a country gentleman down in your part of the world, and was a
brewer. I don’t know why it should be a crack thing to be a brewer;
but it is indisputable that while you cannot possibly be genteel
and bake, you may be as genteel as never was and brew. You see it
every day.”
“Yet a gentleman may not keep a public-house; may he?” said I.
“Not on any account,” returned Herbert; “but a public-house
may keep a gentleman.* Well! Mr. Havisham was very rich and very
proud. So was his daughter.”
“Miss Havisham was an only child?” I hazarded.
“Stop a moment, I am coming to that. No, she was not an only
164 Great Expectations
child; she had a half-brother. Her father privately married again––
his cook, I rather think.”
“I thought he was proud,” said I.
“My good Handel, so he was. He married his second wife privately, because he was proud, and in course of time she died. When
she was dead, I apprehend he first told his daughter what he had
done, and then the son became a part of the family, residing in the
house you are acquainted with. As the son grew a young man, he
turned out riotous, extravagant, undutiful––altogether bad. At last
his father disinherited him; but he softened when he was dying, and
left him well off, though not nearly so well off as Miss Havisham.
Take another glass of wine, and excuse my mentioning that society as
a body does not expect one to be so strictly conscientious in emptying one’s glass, as to turn it bottom upwards with the rim on one’s
nose.”
I had been doing this, in an excess of attention to his recital. I
thanked him, and apologised. He said, “Not at all,” and resumed.
“Miss Havisham was now an heiress, and you may suppose was
looked after as a great match. Her half-brother had now ample
means again, but what with debts and what with new madness
wasted them most fearfully again. There were stronger differences
between him and her, than there had been between him and his
father, and it is suspected that he cherished a deep and mortal
grudge against her, as having influenced the father’s anger. Now,
I come to the cruel part of the story––merely breaking off, my
dear Handel, to remark that a dinner-napkin will not go into a
tumbler.”
Why I was trying to pack mine into my tumbler, I am wholly
unable to say. I only know that I found myself, with a perseverance
worthy of a much better cause, making the most strenuous exertions
to compress it within those limits. Again I thanked him and apologised, and again he said in the cheerfullest manner, “Not at all, I am
sure!” and resumed.
“There appeared upon the scene––say at the races, or the public
balls, or anywhere else you like––a certain man, who made love to
Miss Havisham. I never saw him, for this happened five-and-twenty
years ago (before you and I were, Handel), but I have heard my
father mention that he was a showy-man, and the kind of man for the
purpose. But that he was not to be, without ignorance or prejudice,
xxii] Volume II Chapter III 165
mistaken for a gentleman, my father most strongly asseverates;
because it is a principle of his that no man who was not a true
gentleman at heart, ever was, since the world began, a true gentleman in manner. He says, no varnish can hide the grain of the wood;
and that the more varnish you put on, the more the grain will
express itself. Well! This man pursued Miss Havisham closely, and
professed to be devoted to her. I believe she had not shown much
susceptibility up to that time; but all she possessed, certainly came
out then, and she passionately loved him. There is no doubt that she
perfectly idolised him. He practised on her affection in that systematic way, that he got great sums of money from her, and he induced
her to buy her brother out of a share in the brewery (which had been
weakly left him by his father) at an immense price, on the plea that
when he was her husband he must hold and manage it all.* Your
guardian was not at that time in Miss Havisham’s councils, and she
was too haughty and too much in love to be advised by any one. Her
relations were poor and scheming, with the exception of my father;
he was poor enough, but not time-serving or jealous. The only
independent one among them, he warned her that she was doing too
much for this man, and was placing herself too unreservedly in his
power. She took the first opportunity of angrily ordering my father
out of her house, in his presence, and my father has never seen her
since.”
I thought of her having said, “Matthew will come and see me at
last when I am laid dead upon that table;” and I asked Herbert
whether his father was so inveterate against her?
“It’s not that,” said he, “but she charged him, in the presence of
her intended husband, with being disappointed in the hope of fawning upon her for his own advancement, and, if he were to go to her
now, it would look true––even to him––and even to her. To return to
the man and make an end of him. The marriage day was fixed, the
wedding dresses were bought, the wedding tour was planned out, the
wedding guests were invited. The day came, but not the bridegroom.
He wrote her a letter––––”
“Which she received,” I struck in, “when she was dressing for her
marriage? At twenty minutes to nine?”
“At the hour and minute,” said Herbert, nodding, “at which she
afterwards stopped all the clocks. What was in it, further than that it
most heartlessly broke the marriage off, I can’t tell you, because I
166 Great Expectations
don’t know. When she recovered from a bad illness that she had, she
laid the whole place waste, as you have seen it, and she has never
since looked upon the light of day.”
“Is that all the story?” I asked, after considering it.
“All I know of it; and indeed I only know so much, through
piecing it out for myself; for my father always avoids it, and, even
when Miss Havisham invited me to go there, told me no more of it
than it was absolutely requisite I should understand. But I have
forgotten one thing. It has been supposed that the man to whom she
gave her misplaced confidence, acted throughout in concert with her
half-brother; that it was a conspiracy between them; and that they
shared the profits.”
“I wonder he didn’t marry her and get all the property,” said I.
“He may have been married already, and her cruel mortification
may have been a part of her half-brother’s scheme,” said Herbert.
“Mind! I don’t know that.”
“What became of the two men?” I asked, after again considering
the subject.
“They fell into deeper shame and degradation––if there can be
deeper––and ruin.”
“Are they alive now?”
“I don’t know.”
“You said just now, that Estella was not related to Miss Havisham,
but adopted. When adopted?”
Herbert shrugged his shoulders. “There has always been an
Estella, since I have heard of a Miss Havisham. I know no more. And
now Handel,” said he, finally throwing off the story as it were, “there
is a perfectly open understanding between us. All that I know about
Miss Havisham, you know.”
“And all that I know,” I retorted, “you know.”
“I fully believe it. So there can be no competition or perplexity
between you and me. And as to the condition on which you hold
your advancement in life––namely, that you are not to inquire or
discuss to whom you owe it––you may be very sure that it will never
be encroached upon, or even approached, by me, or by any one
belonging to me.”
In truth, he said this with so much delicacy, that I felt the subject
done with, even though I should be under his father’s roof for years
and years to come. Yet he said it with so much meaning, too, that I
xxii] Volume II Chapter III 167
felt he as perfectly understood Miss Havisham to be my benefactress, as I understood the fact myself.
It had not occurred to me before, that he had led up to the theme
for the purpose of clearing it out of our way; but we were so much
the lighter and easier for having broached it, that I now perceived
this to be the case. We were very gay and sociable, and I asked him, in
the course of conversation, what he was? He replied, “A capitalist*
––an Insurer of Ships.” I suppose he saw me glancing about the
room in search of some tokens of Shipping, or capital, for he added,
“In the City.”
I had grand ideas of the wealth and importance of Insurers of
Ships in the City, and I began to think with awe, of having laid a
young Insurer on his back, blackened his enterprising eye, and cut
his responsible head open. But, again, there came upon me, for my
relief, that odd impression that Herbert Pocket would never be very
successful or rich.
“I shall not rest satisfied with merely employing my capital in
insuring ships. I shall buy up some good Life Assurance shares, and
cut into the Direction.* I shall also do a little in the mining way.
None of these things will interfere with my chartering a few thousand tons on my own account. I think I shall trade,” said he, leaning
back in his chair, “to the East Indies, for silks, shawls, spices, dyes,
drugs, and precious woods. It’s an interesting trade.”
“And the profits are large?” said I.
“Tremendous!” said he.
I wavered again, and began to think here were greater expectations than my own.
“I think I shall trade, also,” said he, putting his thumbs in his
waistcoat pockets, “to the West Indies, for sugar, tobacco, and rum.
Also to Ceylon, specially for elephants’ tusks.”
“You will want a good many ships,” said I.
“A perfect fleet,” said he.
Quite overpowered by the magnificence of these transactions, I
asked him where the ships he insured mostly traded to at present?
“I haven’t begun insuring yet,” he replied. “I am looking about me.”
Somehow, that pursuit seemed more in keeping with Barnard’s
Inn. I said (in a tone of conviction), “Ah-h!”
“Yes. I am in a counting-house, and looking about me.”
“Is a counting-house profitable?” I asked.
168 Great Expectations
“To––––do you mean to the young fellow who’s in it?” he asked,
in reply.
“Yes; to you.”
“Why, n-no: not to me.” He said this with the air of one carefully
reckoning up and striking a balance. “Not directly profitable. That
is, it doesn’t pay me anything, and I have to––––keep myself.”
This certainly had not a profitable appearance, and I shook my
head as if I would imply that it would be difficult to lay by much
accumulative capital from such a source of income.
“But the thing is,” said Herbert Pocket, “that you look about you.
That’s the grand thing. You are in a counting-house, you know, and
you look about you.”
It struck me as a singular implication that you couldn’t be out of a
counting-house, you know, and look about you; but I silently
deferred to his experience.
“Then the time comes,” said Herbert, “when you see your opening. And you go in, and you swoop upon it and you make your
capital, and then there you are! When you have once made your
capital, you have nothing to do but employ it.”
This was very like his way of conducting that encounter in the
garden; very like. His manner of bearing his poverty, too, exactly
corresponded to his manner of bearing that defeat. It seemed to me
that he took all blows and buffets now, with just the same air as he
had taken mine then. It was evident that he had nothing around him
but the simplest necessaries, for everything that I remarked upon
turned out to have been sent in on my account from the coffee-house
or somewhere else.
Yet, having already made his fortune in his own mind, he was so unassuming with it that I felt quite grateful to him for not being puffed
up. It was a pleasant addition to his naturally pleasant ways, and we
got on famously. In the evening we went out for a walk in the streets,
and went half-price to the Theatre;* and next day we went to church
at Westminster Abbey, and in the afternoon we walked in the Parks;
and I wondered who shod all the horses there, and wished Joe did.
On a moderate computation, it was many months, that Sunday,
since I had left Joe and Biddy. The space interposed between myself
and them, partook of that expansion, and our marshes were any
distance off. That I could have been at our old church in my old
church-going clothes, on the very last Sunday that ever was, seemed
xxii] Volume II Chapter III 169
a combination of impossibilities, geographical and social, solar and
lunar. Yet in the London streets, so crowded with people and so
brilliantly lighted* in the dusk of evening, there were depressing
hints of reproaches for that I had put the poor old kitchen at home so
far away; and in the dead of night, the footsteps of some incapable
impostor of a porter mooning about Barnard’s Inn, under pretence
of watching it, fell hollow on my heart.
On the Monday morning at a quarter before nine, Herbert went to
the counting-house to report himself––to look about him, too, I
suppose––and I bore him company. He was to come away in an hour
or two to attend me to Hammersmith, and I was to wait about for
him. It appeared to me that the eggs from which young Insurers
were hatched, were incubated in dust and heat, like the eggs of
ostriches, judging from the places to which those incipient giants
repaired on a Monday morning. Nor did the counting-house where
Herbert assisted, show in my eyes as at all a good Observatory; being
a back second floor up a yard, of a grimy presence in all particulars,
and with a look into another back second floor, rather than a look out.
I waited about until it was noon, and I went upon ’Change,* and I
saw fluey* men sitting there under the bills about shipping, whom I
took to be great merchants, though I couldn’t understand why they
should all be out of spirits. When Herbert came, we went and had
lunch at a celebrated house which I then quite venerated, but now
believe to have been the most abject superstition in Europe, and
where I could not help noticing, even then, that there was much
more gravy on the tablecloths and knives and waiters’ clothes, than
in the steaks. This collation disposed of at a moderate price (considering the grease: which was not charged for), we went back to
Barnard’s Inn and got my little portmanteau, and then took coach for
Hammersmith. We arrived there at two or three o’clock in the afternoon, and had very little way to walk to Mr. Pocket’s house. Lifting
the latch of a gate, we passed direct into a little garden overlooking
the river, where Mr. Pocket’s children were playing about. And
unless I deceive myself on a point where my interests or prepossessions are certainly not concerned, I saw that Mr. and Mrs. Pocket’s
children were not growing up or being brought up, but were tumbling up.
Mrs. Pocket was sitting on a garden chair under a tree, reading,
with her legs upon another garden chair; and Mrs. Pocket’s two
170 Great Expectations
nursemaids, were looking about them while the children played.
“Mamma,” said Herbert, “this is young Mr. Pip.” Upon which Mrs.
Pocket received me with an appearance of amiable dignity.
“Master Alick and Miss Jane,” cried one of the nurses to two of
the children, “if you go a bouncing up against them bushes you’ll fall
over into the river and be drownded, and what’ll your pa say then!”
At the same time this nurse picked up Mrs. Pocket’s handkerchief,
and said, “If that don’t make six times you’ve dropped it, Mum!”
Upon which Mrs. Pocket laughed and said, “Thank you, Flopson,”
and settling herself in one chair only, resumed her book. Her countenance immediately assumed a knitted and intent expression as if
she had been reading for a week, but before she could have read half
a dozen lines, she fixed her eyes upon me, and said, “I hope your
mamma is quite well?” This unexpected inquiry put me into such a
difficulty that I began saying in the absurdest way that if there had
been any such person I had no doubt she would have been quite well
and would have been very much obliged and would have sent her
compliments, when the nurse came to my rescue.
“Well!” she cried, picking up the pocket-handkerchief, “if that
don’t make seven times! What are you a doing of this afternoon,
Mum!” Mrs. Pocket received her property, at first with a look of
unutterable surprise as if she had never seen it before, and then with
a laugh of recognition, and said, “Thank you, Flopson,” and forgot
me, and went on reading.
I found, now I had leisure to count them, that there were no fewer
than six little Pockets present, in various stages of tumbling up. I had
scarcely arrived at the total when a seventh was heard, as in the
region of air, wailing dolefully.
“If there ain’t Baby!” said Flopson, appearing to think it most
surprising. “Make haste up, Millers.”
Millers, who was the other nurse, retired into the house, and by
degrees the child’s wailing was hushed and stopped, as if it were a
young ventriloquist with something in its mouth. Mrs Pocket read
all the time, and I was curious to know what the book could be.
We were waiting, I supposed, for Mr. Pocket to come out to us; at
any rate we waited there, and so I had an opportunity of observing
the remarkable family phenomenon that whenever any of the children strayed near Mrs. Pocket in their play, they always tripped
themselves up and tumbled over her––always very much to her
xxii] Volume II Chapter III 171
momentary astonishment, and their own more enduring lamentation. I was at a loss to account for this surprising circumstance, and
could not help giving my mind to speculations about it, until byand-by Millers came down with the baby, which baby was handed to
Flopson, which Flopson was handing to Mrs. Pocket, when she too
went fairly head-foremost over Mrs Pocket, baby and all, and was
caught by Herbert and myself.
“Gracious me, Flopson!” said Mrs. Pocket, looking off her book
for a moment, “everybody’s tumbling!”
“Gracious you, indeed, Mum!” returned Flopson, very red in the
face; “what have you got there?”
“I got here, Flopson?” asked Mrs. Pocket.
“Why, if it ain’t your footstool!” cried Flopson. “And if you keep
it under your skirts like that, who’s to help tumbling! Here! Take the
baby, Mum, and give me your book.”
Mrs. Pocket acted on the advice, and inexpertly danced the infant
a little in her lap, while the other children played about it. This had
lasted but a very short time, when Mrs. Pocket issued summary
orders that they were all to be taken into the house for a nap. Thus I
made the second discovery on that first occasion, that the nurture of
the little Pockets consisted of alternately tumbling up and lying
down.
Under these circumstances, when Flopson and Millers had got
the children into the house, like a little flock of sheep, and Mr.
Pocket came out of it to make my acquaintance, I was not much
surprised to find that Mr. Pocket was a gentleman with a rather
perplexed expression of face, and with his very grey hair disordered
on his head, as if he didn’t quite see his way to putting anything
straight.
CHAPTER IV
Mr. Pocket said he was glad to see me, and he hoped I was not
sorry to see him. “For, I really am not,” he added, with his son’s
smile, “an alarming personage.” He was a young-looking-man, in
spite of his perplexities and his very grey hair, and his manner
seemed quite natural. I use the word natural, in the sense of its being
unaffected; there was something comic in his distraught way, as
172 Great Expectations
though it would have been downright ludicrous but for his own
perception that it was very near being so. When he had talked with
me a little, he said to Mrs. Pocket, with a rather anxious contraction
of his eyebrows, which were black and handsome, “Belinda, I hope
you have welcomed Mr. Pip?” And she looked up from her book, and
said, “Yes.” She then smiled upon me in an absent state of mind, and
asked me if I liked the taste of orange-flower water? As the question
had no bearing, near or remote, on any foregone or subsequent
transaction, I consider it to have been thrown out, like her previous
approaches, in general conversational condescension.
I found out within a few hours, and may mention at once, that
Mrs. Pocket was the only daughter of a certain quite accidental
deceased Knight, who had invented for himself a conviction that his
deceased father would have been made a Baronet but for somebody’s
determined opposition arising out of entirely personal motives––I
forget whose, if I ever knew––the Sovereign’s, the Prime Minister’s,
the Lord Chancellor’s, the Archbishop of Canterbury’s, anybody’s––
and had tacked himself on to the nobles of the earth in right of this
quite supposititious fact. I believe he had been knighted himself for
storming the English grammar at the point of the pen, in a desperate
address engrossed on vellum, on the occasion of the laying of the
first stone of some building or other, and for handing some Royal
Personage either the trowel or the mortar. Be that as it may, he had
directed Mrs. Pocket to be brought up from her cradle as one who in
the nature of things must marry a title, and who was to be guarded
from the acquisition of plebeian domestic knowledge. So successful a
watch and ward* had been established over the young lady by this
judicious parent, that she had grown up highly ornamental, but
perfectly helpless and useless. With her character thus happily
formed, in the first bloom of her youth she had encountered Mr.
Pocket: who was also in the first bloom of youth, and not quite
decided whether to mount to the Woolsack, or to roof himself in
with a mitre.* As his doing the one or the other was a mere question
of time, he and Mrs. Pocket had taken Time by the forelock* (when,
to judge from its length, it would seem to have wanted cutting), and
had married without the knowledge of the judicious parent. The
judicious parent, having nothing to bestow or withhold but his blessing, had handsomely settled that dower upon them after a short
struggle, and had informed Mr. Pocket that his wife was “a treasure
xxiii] Volume II Chapter IV 173
for a Prince.” Mr. Pocket had invested the Prince’s treasure in the
ways of the world ever since, and it was supposed to have brought
him in but indifferent interest. Still, Mrs. Pocket was in general the
object of a queer sort of respectful pity, because she had not married
a title; while Mr. Pocket was the object of a queer sort of forgiving
reproach, because he had never got one.
Mr. Pocket took me into the house and showed me my room:
which was a pleasant one, and so furnished as that I could use it with
comfort for my own private sitting-room. He then knocked at the
doors of two other similar rooms, and introduced me to their occupants, by name Drummle and Startop. Drummle, an old-looking
young man of a heavy order of architecture, was whistling. Startop,
younger in years and appearance, was reading and holding his head,
as if he thought himself in danger of exploding it with too strong a
charge of knowledge.
Both Mr. and Mrs. Pocket had such a noticeable air of being in
somebody else’s hands, that I wondered who really was in possession
of the house and let them live there, until I found this unknown
power to be the servants. It was a smooth way of going on, perhaps,
in respect of saving trouble; but it had the appearance of being
expensive, for the servants felt it a duty they owed to themselves to
be nice in their eating and drinking, and to keep a deal of company
down stairs. They allowed a very liberal table to Mr. and Mrs.
Pocket, yet it always appeared to me that by far the best part of the
house to have boarded in, would have been the kitchen––always
supposing the boarder capable of self-defence, for, before I had been
there a week, a neighbouring lady with whom the family was personally unacquainted, wrote in to say that she had seen Millers slapping
the baby. This greatly distressed Mrs. Pocket, who burst into tears
on receiving the note, and said it was an extraordinary thing that the
neighbours couldn’t mind their own business.
By degrees I learnt, and chiefly from Herbert, that Mr. Pocket had
been educated at Harrow and at Cambridge, where he had distinguished himself; but that when he had had the happiness of
marrying Mrs. Pocket very early in life, he had impaired his prospects and taken up the calling of a Grinder.* After grinding a number of dull blades––of whom it was remarkable that their fathers,
when influential, were always going to help him to preferment, but
always forgot to do it when the blades had left the Grindstone––he
174 Great Expectations
had wearied of that poor work and had come to London. Here, after
gradually failing in loftier hopes, he had “read” with divers who had
lacked opportunities or neglected them, and had refurbished divers
others for special occasions, and had turned his acquirements to the
account of literary compilation and correction, and on such means,
added to some very moderate private resources, still maintained the
house I saw.
Mr. and Mrs. Pocket had a toady neighbour; a widow lady of that
highly sympathetic nature that she agreed with everybody, blessed
everybody, and shed smiles and tears on everybody, according to
circumstances. This lady’s name was Mrs. Coiler, and I had the
honour of taking her down to dinner on the day of my installation.
She gave me to understand on the stairs, that it was a blow to dear
Mrs. Pocket that dear Mr. Pocket should be under the necessity of
receiving gentlemen to read with him. That did not extend to Me,
she told me in a gush of love and confidence (at that time, I had
known her something less than five minutes); if they were all like
Me, it would be quite another thing.
“But dear Mrs. Pocket,” said Mrs. Coiler, “after her early disappointment (not that dear Mr. Pocket was to blame in that), requires
so much luxury and elegance––––”
“Yes, ma’am,” I said, to stop her, for I was afraid she was going to
cry.
“And she is of so aristocratic a disposition––––”
“Yes, ma’am,” I said again, with the same object as before.
“––that it is hard,” said Mrs. Coiler, “to have dear Mr. Pocket’s
time and attention diverted from dear Mrs. Pocket.”
I could not help thinking that it might be harder if the butcher’s
time and attention were diverted from dear Mrs. Pocket; but I said
nothing, and indeed had enough to do in keeping a bashful watch
upon my company-manners.
It came to my knowledge, through what passed between Mrs.
Pocket and Drummle while I was attentive to my knife and fork,
spoon, glasses, and other instruments of self-destruction, that
Drummle, whose christian name was Bentley, was actually the next
heir but one to a baronetcy. It further appeared that the book I had
seen Mrs. Pocket reading in the garden, was all about titles,* and
that she knew the exact date at which her grandpapa would have
come into the book, if he ever had come at all. Drummle didn’t say
xxiii] Volume II Chapter IV 175
much, but in his limited way (he struck me as a sulky kind of fellow)
he spoke as one of the elect, and recognised Mrs. Pocket as a woman
and a sister.* No one but themselves and Mrs. Coiler the toady
neighbour showed any interest in this part of the conversation, and it
appeared to me that it was painful to Herbert; but it promised to last
a long time, when the page came in with the announcement of a
domestic affliction. It was, in effect, that the cook had mislaid the
beef. To my unutterable amazement, I now, for the first time, saw
Mr. Pocket relieve his mind by going through a performance that
struck me as very extraordinary, but which made no impression on
anybody else, and with which I soon became as familiar as the rest.
He laid down the carving-knife and fork––being engaged in carving,
at the moment––put his two hands into his disturbed hair, and
appeared to make an extraordinary effort to lift himself up by it.
When he had done this, and had not lifted himself up at all, he
quietly went on with what he was about.
Mrs. Coiler then changed the subject, and began to flatter me. I
liked it for a few moments but she flattered me so very grossly that
the pleasure was soon over. She had a serpentine way of coming close
at me when she pretended to be vitally interested in the friends and
localities I had left, which was altogether snaky and fork-tongued;
and when she made an occasional bounce upon Startop (who said
very little to her), or upon Drummle (who said less), I rather envied
them for being on the opposite side of the table.
After dinner the children were introduced, and Mrs. Coiler made
admiring comments on their eyes, noses, and legs––a sagacious way
of improving their minds. There were four little girls, and two little
boys, besides the baby who might have been either, and the baby’s
next successor who was as yet neither. They were brought in by
Flopson and Millers, much as though those two non-commissioned
officers had been recruiting somewhere for children and had enlisted
these: while Mrs. Pocket looked at the young Nobles that ought to
have been, as if she rather thought she had had the pleasure of
inspecting them before, but didn’t quite know what to make of them.
“Here! Give me your fork, Mum, and take the baby,” said Flopson. “Don’t take it that way, or you’ll get its head under the table.”
Thus advised, Mrs. Pocket took it the other way, and got its head
upon the table; which was announced to all present by a prodigious
concussion.
176 Great Expectations
“Dear, dear! Give it me back, Mum,” said Flopson; “and Miss
Jane, come and dance to baby, do!”
One of the little girls, a mere mite who seemed to have prematurely taken upon herself some charge of the others, stepped out
of her place by me, and danced to and from the baby until it left off
crying, and laughed. Then, all the children laughed, and Mr. Pocket
(who in the meantime had twice endeavoured to lift himself up by
the hair) laughed, and we all laughed and were glad.
Flopson, by dint of doubling the baby at the joints like a Dutch
doll,* then got it safely into Mrs. Pocket’s lap, and gave it the
nutcrackers to play with: at the same time recommending Mrs.
Pocket to take notice that the handles of that instrument were not
likely to agree with its eyes, and sharply charging Miss Jane to look
after the same. Then, the two nurses left the room, and had a lively
scuffle on the staircase with a dissipated page who had waited at
dinner, and who had clearly lost half his buttons at the gamingtable.*
I was made very uneasy in my mind by Mrs. Pocket’s falling into a
discussion with Drummle respecting two baronetcies, while she ate a
sliced orange steeped in sugar and wine, and forgetting all about the
baby on her lap: who did most appalling things with the nutcrackers.
At length, little Jane perceiving its young brains to be imperiled,
softly left her place, and with many small artifices coaxed the dangerous weapon away. Mrs. Pocket finishing her orange at about the
same time, and not approving of this, said to Jane:
“You naughty child, how dare you? Go and sit down this instant!”
“Mamma dear,” lisped the little girl, “baby ood have put hith
eyeth out.”
“How dare you tell me so?” retorted Mrs. Pocket. “Go and sit
down in your chair this moment!”
Mrs. Pocket’s dignity was so crushing, that I felt quite abashed: as
if I myself had done something to rouse it.
“Belinda,” remonstrated Mr. Pocket, from the other end of the
table, “how can you be so unreasonable? Jane only interfered for the
protection of baby.”
“I will not allow anybody to interfere,” said Mrs. Pocket. “I am
surprised, Matthew, that you should expose me to the affront of
interference.”
“Good God!” cried Mr. Pocket, in an outbreak of desolate
xxiii] Volume II Chapter IV 177
desperation. “Are infants to be nutcrackered into their tombs, and is
nobody to save them?”
“I will not be interfered with by Jane,” said Mrs. Pocket, with a
majestic glance at that innocent little offender. “I hope I know my
poor grandpapa’s position. Jane, indeed!”
Mr. Pocket got his hands in his hair again, and this time really did
lift himself some inches out of his chair. “Hear this!” he helplessly
exclaimed to the elements. “Babies are to be nutcrackered dead, for
people’s poor grandpapa’s positions!” Then he let himself down
again, and became silent.
We all looked awkwardly at the tablecloth while this was going on.
A pause succeeded, during which the honest and irrepressible baby
made a series of leaps and crows at little Jane, who appeared to me to
be the only member of the family (irrespective of servants) with
whom it had any decided acquaintance.
“Mr. Drummle,” said Mrs. Pocket, “will you ring for Flopson?
Jane, you undutiful little thing, go and lie down. Now, baby darling,
come with ma!”
The baby was the soul of honour, and protested with all its might.
It doubled itself up the wrong way over Mrs. Pocket’s arm, exhibited
a pair of knitted shoes and dimpled ankles to the company in lieu of
its soft face, and was carried out in the highest state of mutiny. And it
gained its point after all, for I saw it through the window within a few
minutes, being nursed by little Jane.
It happened that the other five children were left behind at the
dinner-table, through Flopson’s having some private engagement,
and their not being anybody else’s business. I thus became aware of
the mutual relations between them and Mr. Pocket, which were
exemplified in the following manner. Mr. Pocket, with the normal
perplexity of his face heightened and his hair rumpled, looked at
them for some minutes, as if he couldn’t make out how they came to
be boarding and lodging in that establishment, and why they hadn’t
been billeted by Nature on somebody else. Then, in a distant, Missionary way he asked them certain questions––as why little Joe had
that hole in his frill: who said, Pa, Flopson was going to mend it
when she had time––and how little Fanny came by that whitlow:*
who said, Pa, Millers was going to poultice it when she didn’t forget.
Then, he melted into parental tenderness, and gave them a shilling
apiece and told them to go and play; and then as they went out, with
178 Great Expectations
one very strong effort to lift himself up by the hair he dismissed the
hopeless subject.
In the evening there was rowing on the river. As Drummle and
Startop had each a boat, I resolved to set up mine, and to cut them
both out. I was pretty good at most exercises in which country-boys
are adepts, but, as I was conscious of wanting elegance of style for
the Thames––not to say for other waters––I at once engaged to place
myself under the tuition of the winner of a prize-wherry* who plied
at our stairs, and to whom I was introduced by my new allies. This
practical authority confused me very much, by saying I had the arm
of a blacksmith. If he could have known how nearly the compliment
lost him his pupil, I doubt if he would have paid it.
There was a supper-tray after we got home at night, and I think
we should all have enjoyed ourselves, but for a rather disagreeable
domestic occurrence. Mr. Pocket was in good spirits, when a housemaid came in, and said, “If you please, sir, I should wish to speak to
you.”
“Speak to your master?” said Mrs. Pocket, whose dignity was
roused again. “How can you think of such a thing? Go and speak to
Flopson. Or speak to me––at some other time.”
“Begging your pardon, ma’am?” returned the housemaid, “I
should wish to speak at once and to speak to master.”
Hereupon, Mr. Pocket went out of the room, and we made the
best of ourselves until he came back.
“This is a pretty thing, Belinda!” said Mr. Pocket, returning with
a countenance expressive of grief and despair. “Here’s the cook lying
insensibly drunk on the kitchen floor, with a large bundle of fresh
butter made up in the cupboard ready to sell for grease!”
Mrs. Pocket instantly showed much amiable emotion, and said,
“This is that odious Sophia’s doing!”
“What do you mean, Belinda?” demanded Mr. Pocket.
“Sophia has told you,” said Mrs. Pocket. “Did I not see her with
my own eyes and hear her with my own ears, come into the room just
now and ask to speak to you?”
“But has she not taken me down stairs, Belinda,” returned Mr.
Pocket, “and shown me the woman, and the bundle too?”
“And do you defend her, Matthew,” said Mrs. Pocket, “for making mischief?”
Mr. Pocket uttered a dismal groan.
xxiii] Volume II Chapter IV 179
“Am I, grandpapa’s granddaughter, to be nothing in the house?”
said Mrs. Pocket. “Besides, the cook has always been a very nice respectful woman, and said in the most natural manner when she came
to look after the situation, that she felt I was born to be a Duchess.”
There was a sofa where Mr. Pocket stood, and he dropped upon
it in the attitude of the Dying Gladiator.* Still in that attitude he
said, with a hollow voice, “Good night, Mr. Pip,” when I deemed it
advisable to go to bed and leave him.
CHAPTER V
After two or three days, when I had established myself in my
room and had gone backwards and forwards to London several
times, and had ordered all I wanted of my tradesmen, Mr. Pocket
and I had a long talk together. He knew more of my intended career
than I knew myself, for he referred to his having been told by Mr.
Jaggers that I was not designed for any profession, and that I should
be well enough educated for my destiny if I could “hold my own”
with the average of young men in prosperous circumstances. I acquiesced, of course, knowing nothing to the contrary.
He advised my attending certain places in London, for the acquisition of such mere rudiments as I wanted, and my investing him
with the functions of explainer and director of all my studies. He
hoped that with intelligent assistance I should meet with little to
discourage me, and should soon be able to dispense with any aid but
his. Through his way of saying this, and much more to similar purpose, he placed himself on confidential terms with me in an admirable manner; and I may state at once that he was always so zealous
and honourable in fulfilling his compact with me, that he made me
zealous and honourable in fulfilling mine with him. If he had shown
indifference as a master, I have no doubt I should have returned the
compliment as a pupil; he gave me no such excuse, and each of us
did the other justice. Nor, did I ever regard him as having anything
ludicrous about him––or anything but what was serious, honest, and
good––in his tutor communication with me.
When these points were settled, and so far carried out as that I had
begun to work in earnest, it occurred to me that if I could retain my
bedroom in Barnard’s Inn, my life would be agreeably varied, while
180 Great Expectations
my manners would be none the worse for Herbert’s society. Mr.
Pocket did not object to this arrangement, but urged that before any
step could possibly be taken in it, it must be submitted to my guardian. I felt that his delicacy arose out of the consideration that the
plan would save Herbert some expense, so I went off to Little Britain
and imparted my wish to Mr. Jaggers.
“If I could buy the furniture now hired for me,” said I, “and one
or two other little things, I should be quite at home there.”
“Go it!” said Mr. Jaggers, with a short laugh. “I told you you’d get
on. Well! How much do you want?”
I said I didn’t know how much.
“Come!” retorted Mr. Jaggers. “How much? Fifty pounds?”
“Oh, not nearly so much.”
“Five pounds?” said Mr. Jaggers.
This was such a great fall, that I said in discomfiture, “Oh! more
than that.”
“More than that, eh?” retorted Mr. Jaggers, lying in wait for me,
with his hands in his pockets, his head on one side, and his eyes on
the wall behind me; “how much more?”
“It is so difficult to fix a sum,” said I, hesitating.
“Come!” said Mr. Jaggers. “Let’s get at it. Twice five; will that do?
Three times five; will that do? Four times five; will that do?”
I said I thought that would do handsomely.
“Four times five will do handsomely, will it?” said Mr. Jaggers,
knitting his brows. “Now, what do you make of four times five?”
“What do I make of it?”
“Ah!” said Mr. Jaggers; “how much?”
“I suppose you make it twenty pounds,” said I, smiling.
“Never mind what I make it, my friend,” observed Mr. Jaggers,
with a knowing and contradictory toss of his head. “I want to know
what you make it.”
“Twenty pounds, of course.”
“Wemmick!” said Mr. Jaggers, opening his office door. “Take Mr.
Pip’s written order, and pay him twenty pounds.”
This strongly marked way of doing business made a strongly
marked impression on me, and that not of an agreeable kind. Mr.
Jaggers never laughed; but he wore great bright creaking boots, and,
in poising himself on these boots, with his large head bent down and
his eyebrows joined together, awaiting an answer, he sometimes
xxiv] Volume II Chapter V 181
caused the boots to creak, as if they laughed in a dry and suspicious
way.* As he happened to go out now, and as Wemmick was brisk and
talkative, I said to Wemmick that I hardly knew what to make of Mr.
Jaggers’s manner.
“Tell him that, and he’ll take it as a compliment,” answered
Wemmick; “he don’t mean that you should know what to make of
it.––Oh!” for I looked surprised, “it’s not personal; it’s professional:
only professional.”
Wemmick was at his desk, lunching––and crunching––on a dry
hard biscuit; pieces of which he threw from time to time into his slit
of a mouth, as if he were posting them.
“Always seems to me,” said Wemmick, “as if he had set a mantrap and was watching it. Suddenly––click––you’re caught!”
Without remarking that man-traps were not among the amenities
of life, I said I supposed he was very skilful?
“Deep,” said Wemmick, “as Australia.” Pointing with his pen at
the office floor, to express that Australia was understood, for the
purposes of the figure, to be symmetrically on the opposite spot of
the globe. “If there was anything deeper,” added Wemmick, bringing
his pen to paper, “he’d be it.”
Then, I said I supposed he had a fine business, and Wemmick
said, “Ca-pi-tal!” then I asked if there were many clerks? to which he
replied:
“We don’t run much into clerks, because there’s only one Jaggers,
and people won’t have him at second hand. There are only four
of us. Would you like to see ’em? You are one of us, as I may
say.”
I accepted the offer. When Mr. Wemmick had put all the biscuit in
the post, and had paid me my money from a cash-box in a safe, the
key of which safe he kept somewhere down his back and produced
from his coat-collar like an iron pigtail, we went up-stairs. The house
was dark and shabby, and the greasy shoulders that had left their
mark in Mr. Jaggers’s room, seemed to have been shuffling up and
down the staircase for years. In the front first floor, a clerk who
looked something between a publican and a rat-catcher––a large pale
puffed swollen man––was attentively engaged with three or four
people of shabby appearance, whom he treated as unceremoniously
as everybody seemed to be treated who contributed to Mr. Jaggers’s
coffers. “Getting evidence together,” said Mr. Wemmick, as we came
182 Great Expectations
out, “for the Bailey.” In the room over that, a little flabby terrier of a
clerk with dangling hair (his cropping seemed to have been forgotten
when he was a puppy) was similarly engaged with a man with weak
eyes, whom Mr. Wemmick presented to me as a smelter who kept his
pot always boiling, and who would melt me anything* I pleased––
and who was in an excessive white-perspiration, as if he had been
trying his art on himself. In a back room, a high-shouldered man
with a face-ache tied up in dirty flannel, who was dressed in old black
clothes that bore the appearance of having been waxed, was stooping
over his work of making fair copies of the notes of the other two
gentlemen, for Mr. Jaggers’s own use.
This was all the establishment. When we went down stairs again,
Wemmick led me into my guardian’s room, and said, “This you’ve
seen already.”
“Pray,” said I, as the two odious casts with the twitchy leer upon
them caught my sight again, “whose likenesses are those?”
“These?” said Wemmick, getting upon a chair, and blowing the
dust off the horrible heads before bringing them down. “These are
two celebrated ones. Famous clients of ours that got us a world of
credit. This chap (why you must have come down in the night and
been peeping into the inkstand, to get this blot upon your eyebrow,
you old rascal!) murdered his master, and, considering that he wasn’t
brought up to evidence, didn’t plan it badly.”
“Is it like him?” I asked, recoiling from the brute, as Wemmick
spat upon his eyebrow and gave it a rub with his sleeve.
“Like him? It’s himself, you know. The cast was made in Newgate,
directly after he was taken down. You had a particular fancy for me,
hadn’t you, Old Artful?” said Wemmick. He then explained this
affectionate apostrophe, by touching his brooch representing the
lady and the weeping willow at the tomb with an urn upon it, and
saying, “Had it made for me, express!”
“Is the lady anybody?” said I.
“No,” returned Wemmick. “Only his game.* (You liked your bit of
game, didn’t you?) No; deuce a bit of a lady in the case, Mr. Pip,
except one––and she wasn’t of this slender ladylike sort, and you
wouldn’t have caught her looking after this urn––unless there was
something to drink in it.” Wemmick’s attention being thus directed
to his brooch, he put down the cast, and polished the brooch with his
pocket-handkerchief.
xxiv] Volume II Chapter V 183
“Did that other creature come to the same end?” I asked. “He has
the same look.”
“You’re right,” said Wemmick; “it’s the genuine look. Much as if
one nostril was caught up with a horsehair and a little fish-hook.* Yes,
he came to the same end; quite the natural end here, I assure you. He
forged wills, this blade did, if he didn’t also put the supposed testators to sleep too. You were a gentlemanly Cove, though” (Mr. Wemmick was again apostrophising), “and you said you could write
Greek. Yah, Bounceable!* What a liar you were. I never met such a
liar as you!” Before putting his late friend on his shelf again, Wemmick touched the largest of his mourning rings, and said, “Sent out
to buy it for me, only the day before.”
While he was putting up the other cast and coming down from the
chair, the thought crossed my mind that all his personal jewellery
was derived from like sources. As he had shown no diffidence on the
subject, I ventured on the liberty of asking him the question, when
he stood before me, dusting his hands.
“Oh yes,” he returned, “these are all gifts of that kind. One brings
another, you see; that’s the way of it. I always take ’em. They’re
curiosities. And they’re property. They may not be worth much, but,
after all, they’re property and portable. It don’t signify to you with
your brilliant look-out, but as to myself, my guiding-star always is,
Get hold of portable property.”
When I had rendered homage to this light, he went on to say, in a
friendly manner:
“If at any odd time when you have nothing better to do, you
wouldn’t mind coming over to see me at Walworth, I could offer you
a bed, and I should consider it an honour. I have not much to show
you; but such two or three curiosities as I have got, you might like to
look over; and I am fond of a bit of garden and a summer-house.”
I said I should be delighted to accept his hospitality.
“Thankee,” said he; “then we’ll consider that it’s to come off,
when convenient to you. Have you dined with Mr. Jaggers yet?”
“Not yet.”
“Well,” said Wemmick, “he’ll give you wine, and good wine. I’ll
give you punch, and not bad punch. And now I’ll tell you something.
When you go to dine with Mr. Jaggers, look at his housekeeper.”
“Shall I see something very uncommon?”
“Well,” said Wemmick, “you’ll see a wild beast tamed. Not so very
184 Great Expectations
uncommon, you’ll tell me. I reply, that depends on the original wildness of the beast, and the amount of taming. It won’t lower your
opinion of Mr. Jaggers’s powers. Keep your eye on it.”
I told him I would do so, with all the interest and curiosity that his
preparation awakened. As I was taking my departure, he asked me if
I would like to devote five minutes to seeing Mr. Jaggers “at it?”
For several reasons, and not least because I didn’t clearly know
what Mr. Jaggers would be found to be “at,” I replied in the affirmative. We dived into the City, and came up in a crowded police-court,
where a blood-relation (in the murderous sense) of the deceased with
the fanciful taste in brooches, was standing at the bar, uncomfortably
chewing something; while my guardian had a woman under examination or cross-examination––I don’t know which––and was striking
her, and the bench, and everybody present, with awe. If anybody, of
whatsoever degree, said a word that he didn’t approve of, he
instantly required to have it “taken down.” If anybody wouldn’t
make an admission, he said, “I’ll have it out of you!” and if anybody
made an admission, he said, “Now I have got you!” The magistrates
shivered under a single bite of his finger. Thieves and thief-takers*
hung in dread rapture on his words, and shrank when a hair of his
eyebrows turned in their direction. Which side he was on, I couldn’t
make out, for he seemed to me to be grinding the whole place in a
mill;* I only know that when I stole out on tiptoe, he was not on the
side of the bench;* for, he was making the legs of the old gentleman
who presided, quite convulsive under the table, by his denunciations
of his conduct as the representative of British law and justice in that
chair that day.
CHAPTER VI
Bentley Drummle, who was so sulky a fellow that he even took
up a book as if its writer had done him an injury, did not take up an
acquaintance in a more agreeable spirit. Heavy in figure, movement,
and comprehension––in the sluggish complexion of his face, and in
the large awkward tongue that seemed to loll about in his mouth as
he himself lolled about in a room––he was idle, proud, niggardly,
reserved, and suspicious. He came of rich people down in Somersetshire, who had nursed this combination of qualities until they made
xxv] Volume II Chapter VI 185
the discovery that it was just of age and a blockhead. Thus, Bentley
Drummle had come to Mr. Pocket when he was a head taller than
that gentleman, and half a dozen heads thicker than most gentlemen.
Startop had been spoilt by a weak mother and kept at home when
he ought to have been at school, but he was devotedly attached to
her, and admired her beyond measure. He had a woman’s delicacy of
feature, and was––“as you may see, though you never saw her,” said
Herbert to me––exactly like his mother. It was but natural that I
should take to him much more kindly than to Drummle, and that,
even in the earliest evenings of our boating, he and I should pull
homeward abreast of one another, conversing from boat to boat,
while Bentley Drummle came up in our wake alone, under the overhanging banks and among the rushes. He would always creep inshore like some uncomfortable amphibious creature, even when the
tide would have sent him fast upon his way; and I always think of him
as coming after us in the dark or by the back-water, when our own
two boats were breaking the sunset or the moonlight in mid-stream.
Herbert was my intimate companion and friend. I presented him
with a half-share in my boat, which was the occasion of his often
coming down to Hammersmith; and my possession of a half-share in
his chambers often took me up to London. We used to walk between
the two places at all hours. I have an affection for the road yet
(though it is not so pleasant a road as it was then), formed in the
impressibility of untried youth and hope.
When I had been in Mr. Pocket’s family a month or two, Mr. and
Mrs. Camilla turned up. Camilla was Mr. Pocket’s sister. Georgiana,
whom I had seen at Miss Havisham’s on the same occasion, also
turned up. She was a cousin––an indigestive single woman, who
called her rigidity religion, and her liver love. These people hated me
with the hatred of cupidity and disappointment. As a matter of
course, they fawned upon me in my prosperity with the basest
meanness. Towards Mr. Pocket, as a grown-up infant with no notion
of his own interests, they showed the complacent forbearance I had
heard them express. Mrs. Pocket they held in contempt; but they
allowed the poor soul to have been heavily disappointed in life,
because that shed a feeble reflected light upon themselves.
These were the surroundings among which I settled down, and
applied myself to my education. I soon contracted expensive habits,
and began to spend an amount of money that within a few short
186 Great Expectations
months I should have thought almost fabulous; but through good
and evil I stuck to my books. There was no other merit in this, than
my having sense enough to feel my deficiences. Between Mr. Pocket
and Herbert I got on fast; and, with one or the other always at my
elbow to give me the start I wanted, and clear obstructions out of my
road, I must have been as great a dolt as Drummle if I had done less.
I had not seen Mr. Wemmick for some weeks, when I thought I
would write him a note and propose to go home with him on a
certain evening. He replied that it would give him much pleasure,
and that he would expect me at the office at six o’clock. Thither I
went, and there I found him, putting the key of the safe down his
back as the clock struck.
“Did you think of walking down to Walworth?” said he.
“Certainly,” said I, “if you approve.”
“Very much,” was Wemmick’s reply, “for I have had my legs
under the desk all day, and shall be glad to stretch them. Now, I’ll tell
you what I have got for supper, Mr. Pip. I have got a stewed steak––
which is of home preparation––and a cold roast fowl––which is from
the cook’s-shop. I think it’s tender, because the master of the shop
was a Juryman in some cases of ours the other day, and we let him
down easy. I reminded him of it when I bought the fowl, and I said,
‘Pick us out a good one, old Briton, because if we had chosen to keep
you in the box another day or two, we could easily have done it.’ He
said to that, ‘Let me make you a present of the best fowl in the shop.’
I let him, of course. As far as it goes, it’s property and portable. You
don’t object to an aged parent, I hope?”
I really thought he was still speaking of the fowl, until he added,
“Because I have got an aged parent at my place.” I then said what
politeness required.
“So you haven’t dined with Mr. Jaggers yet?” he pursued, as we
walked along.
“Not yet.”
“He told me so this afternoon when he heard you were coming. I
expect you’ll have an invitation to-morrow. He’s going to ask your
pals, too. Three of ’em; ain’t there?”
Although I was not in the habit of counting Drummle as one of
my intimate associates, I answered, “Yes.”
“Well, he’s going to ask the whole gang;” I hardly felt complimented by the word; “and whatever he gives you, he’ll give you
xxv] Volume II Chapter VI 187
good. Don’t look forward to variety, but you’ll have excellence. And
there’s another rum thing in his house,” proceeded Wemmick, after
a moment’s pause, as if the remark followed on the housekeeper
understood; “he never lets a door or window be fastened at night.”
“Is he never robbed?”
“That’s it!” returned Wemmick. “He says, and gives it out publicly, ‘I want to see the man who’ll rob me.’ Lord bless you, I have
heard him, a hundred times if I have heard him once, say to regular
cracksmen* in our front office, ‘You know where I live; now, no bolt
is ever drawn there; why don’t you do a stroke of business with me?
Come; can’t I tempt you?’ Not a man of them, sir, would be bold
enough to try it on, for love or money.”
“They dread him so much?” said I.
“Dread him,” said Wemmick. “I believe you they dread him. Not
but what he’s artful, even in his defiance of them. No silver, sir.
Britannia metal,* every spoon.”
“So they wouldn’t have much,” I observed, “even if they––––”
“Ah! But he would have much,” said Wemmick, cutting me short,
“and they know it. He’d have their lives, and the lives of scores of
’em. He’d have all he could get. And it’s impossible to say what he
couldn’t get, if he gave his mind to it.”
I was falling into meditation on my guardian’s greatness, when
Wemmick remarked:
“As to the absence of plate, that’s only his natural depth, you
know. A river’s its natural depth, and he’s his natural depth. Look at
his watch-chain. That’s real enough.”
“It’s very massive,” said I.
“Massive?” repeated Wemmick. “I think so. And his watch is a
gold repeater,* and worth a hundred pound if it’s worth a penny. Mr.
Pip, there are about seven hundred thieves in this town who know all
about that watch; there’s not a man, a woman, or a child, among
them, who wouldn’t identify the smallest link in that chain, and drop
it as if it was red-hot, if inveigled into touching it.”
At first with such discourse, and afterwards with conversation of a
more general nature, did Mr. Wemmick and I beguile the time and
the road, until he gave me to understand that we had arrived in the
district of Walworth.
It appeared to be a collection of back lanes, ditches, and little
gardens, and to present the aspect of a rather dull retirement.*
188 Great Expectations
Wemmick’s house was a little wooden cottage in the midst of plots of
garden, and the top of it was cut out and painted like a battery
mounted with guns.
“My own doing,” said Wemmick. “Looks pretty; don’t it?”
I highly commended it. I think it was the smallest house I ever
saw; with the queerest gothic windows (by far the greater part of
them sham) and a gothic door, almost too small to get in at.
“That’s a real flagstaff, you see,” said Wemmick, “and on Sundays
I run up a real flag. Then look here. After I have crossed this bridge,
I hoist it up––so––and cut off the communication.”
The bridge was a plank, and it crossed a chasm about four feet
wide and two deep. But it was very pleasant to see the pride with
which he hoisted it up and made it fast; smiling as he did so, with a
relish and not merely mechanically.
“At nine o’clock every night, Greenwich time,” said Wemmick,
“the gun fires. There he is, you see! And when you hear him go, I
think you’ll say he’s a Stinger.”*
The piece of ordnance referred to, was mounted in a separate
fortress, constructed of lattice-work. It was protected from the weather by an ingenious little tarpaulin contrivance in the nature of an
umbrella.
“Then, at the back,” said Wemmick, “out of sight, so as not to
impede the idea of fortifications––for it’s a principle with me, if you
have an idea, carry it out and keep it up––I don’t know whether
that’s your opinion––––”
I said, decidedly.
“At the back, there’s a pig, and there are fowls and rabbits; then, I
knock together my own little frame, you see, and grow cucumbers;
and you’ll judge at supper what sort of a salad I can raise. So, sir,”
said Wemmick, smiling again, but seriously too, as he shook his head,
“if you can suppose the little place besieged, it would hold out a devil
of a time in point of provisions.”
Then, he conducted me to a bower about a dozen yards off, but
which was approached by such ingenious twists of path that it took
quite a long time to get at; and in this retreat our glasses were already
set forth. Our punch was cooling in an ornamental lake, on whose
margin the bower was raised. This piece of water (with an island in
the middle which might have been the salad for supper) was of a
circular form, and he had constructed a fountain in it, which, when
xxv] Volume II Chapter VI 189
you set a little mill going and took a cork out of a pipe, played to that
powerful extent that it made the back of your hand quite wet.
“I am my own engineer, and my own carpenter, and my own
plumber, and my own gardener, and my own Jack of all Trades,” said
Wemmick, in acknowledging my compliments. “Well; it’s a good
thing, you know. It brushes the Newgate cobwebs away, and pleases
the Aged. You wouldn’t mind being at once introduced to the Aged,
would you? It wouldn’t put you out?”
I expressed the readiness I felt, and we went into the Castle.
There, we found, sitting by a fire, a very old man in a flannel coat:
clean, cheerful, comfortable, and well cared for, but intensely deaf.
“Well aged parent,” said Wemmick, shaking hands with him in a
cordial and jocose way, “how am you?”
“All right, John; all right!” replied the old man.
“Here’s Mr. Pip, aged parent,” said Wemmick, “and I wish you
could hear his name. Nod away at him, Mr. Pip; that’s what he likes.
Nod away at him, if you please, like winking!”
“This is a fine place of my son’s, sir,” cried the old man, while I
nodded as hard as I possibly could. “This is a pretty pleasureground, sir. This spot and these beautiful works upon it ought to be
kept together by the Nation, after my son’s time, for the people’s
enjoyment.”
“You’re as proud of it as Punch;* ain’t you, Aged?” said Wemmick,
contemplating the old man, with his hard face really softened;
“there’s a nod for you;” giving him a tremendous one; “there’s
another for you;” giving him a still more tremendous one; “you like
that, don’t you? If you’re not tired, Mr. Pip––though I know it’s
tiring to strangers––will you tip him one more? You can’t think how
it pleases him.”
I tipped him several more, and he was in great spirits. We left him
bestirring himself to feed the fowls, and we sat down to our punch in
the arbour; where Wemmick told me as he smoked a pipe that it had
taken him a good many years to bring the property up to its present
pitch of perfection.
“Is it your own, Mr. Wemmick?”
“Oh yes,” said Wemmick, “I have got hold of it, a bit at a time. It’s
a freehold, by George!”
“Is it, indeed? I hope Mr. Jaggers admires it?”
“Never seen it,” said Wemmick. “Never heard of it. Never seen
190 Great Expectations
the Aged. Never heard of him. No; the office is one thing, and
private life is another. When I go into the office, I leave the Castle
behind me, and when I come into the Castle, I leave the office behind
me. If it’s not in any way disagreeable to you, you’ll oblige me by
doing the same. I don’t wish it professionally spoken about.”
Of course I felt my good faith involved in the observance of his
request. The punch being very nice, we sat there drinking it and
talking, until it was almost nine o’clock. “Getting near gun-fire,”
said Wemmick then, as he laid down his pipe; “it’s the Aged’s treat.”
Proceeding into the Castle again, we found the Aged heating the
poker, with expectant eyes, as a preliminary to the performance of
this great nightly ceremony. Wemmick stood with his watch in his
hand, until the moment was come for him to take the red-hot poker
from the Aged, and repair to the battery. He took it, and went out,
and presently the Stinger went off with a Bang that shook the crazy
little box of a cottage as if it must fall to pieces, and made every glass
and teacup in it ring. Upon this, the Aged––who I believe would
have been blown out of his arm-chair but for holding on by the
elbows––cried out exultingly, “He’s fired! I heerd him!” and I nodded at the old gentleman until it is no figure of speech to declare that
I absolutely could not see him.
The interval between that time and supper, Wemmick devoted to
showing me his collection of curiosities. They were mostly of a
felonious character; comprising the pen with which a celebrated
forgery had been committed, a distinguished razor or two, some
locks of hair, and several manuscript confessions written under
condemnation––upon which Mr. Wemmick set particular value as
being, to use his own words, “every one of ’em Lies, sir.” These were
agreeably dispersed among small specimens of china and glass, various neat trifles made by the proprietor of the museum, and some
tobacco-stoppers* carved by the Aged. They were all displayed in that
chamber of the Castle into which I had been first inducted, and
which served, not only as the general sitting-room but as the kitchen
too, if I might judge from a saucepan on the hob, and a brazen bijou
over the fireplace designed for the suspension of a roasting-jack.*
There was a neat little girl in attendance, who looked after the
Aged in the day. When she had laid the supper-cloth, the bridge was
lowered to give her means of egress, and she withdrew for the night.
The supper was excellent; and though the Castle was rather subject
xxv] Volume II Chapter VI 191
to dry-rot insomuch that it tasted like a bad nut, and though the pig
might have been farther off, I was heartily pleased with my whole
entertainment. Nor was there any drawback on my little turret bedroom, beyond there being such a very thin ceiling between me and
the flagstaff, that when I lay down on my back in bed, it seemed as if
I had to balance that pole on my forehead all night.
Wemmick was up early in the morning, and I am afraid I heard
him cleaning my boots. After that, he fell to gardening, and I saw
him from my gothic window pretending to employ the Aged, and
nodding at him in a most devoted manner. Our breakfast was as good
as the supper, and at half-past eight precisely we started for Little
Britain. By degrees, Wemmick got dryer and harder as we went
along, and his mouth tightened into a post-office again. At last, when
we got to his place of business and he pulled out his key from his
coat-collar, he looked as unconscious of his Walworth property as if
the Castle and the drawbridge and the arbour and the lake and the
fountain and the Aged, had all been blown into space together by the
last discharge of the Stinger.
CHAPTER VII
It fell out as Wemmick had told me it would, that I had an early
opportunity of comparing my guardian’s establishment with that of
his cashier and clerk. My guardian was in his room, washing his
hands with his scented soap, when I went into the office from Walworth; and he called me to him, and gave me the invitation for
myself and friends which Wemmick had prepared me to receive.
“No ceremony” he stipulated, “and no dinner dress, and say tomorrow.” I asked him where we should come to (for I had no idea
where he lived), and I believe it was in his general objection to make
anything like an admission, that he replied, “Come here, and I’ll take
you home with me.” I embrace this opportunity of remarking that he
washed his clients off, as if he were a surgeon or a dentist. He had a
closet in his room fitted up for the purpose, which smelt of the
scented soap like a perfumer’s shop. It had an unusually large jacktowel on a roller inside the door, and he would wash his hands, and
wipe them and dry them all over this towel, whenever he came in
from a police-court or dismissed a client from his room. When I and
192 Great Expectations
my friends repaired to him at six o’clock next day, he seemed to have
been engaged on a case of a darker complexion than usual, for, we
found him with his head butted into this closet, not only washing his
hands, but laving his face and gargling his throat. And even when he
had done all that, and had gone all round the jack-towel, he took out
his penknife and scraped the case out of his nails before he put his
coat on.
There were some people slinking about as usual when we passed
out into the street, who were evidently anxious to speak with him;
but there was something so conclusive in the halo of scented soap
which encircled his presence, that they gave it up for that day. As we
walked along westward, he was recognised ever and again by some
face in the crowd of the streets, and whenever that happened he
talked louder to me; but he never otherwise recognised anybody, or
took notice that anybody recognised him.
He conducted us to Gerrard-street, Soho, to a house on the south
side of that street. Rather a stately house of its kind, but dolefully in
want of painting, and with dirty windows. He took out his key and
opened the door, and we all went in to a stone hall, bare, gloomy, and
little used. So, up a dark brown staircase into a series of three dark
brown rooms on the first floor. There were carved garlands on the
panelled walls, and as he stood among them giving us welcome, I
know what kind of loops I thought they looked like.
Dinner was laid in the best of these rooms; the second was his
dressing-room; the third, his bedroom. He told us that he held the
whole house, but rarely used more of it than we saw. The table was
comfortably laid––no silver in the service, of course––and at the side
of his chair was a capacious dumb-waiter,* with a variety of bottles
and decanters on it, and four dishes of fruit for dessert. I noticed
throughout, that he kept everything under his own hand, and distributed everything himself.
There was a bookcase in the room; I saw, from the backs of the
books, that they were about evidence, criminal law, criminal biography, trials, acts of parliament, and such things.* The furniture was
all very solid and good, like his watch-chain. It had an official look,
however, and there was nothing merely ornamental to be seen. In a
corner, was a little table of papers with a shaded lamp: so that he
seemed to bring the office home with him in that respect too, and to
wheel it out of an evening and fall to work.
xxvi] Volume II Chapter VII 193
As he had scarcely seen my three companions until now––for, he
and I had walked together––he stood on the hearth-rug, after ringing
the bell, and took a searching look at them. To my surprise, he
seemed at once to be principally if not solely interested in Drummle.
“Pip,” said he, putting his large hand on my shoulder and moving
me to the window, “I don’t know one from the other. Who’s the
Spider!”
“The spider?” said I.
“The blotchy, sprawly, sulky fellow.”
“That’s Bentley Drummle,” I replied; “the one with the delicate
face is Startop.”
Not making the least account of “the one with the delicate face,”
he returned, “Bentley Drummle is his name, is it? I like the look of
that fellow.”
He immediately began to talk to Drummle; not at all deterred by
his replying in his heavy reticent way, but apparently led on by it to
screw discourse out of him. I was looking at the two, when there
came between me and them, the housekeeper, with the first dish for
the table.
She was a woman of about forty, I supposed––but I may have
thought her younger than she was. Rather tall, of a lithe nimble
figure, extremely pale, with large faded eyes, and a quantity of
streaming hair. I cannot say whether any diseased affection of the
heart caused her lips to be parted as if she were panting, and her face
to bear a curious expression of suddenness and flutter; but I know
that I had been to see Macbeth at the theatre, a night or two before,
and that her face looked to me as if it were all disturbed by fiery air,
like the faces I had seen rise out of the Witches’ caldron.*
She set the dish on, touched my guardian quietly on the arm with
a finger to notify that dinner was ready, and vanished. We took our
seats at the round table, and my guardian kept Drummle on one side
of him, while Startop sat on the other. It was a noble dish of fish that
the housekeeper had put on table, and we had a joint of equally
choice mutton afterwards, and then an equally choice bird. Sauces,
wines, all the accessories we wanted, and all of the best, were given
out by our host from his dumb-waiter; and when they had made the
circuit of the table, he always put them back again. Similarly, he dealt
us clean plates and knives and forks, for each course, and dropped
those just disused into two baskets on the ground by his chair. No
194 Great Expectations
other attendant than the housekeeper appeared. She set on every
dish; and I always saw in her face, a face rising out of the caldron.
Years afterwards, I made a dreadful likeness of that woman, by causing a face that had no other natural resemblance to it than it derived
from flowing hair, to pass behind a bowl of flaming spirits in a dark
room.*
Induced to take particular notice of the housekeeper, both by her
own striking appearance and by Wemmick’s preparation, I observed
that whenever she was in the room, she kept her eyes attentively on
my guardian, and that she would remove her hands from any dish
she put before him, hesitatingly, as if she dreaded his calling her
back, and wanted him to speak when she was nigh, if he had anything to say. I fancied that I could detect in his manner a consciousness of this, and a purpose of always holding her in suspense.
Dinner went off gaily, and, although my guardian seemed to follow rather than originate subjects, I knew that he wrenched the
weakest part of our dispositions out of us. For myself, I found that I
was expressing my tendency to lavish expenditure, and to patronise
Herbert, and to boast of my great prospects, before I quite knew that
I had opened my lips. It was so with all of us, but with no one more
than Drummle: the development of whose inclination to gird in a
grudging and suspicious way at the rest, was screwed out of him
before the fish was taken off.
It was not then, but when we had got to the cheese, that our
conversation turned upon our rowing feats, and that Drummle was
rallied for coming up behind of a night in that slow amphibious way
of his. Drummle upon this, informed our host that he much preferred our room to our company, and that as to skill he was more
than our master, and that as to strength he could scatter us like chaff.
By some invisible agency, my guardian wound him up to a pitch little
short of ferocity about this trifle; and he fell to baring and spanning
his arm to show how muscular it was, and we all fell to baring and
spanning our arms in a ridiculous manner.
Now, the housekeeper was at that time clearing the table; my
guardian, taking no heed of her, but with the side of his face turned
from her, was leaning back in his chair biting the side of his forefinger and showing an interest in Drummle, that, to me, was quite inexplicable. Suddenly, he clapped his large hand on the housekeeper’s
like a trap, as she stretched it across the table. So suddenly and
xxvi] Volume II Chapter VII 195
smartly did he do this, that we all stopped in our foolish contention.
“If you talk of strength,” said Mr. Jaggers, “I’ll show you a wrist.
Molly, let them see your wrist.”
Her entrapped hand was on the table, but she had already put her
other hand behind her waist. “Master,” she said, in a low voice, with
her eyes attentively and entreatingly fixed upon him. “Don’t!”
“I’ll show you a wrist,” repeated Mr. Jaggers, with an immovable
determination to show it. “Molly, let them see your wrist.”
“Master,” she again murmured. “Please!”
“Molly,” said Mr. Jaggers, not looking at her, but obstinately looking at the opposite side of the room, “let them see both your wrists.
Show them. Come!”
He took his hand from hers, and turned that wrist up on the table.
She brought her other hand from behind her, and held the two out
side by side. The last wrist was much disfigured––deeply seamed
and scarred across and across. When she held her hands out, she took
her eyes from Mr. Jaggers, and turned them watchfully on every one
of the rest of us in succession.
“There’s power here,” said Mr. Jaggers, coolly tracing out the
sinews with his forefinger. “Very few men have the power of wrist
that this woman has. It’s remarkable what mere force of grip there is
in these hands. I have had occasion to notice many hands; but I never
saw stronger in that respect, man’s or woman’s, than these.”
While he said these words in a leisurely critical style, she continued to look at every one of us in regular succession as we sat. The
moment he ceased, she looked at him again. “That’ll do, Molly,” said
Mr. Jaggers, giving her a slight nod; “you have been admired, and
can go.” She withdrew her hands and went out of the room, and Mr.
Jaggers, putting the decanters on from his dumb-waiter, filled his
glass and passed round the wine.
“At half-past nine, gentlemen,” said he, “we must break up. Pray
make the best use of your time. I am glad to see you all. Mr.
Drummle, I drink to you.”
If his object in singling out Drummle were to bring him out still
more, it perfectly succeeded. In a sulky triumph, Drummle showed
his morose depreciation of the rest of us, in a more and more offensive degree until he became downright intolerable. Through all his
stages, Mr. Jaggers followed him with the same strange interest. He
actually seemed to serve as a zest to Mr. Jaggers’s wine.
196 Great Expectations
In our boyish want of discretion I dare say we took too much to
drink, and I know we talked too much. We became particularly hot
upon some boorish sneer of Drummle’s, to the effect that we were
too free with our money. It led to my remarking, with more zeal than
discretion, that it came with a bad grace from him, to whom Startop
had lent money in my presence but a week or so before.
“Well,” retorted Drummle; “he’ll be paid.”
“I don’t mean to imply that he won’t,” said I, “but it might make
you hold your tongue about us and our money, I should think.”
“You should think!” retorted Drummle. “Oh Lord!”
“I dare say,” I went on, meaning to be very severe, “that you
wouldn’t lend money to any of us, if we wanted it.”
“You are right,” said Drummle. “I wouldn’t lend one of you a
sixpence. I wouldn’t lend anybody a sixpence.”
“Rather mean to borrow under those circumstances, I should say.”
“You should say,” repeated Drummle. “Oh Lord!”
This was so very aggravating––the more especially as I found
myself making no way against his surly obtuseness––that I said,
disregarding Herbert’s efforts to check me:
“Come, Mr. Drummle, since we are on the subject, I’ll tell you
what passed between Herbert here and me, when you borrowed that
money.”
“I don’t want to know what passed between Herbert there and
you,” growled Drummle. And I think he added in a lower growl, that
we might both go to the devil and shake ourselves.*
“I’ll tell you, however,” said I, “whether you want to know or not.
We said that as you put it in your pocket very glad to get it, you
seemed to be immensely amused at his being so weak as to lend it.”*
Drummle laughed outright, and sat laughing in our faces, with his
hands in his pockets and his round shoulders raised: plainly signifying that it was quite true, and that he despised us, as asses all.
Hereupon Startop took him in hand, though with a much better
grace than I had shown, and exhorted him to be a little more agreeable. Startop, being a lively bright young fellow, and Drummle being
the exact opposite, the latter was always disposed to resent him as a
direct personal affront. He now retorted in a coarse lumpish way,
and Startop tried to turn the discussion aside with some small pleasantry that made us all laugh. Resenting this little success more than
anything, Drummle, without any threat or warning, pulled his hands
xxvi] Volume II Chapter VII 197
out of his pockets, dropped his round shoulders, swore, took up a
large glass, and would have flung it at his adversary’s head, but for
our entertainer’s dexterously seizing it at the instant when it was
raised for that purpose.
“Gentlemen,” said Mr. Jaggers, deliberately putting down the
glass, and hauling out his gold repeater by its massive chain, “I am
exceedingly sorry to announce that it’s half-past nine.”
On this hint we all rose to depart. Before we got to the street door,
Startop was cheerily calling Drummle “old boy,” as if nothing had
happened. But the old boy was so far from responding, that he would
not even walk to Hammersmith on the same side of the way; so,
Herbert and I, who remained in town, saw them going down the
street on opposite sides; Startop leading, and Drummle lagging
behind in the shadow of the houses, much as he was wont to follow
in his boat.
As the door was not yet shut, I thought I would leave Herbert
there for a moment, and run up-stairs again to say a word to my
guardian. I found him in his dressing-room surrounded by his stock
of boots, already hard at it, washing his hands of us.
I told him I had come up again, to say how sorry I was that
anything disagreeable should have occurred, and that I hoped he
would not blame me much.
“Pooh!” said he, sluicing his face, and speaking through the waterdrops; “it’s nothing, Pip. I like that Spider though.”
He had turned towards me now, and was shaking his head, and
blowing, and towelling himself.
“I am glad you like him, sir,” said I––“but I don’t.”
“No, no,” my guardian assented; “don’t have too much to do
with him. Keep as clear of him as you can. But I like the fellow, Pip;
he is one of the true sort. Why, if I was a fortune-teller––––”
Looking out of the towel, he caught my eye.
“But I am not a fortune-teller,” he said, letting his head drop into
a festoon of towel, and towelling away at his two ears. “You know
what I am, don’t you? Good night, Pip.”
“Good night, sir.”
In about a month after that, the Spider’s time with Mr. Pocket was
up for good, and, to the great relief of all the house but Mrs. Pocket,
he went home to the family hole.
198 Great Expectations
CHAPTER VIII
“My Dear Mr. Pip,
“I write this by request of Mr. Gargery, for to let you know that he is
going to London in company of Mr. Wopsle and would be glad if agreeable to be allowed to see you. He would call at Barnard’s Hotel Tuesday
morning 9 o’clock, when if not agreeable please leave word. Your poor
sister is much the same as when you left. We talk of you in the kitchen
every night, and wonder what you are saying and doing. If now considered
in the light of a liberty, excuse it for the love of poor old days. No more,
dear Mr. Pip, from
“Your ever obliged, and affectionate
“Servant,
“Biddy.
“P.S. He wishes me most particular to write what larks. He says you will
understand. I hope and do not doubt it will be agreeable to see him even
though a gentleman, for you had ever a good heart and he is a worthy
worthy man. I have read him all, excepting only the last little sentence,
and he wishes me most particular to write again what larks.”
I received this letter by the post on Monday morning, and therefore its appointment was for next day. Let me confess exactly, with
what feelings I looked forward to Joe’s coming.
Not with pleasure, though I was bound to him by so many ties; no;
with considerable disturbance, some mortification, and a keen sense
of incongruity. If I could have kept him away by paying money, I
certainly would have paid money. My greatest reassurance was, that
he was coming to Barnard’s Inn, not to Hammersmith, and consequently would not fall in Bentley Drummle’s way. I had little
objection to his being seen by Herbert or his father, for both of
whom I had a respect; but I had the sharpest sensitiveness as to his
being seen by Drummle, whom I held in contempt. So, throughout
life, our worst weaknesses and meannesses are usually committed for
the sake of the people whom we most despise.
I had begun to be always decorating the chambers in some quite
unnecessary and inappropriate way or other, and very expensive
those wrestles with Barnard proved to be. By this time, the rooms
were vastly different from what I had found them, and I enjoyed the
honour of occupying a few prominent pages in the books of a
xxvii] Volume II Chapter VIII 199
neighbouring upholsterer. I had got on so fast of late, that I had even
started a boy in boots*––top boots––in bondage and slavery to
whom I might have been said to pass my days. For, after I had made
the monster (out of the refuse of my washerwoman’s family) and had
clothed him with a blue coat, canary waistcoat, white cravat, creamy
breeches, and the boots already mentioned, I had to find him a little
to do and a great deal to eat; and with both of those horrible
requirements he haunted my existence.
This avenging phantom* was ordered to be on duty at eight on
Tuesday morning in the hall (it was two feet square, as charged for
floorcloth, and Herbert suggested certain things for breakfast that he
thought Joe would like. While I felt sincerely obliged to him for
being so interested and considerate, I had an odd half-provoked
sense of suspicion upon me, that if Joe had been coming to see him,
he wouldn’t have been quite so brisk about it.
However, I came into town on the Monday night to be ready for
Joe, and I got up early in the morning, and caused the sitting-room
and breakfast-table to assume their most splendid appearance.
Unfortunately the morning was drizzly, and an angel could not have
concealed the fact that Barnard was shedding sooty tears outside the
window, like some weak giant of a Sweep.
As the time approached I should have liked to run away, but the
Avenger pursuant to orders was in the hall, and presently I heard Joe
on the staircase. I knew it was Joe, by his clumsy manner of coming
up-stairs––his state boots being always too big for him––and by the
time it took him to read the names on the other floors in the course
of his ascent. When at last he stopped outside our door, I could hear
his finger tracing over the painted letters of my name, and I afterwards distinctly heard him breathing in at the keyhole. Finally he
gave a faint single rap, and Pepper––such was the compromising
name of the avenging boy––announced, “Mr. Gargery!” I thought
he never would have done wiping his feet, and that I must have gone
out to lift him off the mat, but at last he came in.
“Joe, how are you, Joe?”
“Pip, how air you, Pip?”
With his good honest face all glowing and shining, and his hat put
down on the floor between us, he caught both my hands and worked
them straight up and down, as if I had been the last-patented Pump.
“I am glad to see you, Joe. Give me your hat.”
200 Great Expectations
But Joe, taking it up carefully with both hands, like a bird’s-nest
with eggs in it, wouldn’t hear of parting with that piece of property,
and persisted in standing talking over it in a most uncomfortable
way.
“Which you have that growed,” said Joe, “and that swelled, and
that gentlefolked;” Joe considered a little before he discovered this
word; “as to be sure you are a honour to your king and country.”
“And you, Joe, look wonderfully well.”
“Thank God,” said Joe, “I’m ekerval to most. And your sister,
she’s no worse than she were. And Biddy, she’s ever right and ready.
And all friends is no backerder, if not no forarder. ’Ceptin’ Wopsle;
he’s had a drop.”
All this time (still with both hands taking great care of the bird’snest), Joe was rolling his eyes round and round the room, and round
and round the flowered pattern of my dressing-gown.
“Had a drop, Joe?”
“Why yes,” said Joe, lowering his voice, “he’s left the Church, and
went into the playacting. Which the playacting have likeways
brought him to London along with me. And his wish were,” said Joe,
getting the bird’s-nest under his left arm for the moment and groping in it for an egg with his right; “if no offence, as I would ’and you
that.”
I took what Joe gave me, and found it to be the crumpled playbill
of a small metropolitan theatre, announcing the first appearance, in
that very week, of “the celebrated Provincial Amateur of Roscian
renown,* whose unique performance in the highest tragic walk of
our National Bard has lately occasioned so great a sensation in local
dramatic circles.”
“Were you at his performance, Joe?” I inquired.
“I were,” said Joe, with emphasis and solemnity.
“Was there a great sensation?”
“Why,” said Joe, “yes, there certainly were a peck of orange-peel.*
Partickler, when he see the ghost.* Though I put it to yourself, sir,
whether it were calc’lated to keep a man up to his work with a good
hart, to be continiwally cutting in betwixt him and the Ghost with
‘Amen!’ A man may have had a misfortun’ and been in the Church,”
said Joe, lowering his voice to an argumentative and feeling tone,
“but that is no reason why you should put him out at such a time.
Which I meantersay, if the ghost of a man’s own father cannot be
xxvii] Volume II Chapter VIII 201
allowed to claim his attention, what can, Sir? Still more, when his
mourning ’at is unfortunately made so small as that the weight of the
black feathers brings it off, try to keep it on how you may.”
A ghost-seeing effect in Joe’s own countenance informed me that
Herbert had entered the room. So, I presented Joe to Herbert, who
held out his hand; but Joe backed from it, and held on by the bird’snest.
“Your servant, Sir,” said Joe, “which I hope as you and Pip”––
here his eye fell on the Avenger, who was putting some toast on table,
and so plainly denoted an intention to make that young gentleman
one of the family, that I frowned it down and confused him more––
“I meantersay, you two gentlemen––which I hope as you get your
elths in this close spot? For the present may be a wery good inn,
according to London opinions,” said Joe, confidentially, “and I
believe its character do stand i; but I wouldn’t keep a pig in it
myself––not in the case that I wished him to fatten wholesome and
to eat with a meller flavour on him.”
Having borne this flattering testimony to the merits of our
dwelling-place, and having incidentally shown this tendency to call
me “sir,” Joe, being invited to sit down to table, looked all round the
room for a suitable spot on which to deposit his hat––as if it were
only on some very few rare substances in nature that it could find a
resting-place––and ultimately stood it on an extreme corner of the
chimney-piece, from which it ever afterwards fell off at intervals.
“Do you take tea, or coffee, Mr. Gargery?” asked Herbert, who
always presided of a morning.
“Thankee, Sir,” said Joe, stiff from head to foot, “I’ll take whichever is most agreeable to yourself.”
“What do you say to coffee?”
“Thankee, Sir,” returned Joe, evidently dispirited by the proposal,
“since you are so kind as make chice of coffee, I will not run contrairy to your own opinions. But don’t you never find it a little
’eating?”
“Say tea then,” said Herbert, pouring it out.
Here Joe’s hat tumbled off the mantelpiece, and he started out of
his chair and picked it up, and fitted it to the same exact spot. As if it
were an absolute point of good breeding that it should tumble off
again soon.
“When did you come to town, Mr. Gargery?”
202 Great Expectations
“Were it yesterday afternoon?” said Joe, after coughing behind his
hand, as if he had had time to catch the whooping-cough since he
came. “No it were not. Yes it were. Yes. It were yesterday afternoon”
(with an appearance of mingled wisdom, relief, and strict
impartiality).
“Have you seen anything of London, yet?”
“Why, yes, Sir,” said Joe, “me and Wopsle went off straight to look
at the Blacking Ware’us.* But we didn’t find that it come up to its
likeness in the red bills at the shop doors; which I meantersay,”
added Joe, in an explanatory manner, “as it is there drawd too
architectooralooral.”
I really believe Joe would have prolonged this word (mightily
expressive to my mind of some architecture that I know) into a
perfect Chorus,* but for his attention being providentially attracted
by his hat, which was toppling. Indeed, it demanded from him a
constant attention, and a quickness of eye and hand, very like that
exacted by wicket-keeping. He made extraordinary play with it, and
showed the greatest skill; now, rushing at it and catching it neatly as
it dropped; now, merely stopping it midway, beating it up, and
humouring it in various parts of the room and against a good deal of
the pattern of the paper on the wall, before he felt it safe to close
with it; finally, splashing it into the slop-basin,* where I took the
liberty of laying hands upon it.
As to his shirt-collar and his coat-collar, they were perplexing to
reflect upon––insoluble mysteries both. Why should a man scrape
himself to that extent,* before he could consider himself full
dressed? Why should he suppose it necessary to be purified by suffering for his holiday clothes? Then he fell into such unaccountable
fits of meditation, with his fork midway between his plate and his
mouth; had his eyes attracted in such strange directions; was
afflicted with such remarkable coughs; sat so far from the table, and
dropped so much more than he ate, and pretended that he hadn’t
dropped it; that I was heartily glad when Herbert left us for the City.
I had neither the good sense nor the good feeling to know that this
was all my fault, and that if I had been easier with Joe, Joe would
have been easier with me. I felt impatient of him and out of temper
with him; in which condition he heaped coals of fire on my head.*
“Us two being now alone, Sir,”––began Joe.
“Joe,” I interrupted, pettishly, “how can you call me, Sir?”
xxvii] Volume II Chapter VIII 203
Joe looked at me for a single instant with something faintly like
reproach. Utterly preposterous as his cravat was, and as his collars
were, I was conscious of a sort of dignity in the look.
“Us two being now alone,” resumed Joe, “and me having the
intentions and abilities to stay not many minutes more, I will now
conclude––leastways begin––to mention what have led to my having
had the present honour. For was it not,” said Joe, with his old air of
lucid exposition, “that my only wish were to be useful to you, I
should not have had the honour of breaking wittles in the company
and abode of gentlemen.”
I was so unwilling to see the look again, that I made no remonstrance against this tone.
“Well, Sir,” pursued Joe, “this is how it were. I were at the Bargemen t’other night, Pip;” whenever he subsided into affection, he
called me Pip, and whenever he relapsed into politeness he called me
Sir; “when there come up in his shay-cart, Pumblechook. Which
that same identical,” said Joe, going down a new track, “do comb my
’air the wrong way sometimes, awful, by giving out up and down
town as it were him which ever had your infant companionation and
were looked upon as a playfeller by yourself.”
“Nonsense. It was you, Joe.”
“Which I fully believed it were, Pip,” said Joe, slightly tossing his
head, “though it signify little now, Sir. Well, Pip; this same identical,
which his manners is given to blusterous, come to me at the Bargemen (wot a pipe and a pint of beer do give refreshment to the
working-man, Sir, and do not over stimilate), and his word were,
‘Joseph, Miss Havisham she wish to speak to you.’ ”
“Miss Havisham, Joe?”
“ ‘She wish,’ were Pumblechook’s word, ‘to speak to you.’ ” Joe sat
and rolled his eyes at the ceiling.
“Yes, Joe? Go on, please.”
“Next day, Sir,” said Joe, looking at me as if I were a long way off,
“having cleaned myself, I go and I see Miss A.”
“Miss A., Joe? Miss Havisham?”
“Which I say, Sir,” replied Joe, with an air of legal formality, as if
he were making his will, “Miss A., or otherways Havisham. Her
expression air then as follering: ‘Mr. Gargery. You air in correspondence with Mr. Pip?’ Having had a letter from you, I were able to say
‘I am.’ (When I married your sister, Sir, I said ‘I will;’ and when I
204 Great Expectations
answered your friend, Pip, I said ‘I am.’) ‘Would you tell him, then,’
said she, ‘that which Estella has come home and would be glad to see
him.’ ”
I felt my face fire up as I looked at Joe. I hope one remote cause of
its firing, may have been my consciousness that if I had known his
errand, I should have given him more encouragement.
“Biddy,” pursued Joe, “when I got home and asked her fur to
write the message to you, a little hung back. Biddy says ‘I know he
will be very glad to have it by word of mouth, it is holiday-time, you
want to see him, go!’ I have now concluded, Sir,” said Joe, rising
from his chair, “and, Pip, I wish you ever well and ever prospering to
a greater and a greater heighth.”
“But you are not going now, Joe?”
“Yes I am,” said Joe.
“But you are coming back to dinner, Joe?”
“No I am not,” said Joe.
Our eyes met, and all the “Sir” melted out of that manly heart as
he gave me his hand.
“Pip, dear old chap, life is made of ever so many partings welded
together, as I may say, and one man’s a blacksmith, and one’s a
whitesmith,* and one’s a goldsmith, and one’s a coppersmith. Diwisions among such must come, and must be met as they come. If
there’s been any fault at all to-day, it’s mine. You and me is not two
figures to be together in London; nor yet anywheres else but what is
private, and beknown, and understood among friends. It ain’t that I
am proud, but that I want to be right, as you shall never see me no
more in these clothes. I’m wrong in these clothes. I’m wrong out of
the forge, the kitchen, or off th’ meshes. You won’t find half so much
fault in me if you think of me in my forge dress, with my hammer in
my hand, or even my pipe. You won’t find half so much fault in me
if, supposing as you should ever wish to see me, you come and put
your head in at the forge winder and see Joe the blacksmith, there, at
the old anvil, in the old burnt apron, sticking to the old work. I’m
awful dull, but I hope I’ve beat out something nigh the rights of this
at last. And so God bless you, dear old Pip, old chap, God bless
you!”
I had not been mistaken in my fancy that there was a simple
dignity in him. The fashion of his dress could no more come in its
way when he spoke these words, than it could come in its way in
xxvii] Volume II Chapter VIII 205
Heaven. He touched me gently on the forehead, and went out. As
soon as I could recover myself sufficiently, I hurried out after him
and looked for him in the neighbouring streets; but he was gone.
CHAPTER IX
It was clear that I must repair to our town next day, and in the first
flow of my repentance it was equally clear that I must stay at Joe’s.
But, when I had secured my box-place* by to-morrow’s coach and
had been down to Mr. Pocket’s and back, I was not by any means
convinced on the last point, and began to invent reasons and make
excuses for putting up at the Blue Boar. I should be an inconvenience
at Joe’s; I was not expected, and my bed would not be ready; I should
be too far from Miss Havisham’s, and she was exacting and mightn’t
like it. All other swindlers upon earth are nothing to the selfswindlers, and with such pretences did I cheat myself. Surely a
curious thing. That I should innocently take a bad half-crown of
somebody else’s manufacture, is reasonable enough; but that I
should knowingly reckon the spurious coin of my own make, as good
money! An obliging stranger, under pretence of compactly folding
up my bank-notes for security’s sake, abstracts the notes and gives
me nutshells; but what is his sleight of hand to mine, when I fold up
my own nutshells and pass them on myself as notes!
Having settled that I must go to the Blue Boar, my mind was much
disturbed by indecision whether or no to take the Avenger. It was
tempting to think of that expensive Mercenary publicly airing his
boots in the archway of the Blue Boar’s posting-yard; it was almost
solemn to imagine him casually produced in the tailor’s shop and
confounding the disrespectful senses of Trabb’s boy. On the other
hand, Trabb’s boy might worm himself into his intimacy and tell
him things; or, reckless and desperate wretch as I knew he could be,
might hoot him in the High-street. My patroness, too, might hear of
him, and not approve. On the whole, I resolved to leave the Avenger
behind.
It was the afternoon coach by which I had taken my place, and, as
winter had now come round, I should not arrive at my destination
until two or three hours after dark. Our time of starting from the
Cross Keys was two o’clock. I arrived on the ground with a quarter
206 Great Expectations
of an hour to spare, attended by the Avenger––if I may connect that
expression with one who never attended on me if he could possibly
help it.
At that time it was customary to carry Convicts down to the
dockyards by stage-coach. As I had often heard of them in the capacity of outside passengers, and had more than once seen them on
the high road dangling their ironed legs over the coach roof, I had no
cause to be surprised when Herbert, meeting me in the yard, came
up and told me there were two convicts going down with me. But I
had a reason that was an old reason now, for constitutionally faltering
whenever I heard the word convict.
“You don’t mind them, Handel?” said Herbert.
“Oh no!”
“I thought you seemed as if you didn’t like them?”
“I can’t pretend that I do like them, and I suppose you don’t
particularly. But I don’t mind them.”
“See! There they are,” said Herbert, “coming out of the Tap.*
What a degraded and vile sight it is!”
They had been treating their guard, I suppose, for they had a
gaoler with them, and all three came out wiping their mouths on
their hands. The two convicts were handcuffed together, and had
irons on their legs––irons of a pattern that I knew well. They wore
the dress that I likewise knew well. Their keeper had a brace of
pistols, and carried a thick-knobbed bludgeon under his arm; but he
was on terms of good understanding with them, and stood, with
them beside him, looking on at the putting-to of the horses, rather
with an air as if the convicts were an interesting Exhibition not
formally open at the moment, and he the Curator. One was a taller
and stouter man than the other, and appeared as a matter of course,
according to the mysterious ways of the world both convict and free,
to have had allotted to him the smaller suit of clothes. His arms and
legs were like great pincushions of those shapes, and his attire disguised him absurdly; but I knew his half-closed eye at one glance.
There stood the man whom I had seen on the settle at the Three
Jolly Bargemen on a Saturday night, and who had brought me down
with his invisible gun!
It was easy to make sure that as yet he knew me no more than if he
had never seen me in his life. He looked across at me, and his eye
appraised my watch-chain, and then he incidentally spat and said
xxviii] Volume II Chapter IX 207
something to the other convict, and they laughed and slued themselves round with a clink of their coupling manacle, and looked at
something else. The great numbers on their backs, as if they were
street doors; their coarse mangy ungainly outer surface, as if they
were lower animals; their ironed legs, apologetically garlanded with
pocket-handkerchiefs; and the way in which all present looked at
them and kept from them; made them (as Herbert had said) a most
disagreeable and degraded spectacle.
But this was not the worst of it. It came out that the whole of the
back of the coach had been taken by a family removing from London, and that there were no places for the two prisoners but on the
seat in front, behind the coachman. Hereupon, a choleric gentleman,
who had taken the fourth place on that seat, flew into a most violent
passion, and said that it was a breach of contract to mix him up with
such villainous company, and that it was poisonous and pernicious
and infamous and shameful, and I don’t know what else. At this time
the coach was ready and the coachman impatient, and we were all
preparing to get up, and the prisoners had come over with their
keeper––bringing with them that curious flavour of bread-poultice,
baize, rope-yarn, and hearthstone, which attends the convict
presence.*
“Don’t take it so much amiss, sir,” pleaded the keeper to the angry
passenger; “I’ll sit next you myself. I’ll put ’em on the outside of the
row. They won’t interfere with you, sir. You needn’t know they’re
there.”
“And don’t blame me,” growled the convict I had recognised. “I
don’t want to go. I am quite ready to stay behind. As fur as I am
concerned any one’s welcome to my place.”
“Or, mine,” said the other, gruffly. “I wouldn’t have incommoded
none of you, if I’d a had my way.” Then, they both laughed, and
began cracking nuts, and spitting the shells about.––As I really think
I should have liked to do myself, if I had been in their place and so
despised.
At length, it was voted that there was no help for the angry
gentleman, and that he must either go in his chance company or
remain behind. So, he got into his place, still making complaints, and
the keeper got into the place next him, and the convicts hauled
themselves up as well as they could, and the convict I had recognised
sat behind me with his breath on the hair of my head.
208 Great Expectations
“Good-by, Handel!” Herbert called out as we started. I thought
what a blessed fortune it was, that he had found another name for me
than Pip.
It is impossible to express with what acuteness I felt the convict’s
breathing, not only on the back of my head, but all along my spine.
The sensation was like being touched in the marrow with some
pungent and searching acid, and it set my very teeth on edge. He
seemed to have more breathing business to do than another man, and
to make more noise in doing it; and I was conscious of growing highshouldered on one side, in my shrinking endeavours to fend him off.
The weather was miserably raw, and the two cursed the cold. It
made us all lethargic before we had gone far, and when we had left
the Half-way House behind, we habitually dozed and shivered and
were silent. I dozed off, myself, in considering the question whether
I ought to restore a couple of pounds sterling to this creature before
losing sight of him, and how it could best be done. In the act of
dipping forward as if I were going to bathe among the horses, I woke
in a fright and took the question up again.
But I must have lost it longer than I had thought, since, although I
could recognise nothing in the darkness and the fitful lights and
shadows of our lamps, I traced marsh country in the cold damp wind
that blew at us. Cowering forward for warmth and to make me a
screen against the wind, the convicts were closer to me than before.
The very first words I heard them interchange as I became conscious
were the words of my own thought, “Two One Pound notes.”
“How did he get ’em?” said the convict I had never seen.
“How should I know?” returned the other. “He had ’em stowed
away somehows. Giv him by friends, I expect.”
“I wish,” said the other, with a bitter curse upon the cold, “that I
had ’em here.”
“Two one pound notes, or friends?”
“Two one pound notes. I’d sell all the friends I ever had, for one,
and think it a blessed good bargain. Well? So he says––––?”
“So he says,” resumed the convict I had recognised––“it was all
said and done in half a minute, behind a pile of timber in the
Dockyard––‘You’re a going to be discharged?’ Yes, I was. Would I
find out that boy that had fed him and kep his secret, and give him
them two one pound notes? Yes, I would. And I did.”
“More fool you,” growled the other. “I’d have spent ’em on a
xxviii] Volume II Chapter IX 209
Man, in wittles and drink. He must have been a green one. Mean to
say he knowed nothing of you?”
“Not a ha’porth. Different gangs and different ships. He was tried
again for prison breaking, and got made a Lifer.”*
“And was that––Honour!––the only time you worked out, in this
part of the country?”
“The only time.”
“What might have been your opinion of the place?”
“A most beastly place. Mudbank, mist, swamp and work; work,
swamp, mist, and mudbank.”
They both execrated the place in very strong language, and gradually growled themselves out, and had nothing left to say.
After overhearing this dialogue, I should assuredly have got down
and been left in the solitude and darkness of the highway, but for
feeling certain that the man had no suspicion of my identity. Indeed,
I was not only so changed in the course of nature, but so differently
dressed and so differently circumstanced, that it was not at all likely
he could have known me without accidental help. Still, the coincidence of our being together on the coach, was sufficiently strange to
fill me with a dread that some other coincidence might at any
moment connect me, in his hearing, with my name. For this reason, I
resolved to alight as soon as we touched the town, and put myself out
of his hearing. This device I executed successfully. My little portmanteau was in the boot under my feet; I had but to turn a hinge to
get it out; I threw it down before me, got down after it, and was left
at the first lamp on the first stones of the town pavement. As to the
convicts, they went their way with the coach, and I knew at what
point they would be spirited off to the river. In my fancy, I saw the
boat with its convict crew waiting for them at the slime-washed
stairs,––again heard the gruff “Give way, you!” like an order to
dogs––again saw the wicked Noah’s Ark lying out on the black water.
I could not have said what I was afraid of, for my fear was
altogether undefined and vague, but there was great fear upon me.
As I walked on to the hotel, I felt that a dread, much exceeding the
mere apprehension of a painful or disagreeable recognition, made
me tremble. I am confident that it took no distinctness of shape, and
that it was the revival for a few minutes of the terror of childhood.
The coffee-room at the Blue Boar was empty, and I had not only
ordered my dinner there, but had sat down to it, before the waiter
210 Great Expectations
knew me. As soon as he had apologised for the remissness of his
memory, he asked me if he should send Boots* for Mr. Pumblechook?
“No,” said I, “certainly not.”
The waiter (it was he who had brought up the Great Remonstrance* from the Commercials, on the day when I was bound)
appeared surprised, and took the earliest opportunity of putting a
dirty old copy of a local newspaper so directly in my way, that I took
it up and read this paragraph:
“Our readers will learn, not altogether without interest, in reference to the
recent romantic rise in fortune of a young artificer in iron of this neighbourhood (what a theme, by the way, for the magic pen of our as yet not
universally acknowledged townsman Tooby, the poet of our columns!)
that the youth’s earliest patron, companion, and friend, was a highlyrespected individual not entirely unconnected with the corn and seed
trade, and whose eminently convenient and commodious business premises are situate within a hundred miles of the High-street. It is not wholly
irrespective of our personal feelings that we record Him as the Mentor of
our young Telemachus,* for it is good to know that our town produced the
founder of the latter’s fortunes. Does the thought-contracted brow of the
local Sage or the lustrous eye of local Beauty inquire whose fortunes? We
believe that Quintin Matsys* was the Blacksmith of Antwerp. Verb.
Sap.*”
I entertain a conviction, based upon large experience, that if in the
days of my prosperity I had gone to the North Pole, I should have
met somebody there, wandering Esquimaux or civilised man, who
would have told me that Pumblechook was my earliest patron and
the founder of my fortunes.
CHAPTER X
Betimes in the morning I was up and out. It was too early yet to
go to Miss Havisham’s, so I loitered into the country on Miss
Havisham’s side of town––which was not Joe’s side; I could go there
to-morrow––thinking about my patroness, and painting brilliant
pictures of her plans for me.
She had adopted Estella, she had as good as adopted me, and it
could not fail to be her intention to bring us together. She reserved it
for me to restore the desolate house, admit the sunshine into the dark
xxix] Volume II Chapter X 211
rooms, set the clocks a going and the cold hearths a blazing, tear
down the cobwebs, destroy the vermin––in short, do all the shining
deeds of the young Knight of romance, and marry the Princess.* I had
stopped to look at the house as I passed; and its seared red brick
walls, blocked windows, and strong green ivy clasping even the
stacks of chimneys with its twigs and tendons, as if with sinewy old
arms, had made up a rich attractive mystery, of which I was the hero.
Estella was the inspiration of it, and the heart of it, of course. But,
though she had taken such strong possession of me, though my fancy
and my hope were so set upon her, though her influence on my
boyish life and character had been all-powerful, I did not, even that
romantic morning, invest her with any attributes save those she possessed. I mention this in this place, of a fixed purpose, because it is
the clue by which I am to be followed into my poor labyrinth.*
According to my experience, the conventional notion of a lover cannot be always true. The unqualified truth is, that when I loved
Estella with the love of a man, I loved her simply because I found her
irresistible. Once for all; I knew to my sorrow, often and often, if not
always, that I loved her against reason, against promise, against
peace, against hope, against happiness, against all discouragement
that could be. Once for all; I loved her none the less because I knew
it, and it had no more influence in restraining me, than if I had
devoutly believed her to be human perfection.
I so shaped out my walk as to arrive at the gate at my old time.
When I had rung at the bell with an unsteady hand, I turned my
back upon the gate, while I tried to get my breath and keep the
beating of my heart moderately quiet. I heard the side door open,
and steps come across the court-yard; but I pretended not to hear,
even when the gate swung on its rusty hinges.
Being at last touched on the shoulder, I started and turned. I
started much more naturally then, to find myself confronted by a
man in a sober grey dress. The last man I should have expected to see
in that place of porter at Miss Havisham’s door.
“Orlick!”
“Ah, young master, there’s more changes than yours. But come in,
come in. It’s opposed to my orders to hold the gate open.”
I entered and he swung it, and locked it, and took the key out.
“Yes!” said he, facing round, after doggedly preceding me a few steps
towards the house. “Here I am!”
212 Great Expectations
“How did you come here?”
“I come here,” he retorted, “on my legs. I had my box brought
alongside me in a barrow.”
“Are you here for good?”
“I ain’t here for harm, young master, I suppose?”
I was not so sure of that. I had leisure to entertain the retort in my
mind, while he slowly lifted his heavy glance from the pavement, up
my legs and arms, to my face.
“Then you have left the forge?” I said.
“Do this look like a forge?” replied Orlick, sending his glance all
round him with an air of injury. “Now, do it look like it?”
I asked him how long he had left Gargery’s forge?
“One day is so like another here,” he replied, “that I don’t know
without casting it up. However, I come here some time since you
left.”
“I could have told you that, Orlick.”
“Ah!” said he, dryly. “But then you’ve got to be a scholar.”
By this time we had come to the house, where I found his room to
be one just within the side door, with a little window in it looking on
the court-yard. In its small proportions, it was not unlike the kind of
place usually assigned to a gate-porter in Paris. Certain keys were
hanging on the wall, to which he now added the gate key; and his
patchwork-covered bed was in a little inner division or recess. The
whole had a slovenly confined and sleepy look, like a cage for a
human dormouse: while he, looming dark and heavy in the shadow
of a corner by the window, looked like the human dormouse for
whom it was fitted up––as indeed he was.
“I never saw this room before,” I remarked; “but there used to be
no Porter here.”
“No,” said he; “not till it got about that there was no protection on
the premises, and it come to be considered dangerous, with convicts
and Tag and Rag and Bobtail* going up and down. And then I was
recommended to the place as a man who could give another man as
good as he brought, and I took it. It’s easier than bellowsing and
hammering.––That’s loaded, that is.”
My eye had been caught by a gun with a brass-bound stock over
the chimney-piece, and his eye had followed mine.
“Well,” said I, not desirous of more conversation, “shall I go up to
Miss Havisham?”
xxix] Volume II Chapter X 213
“Burn me, if I know!” he retorted, first stretching himself and
then shaking himself; “my orders ends here, young master. I give this
here bell a rap with this here hammer, and you go along the passage
till you meet somebody.”
“I am expected, I believe?”
“Burn me twice over, if I can say!” said he.
Upon that, I turned down the long passage which I had first
trodden in my thick boots, and he made his bell sound. At the end of
the passage, while the bell was still reverberating, I found Sarah
Pocket: who appeared to have now become constitutionally green
and yellow by reason of me.
“Oh!” said she. “You, is it, Mr. Pip?”
“It is, Miss Pocket. I am glad to tell you that Mr. Pocket and
family are all well.”
“Are they any wiser?” said Sarah, with a dismal shake of the head;
“they had better be wiser, than well. Ah, Matthew, Matthew! You
know your way, sir?”
Tolerably, for I had gone up the staircase in the dark, many a time.
I ascended it now, in lighter boots than of yore, and tapped in my old
way at the door of Miss Havisham’s room. “Pip’s rap,” I heard her
say, immediately; “come in, Pip.”
She was in her chair near the old table, in the old dress, with her
two hands crossed on her stick, her chin resting on them, and her
eyes on the fire. Sitting near her, with the white shoe that had never
been worn, in her hand, and her head bent as she looked at it, was an
elegant lady whom I had never seen.
“Come in, Pip,” Miss Havisham continued to mutter, without
looking round or up; “come in, Pip, how do you do, Pip? so you kiss
my hand as if I were a queen, eh?––––Well?”
She looked up at me suddenly, only moving her eyes, and repeated
in a grimly playful manner,
“Well?”
“I heard, Miss Havisham,” said I, rather at a loss, “that you were
so kind as to wish me to come and see you, and I came directly.”
“Well?”
The lady whom I had never seen before, lifted up her eyes and
looked archly at me, and then I saw that the eyes were Estella’s eyes.
But she was so much changed, was so much more beautiful, so much
more womanly, in all things winning admiration had made such
214 Great Expectations
wonderful advance, that I seemed to have made none. I fancied, as I
looked at her, that I slipped hopelessly back into the coarse and
common boy again. O the sense of distance and disparity that came
upon me, and the inaccessibility that came about her!
She gave me her hand. I stammered something about the pleasure
I felt in seeing her again, and about my having looked forward to it
for a long, long time.
“Do you find her much changed, Pip?” asked Miss Havisham,
with her greedy look, and striking her stick upon a chair that stood
between them, as a sign to me to sit down there.
“When I came in, Miss Havisham, I thought there was nothing of
Estella in the face or figure; but now it all settles down so curiously
into the old––––”
“What? You are not going to say into the old Estella?” Miss Havisham interrupted. “She was proud and insulting, and you wanted to
go away from her. Don’t you remember?”
I said confusedly that that was long ago, and that I knew no better
then, and the like. Estella smiled with perfect composure, and said
she had no doubt of my having been quite right, and of her having
been very disagreeable.
“Is he changed?” Miss Havisham asked her.
“Very much,” said Estella, looking at me.
“Less coarse and common?” said Miss Havisham, playing with
Estella’s hair.
Estella laughed, and looked at the shoe in her hand, and laughed
again, and looked at me, and put the shoe down. She treated me as a
boy still, but she lured me on.
We sat in the dreamy room among the old strange influences
which had so wrought upon me, and I learnt that she had but just
come home from France, and that she was going to London. Proud
and wilful as of old, she had brought those qualities into such subjection to her beauty that it was impossible and out of nature––or I
thought so––to separate them from her beauty. Truly it was impossible to dissociate her presence from all those wretched hankerings
after money and gentility that had disturbed my boyhood––from all
those ill-regulated aspirations that had first made me ashamed of
home and Joe––from all those visions that had raised her face in the
glowing fire, struck it out of the iron on the anvil, extracted it from
the darkness of night to look in at the wooden window of the forge
xxix] Volume II Chapter X 215
and flit away. In a word, it was impossible for me to separate her, in
the past or in the present, from the innermost life of my life.
It was settled that I should stay there all the rest of the day, and
return to the hotel at night, and to London to-morrow. When we had
conversed for a while, Miss Havisham sent us two out to walk in the
neglected garden: on our coming in by-and-by, she said, I should
wheel her about a little as in times of yore.
So, Estella and I went out into the garden by the gate through
which I had strayed to my encounter with the pale young gentleman,
now Herbert; I, trembling in spirit and worshipping the very hem of
her dress; she, quite composed and most decidedly not worshipping
the hem of mine. As we drew near to the place of encounter, she
stopped and said:
“I must have been a singular little creature to hide and see that
fight that day: but I did, and I enjoyed it very much.”
“You rewarded me very much.”
“Did I?” she replied, in an incidental and forgetful way. “I
remember I entertained a great objection to your adversary, because I
took it ill that he should be brought here to pester me with his
company.”
“He and I are great friends now,” said I.
“Are you? I think I recollect though, that you read with his
father?”
“Yes.”
I made the admission with reluctance, for it seemed to have a
boyish look, and she already treated me more than enough like a boy.
“Since your change of fortune and prospects, you have changed
your companions,” said Estella.
“Naturally,” said I.
“And necessarily,” she added, in a haughty tone; “what was fit
company for you once, would be quite unfit company for you now.”
In my conscience, I doubt very much whether I had any lingering
intention left, of going to see Joe; but if I had, this observation put it
to flight.
“You had no idea of your impending good fortune, in those
times?” said Estella, with a slight wave of her hand, signifying in the
fighting times.
“Not the least.”
The air of completeness and superiority with which she walked at
216 Great Expectations
my side, and the air of youthfulness and submission with which I
walked at hers, made a contrast that I strongly felt. It would have
rankled in me more than it did, if I had not regarded myself as
eliciting it by being so set apart for her and assigned to her.
The garden was too overgrown and rank for walking in with ease,
and after we had made the round of it twice or thrice, we came out
again into the brewery yard. I showed her to a nicety where I had
seen her walking on the casks, that first old day, and she said, with a
cold and careless look in that direction, “Did I?” I reminded her
where she had come out of the house and given me my meat and
drink, and she said, “I don’t remember.” “Not remember that you
made me cry?” said I. “No,” said she, and shook her head and looked
about her. I verily believe that her not remembering and not minding
in the least, made me cry again, inwardly––and that is the sharpest
crying of all.
“You must know,” said Estella, condescending to me as a brilliant
and beautiful woman might, “that I have no heart––if that has anything to do with my memory.”
I got through some jargon to the effect that I took the liberty of
doubting that. That I knew better. That there could be no such
beauty without it.
“Oh! I have a heart to be stabbed in or shot in, I have no doubt,”
said Estella, “and, of course, if it ceased to beat I should cease to be.
But you know what I mean. I have no softness there, no––
sympathy––sentiment––nonsense.”
What was it that was borne in upon my mind when she stood still
and looked attentively at me? Anything that I had seen in Miss
Havisham? No. In some of her looks and gestures there was that
tinge of resemblance to Miss Havisham which may often be noticed
to have been acquired by children, from grown persons with whom
they have been much associated and secluded, and which, when
childhood is past, will produce a remarkable occasional likeness of
expression between faces that are otherwise quite different. And yet
I could not trace this to Miss Havisham. I looked again, and though
she was still looking at me, the suggestion was gone.
What was it?
“I am serious,” said Estella, not so much with a frown (for her
brow was smooth) as with a darkening of her face; “if we are to be
thrown much together, you had better believe it at once. No!”
xxix] Volume II Chapter X 217
imperiously stopping me as I opened my lips. “I have not bestowed
my tenderness anywhere. I have never had any such thing.”
In another moment we were in the brewery so long disused, and
she pointed to the high gallery where I had seen her going out on
that same first day, and told me she remembered to have been up
there, and to have seen me standing scared below. As my eyes followed her white hand, again the same dim suggestion that I could
not possibly grasp, crossed me. My involuntary start occasioned her
to lay her hand upon my arm. Instantly the ghost passed once more,
and was gone.
What was it?
“What is the matter?” asked Estella. “Are you scared again?”
“I should be, if I believed what you said just now,” I replied, to
turn it off.
“Then you don’t? Very well. It is said, at any rate. Miss Havisham
will soon be expecting you at your old post, though I think that
might be laid aside now, with other old belongings. Let us make one
more round of the garden, and then go in. Come! You shall not shed
tears for my cruelty to-day; you shall be my Page,* and give me your
shoulder.”
Her handsome dress had trailed upon the ground. She held it in
one hand now, and with the other lightly touched my shoulder as we
walked. We walked round the ruined garden twice or thrice more,
and it was all in bloom for me. If the green and yellow growth of
weed in the chinks of the old wall had been the most precious flowers
that ever blew, it could not have been more cherished in my
remembrance.
There was no discrepancy of years between us, to remove her far
from me; we were of nearly the same age, though of course the age
told for more in her case than in mine; but the air of inaccessibility
which her beauty and her manner gave her, tormented me in the
midst of my delight, and at the height of the assurance I felt that our
patroness had chosen us for one another. Wretched boy!
At last we went back into the house, and there I heard, with
surprise, that my guardian had come down to see Miss Havisham on
business, and would come back to dinner. The old wintry branches
of chandeliers in the room where the mouldering table was spread,
had been lighted while we were out, and Miss Havisham was in her
chair and waiting for me.
218 Great Expectations
It was like pushing the chair itself back into the past, when we
began the old slow circuit round about the ashes of the bridal feast.
But, in the funereal room, with that figure of the grave fallen back in
the chair fixing its eyes upon her, Estella looked more bright and
beautiful than before, and I was under stronger enchantment.
The time so melted away, that our early dinner-hour drew close at
hand, and Estella left us to prepare herself. We had stopped near the
centre of the long table, and Miss Havisham, with one of her
withered arms stretched out of the chair, rested that clenched hand
upon the yellow cloth. As Estella looked back over her shoulder
before going out at the door, Miss Havisham kissed that hand to her,
with a ravenous intensity that was of its kind quite dreadful.
Then, Estella being gone and we two left alone, she turned to me,
and said in a whisper:
“Is she beautiful, graceful, well-grown? Do you admire her?”
“Everybody must who sees her, Miss Havisham.”
She drew an arm round my neck, and drew my head close down to
hers as she sat in the chair. “Love her, love her, love her! How does
she use you?”
Before I could answer (if I could have answered so difficult a
question at all), she repeated, “Love her, love her, love her! If she
favours you, love her. If she wounds you, love her. If she tears your
heart to pieces––and as it gets older and stronger, it will tear
deeper––love her, love her, love her!”
Never had I seen such passionate eagerness as was joined to her
utterance of these words. I could feel the muscles of the thin arm
round my neck, swell with the vehemence that possessed her.
“Hear me, Pip! I adopted her to be loved. I bred her and educated
her, to be loved. I developed her into what she is, that she might be
loved. Love her!”
She said the word often enough, and there could be no doubt that
she meant to say it; but if the often repeated word had been hate
instead of love––despair––revenge––dire death––it could not have
sounded from her lips more like a curse.
“I’ll tell you,” said she, in the same hurried passionate whisper,
“what real love is. It is blind devotion, unquestioning selfhumiliation, utter submission, trust and belief against yourself and
against the whole world, giving up your whole heart and soul to the
smiter––as I did!”
xxix] Volume II Chapter X 219
When she came to that, and to a wild cry that followed that, I
caught her round the waist. For she rose up in the chair, in her
shroud of a dress, and struck at the air as if she would as soon have
struck herself against the wall and fallen dead.
All this passed in a few seconds. As I drew her down into her chair,
I was conscious of a scent that I knew, and turning, saw my guardian
in the room.
He always carried (I have not yet mentioned it, I think) a pockethandkerchief of rich silk and of imposing proportions, which was of
great value to him in his profession. I have seen him so terrify a
client or a witness by ceremoniously unfolding this pockethandkerchief as if he were immediately going to blow his nose, and
then pausing, as if he knew he should not have time to do it before
such client or witness committed himself, that the self-committal has
followed directly, quite as a matter of course. When I saw him in the
room, he had this expressive pocket-handkerchief in both hands, and
was looking at us. On meeting my eye, he said plainly, by a momentary and silent pause in that attitude, “Indeed? Singular!” and then
put the handkerchief to its right use with wonderful effect.
Miss Havisham had seen him as soon as I, and was (like everybody
else) afraid of him. She made a strong attempt to compose herself,
and stammered that he was as punctual as ever.
“As punctual as ever,” he repeated, coming up to us. “(How do
you do, Pip. Shall I give you a ride, Miss Havisham? Once round?)
And so you are here, Pip?”
I told him when I had arrived, and how Miss Havisham had
wished me to come and see Estella. To which he replied, “Ah! Very
fine young lady!” Then he pushed Miss Havisham in her chair
before him, with one of his large hands, and put the other in his
trousers-pocket as if the pocket were full of secrets.
“Well, Pip! How often have you seen Miss Estella before?” said he,
when he came to a stop.
“How often?”
“Ah! How many times. Ten thousand times?”
“Oh! Certainly not so many.”
“Twice?”
“Jaggers,” interposed Miss Havisham, much to my relief; “leave
my Pip alone, and go with him to your dinner.”
He complied, and we groped our way down the dark stairs
220 Great Expectations
together. While we were still on our way to those detached apartments across the paved yard at the back, he asked me how often I had
seen Miss Havisham eat and drink; offering me a breadth of choice,
as usual, between a hundred times and once.
I considered, and said, “Never.”
“And never will, Pip,” he retorted, with a frowning smile. “She
has never allowed herself to be seen doing either, since she lived this
present life of hers. She wanders about in the night, and then lays
hands on such food as she takes.”
“Pray, sir,” said I, “may I ask you a question?”
“You may,” said he, “and I may decline to answer it. Put your
question.”
“Estella’s name. Is it Havisham, or––––?” I had nothing to add.
“Or what?” said he.
“Is it Havisham?”
“It is Havisham.”
This brought us to the dinner-table, where she and Sarah Pocket
awaited us. Mr Jaggers presided, Estella sat opposite to him, I faced
my green and yellow friend. We dined very well, and were waited on
by a maid servant whom I had never seen in all my comings and
goings, but who, for anything I know, had been in that mysterious
house the whole time. After dinner, a bottle of choice old port was
placed before my guardian (he was evidently well acquainted with
the vintage), and the two ladies left us.
Anything to equal the determined reticence of Mr. Jaggers under
that roof, I never saw elsewhere, even in him. He kept his very looks
to himself, and scarcely directed his eyes to Estella’s face once during
dinner. When she spoke to him, he listened, and in due course
answered, but never looked at her, that I could see. On the other
hand, she often looked at him, with interest and curiosity, if not
distrust, but his face never showed the least consciousness.
Throughout dinner he took a dry delight in making Sarah Pocket
greener and yellower, by often referring in conversation with me to
my expectations; but here, again, he showed no consciousness, and
even made it appear that he extorted––and even did extort, though I
don’t know how––those references out of my innocent self.
And when he and I were left alone together, he sat with an air
upon him of general lying by in consequence of information he
possessed, that really was too much for me. He cross-examined his
xxix] Volume II Chapter X 221
very wine when he had nothing else in hand. He held it between
himself and the candle, tasted the port, rolled it in his mouth, swallowed it, looked at his glass again, smelt the port, tried it, drank it,
filled again, and cross-examined the glass again, until I was as nervous as if I had known the wine to be telling him something to my
disadvantage. Three or four times I feebly thought I would start
conversation; but whenever he saw me going to ask him anything, he
looked at me with his glass in his hand, and rolling his wine about in
his mouth, as if requesting me to take notice that it was of no use, for
he couldn’t answer.
I think Miss Pocket was conscious that the sight of me involved
her in the danger of being goaded to madness, and perhaps tearing
off her cap––which was a very hideous one, in the nature of a muslin
mop––and strewing the ground with her hair––which assuredly had
never grown on her head. She did not appear when we afterwards
went up to Miss Havisham’s room, and we four played at whist. In
the interval, Miss Havisham, in a fantastic way, had put some of the
most beautiful jewels from her dressing-table into Estella’s hair, and
about her bosom and arms; and I saw even my guardian look at her
from under his thick eyebrows, and raise them a little, when her
loveliness was before him, with those rich flushes of glitter and
colour in it.
Of the manner and extent to which he took our trumps into custody, and came out with mean little cards at the ends of hands, before
which the glory of our Kings and Queens was utterly abased, I say
nothing; nor, of the feeling that I had, respecting his looking upon us
personally in the light of three very obvious and poor riddles that he
had found out long ago. What I suffered from, was the incompatibility between his cold presence and my feelings towards Estella. It was
not that I knew I could never bear to speak to him about her, that
I knew I could never bear to hear him creak his boots at her, that I
knew I could never bear to see him wash his hands of her; it was, that
my admiration should be within a foot or two of him––it was, that
my feelings should be in the same place with him––that, was the
agonising circumstance.
We played until nine o’clock, and then it was arranged that when
Estella came to London I should be forewarned of her coming and
should meet her at the coach; and then I took leave of her, and
touched her and left her.
222 Great Expectations
My guardian lay at the Boar in the next room to mine. Far into the
night, Miss Havisham’s words, “Love her, love her, love her!”
sounded in my ears. I adapted them for my own repetition, and said
to my pillow, “I love her, I love her, I love her!” hundreds of times.
Then, a burst of gratitude came upon me, that she should be destined for me, once the blacksmith’s boy. Then, I thought if she were,
as I feared, by no means rapturously grateful for that destiny yet,
when would she begin to be interested in me? When should I awaken
the heart within her, that was mute and sleeping now?
Ah me! I thought those were high and great emotions. But I never
thought there was anything low and small in my keeping away from
Joe, because I knew she would be contemptuous of him. It was but a
day gone, and Joe had brought the tears into my eyes; they had soon
dried, God forgive me! soon dried.
CHAPTER XI
After well considering the matter while I was dressing at the Blue
Boar in the morning, I resolved to tell my guardian that I doubted
Orlick’s being the right sort of man to fill a post of trust at Miss
Havisham’s. “Why, of course he is not the right sort of man, Pip,”
said my guardian, comfortably satisfied beforehand on the general
head, “because the man who fills the post of trust never is the right
sort of man.” It seemed quite to put him into spirits, to find that this
particular post was not exceptionally held by the right sort of man,
and he listened in a satisfied manner while I told him what knowledge I had of Orlick. “Very good, Pip,” he observed, when I had
concluded, “I’ll go round presently, and pay our friend off.” Rather
alarmed by this summary action, I was for a little delay, and even
hinted that our friend himself might be difficult to deal with. “Oh no
he won’t,” said my guardian, making his pocket-handkerchief-point,
with perfect confidence; “I should like to see him argue the question
with me.”
As we were going back together to London by the mid-day coach,
and as I breakfasted under such terrors of Pumblechook that I could
scarcely hold my cup, this gave me an opportunity of saying that I
wanted a walk, and that I would go on along the London-road while
Mr. Jaggers was occupied, if he would let the coachman know that I
xxx] Volume II Chapter XI 223
would get into my place when overtaken. I was thus enabled to fly
from the Blue Boar immediately after breakfast. By then making a
loop of about a couple of miles into the open country at the back of
Pumblechook’s premises, I got round into the High-street again, a
little beyond that pitfall, and felt myself in comparative security.
It was interesting to be in the quiet old town once more, and it was
not disagreeable to be here and there suddenly recognised and stared
after. One or two of the tradespeople even darted out of their shops
and went a little way down the street before me, that they might
turn, as if they had forgotten something, and pass me face to face––
on which occasions I don’t know whether they or I made the worse
pretence; they of not doing it, or I of not seeing it. Still my position
was a distinguished one, and I was not at all dissatisfied with it, until
Fate threw me in the way of that unlimited miscreant, Trabb’s boy.
Casting my eyes along the street at a certain point of my progress,
I beheld Trabb’s boy approaching, lashing himself with an empty
blue bag. Deeming that a serene and unconscious contemplation of
him would best beseem me, and would be most likely to quell his evil
mind, I advanced with that expression of countenance, and was
rather congratulating myself on my success, when suddenly the
knees of Trabb’s boy smote together, his hair uprose, his cap fell off,
he trembled violently in every limb, staggered out into the road, and
crying to the populace, “Hold me! I’m so frightened!” feigned to be
in a paroxysm of terror and contrition, occasioned by the dignity of
my appearance. As I passed him, his teeth loudly chattered in his
head, and with every mark of extreme humiliation, he prostrated
himself in the dust.
This was a hard thing to bear, but this was nothing. I had not advanced another two hundred yards, when, to my inexpressible terror,
amazement, and indignation, I again beheld Trabb’s boy approaching. He was coming round a narrow corner. His blue bag was slung
over his shoulder, honest industry beamed in his eyes, a determination to proceed to Trabb’s with cheerful briskness was indicated in
his gait. With a shock he became aware of me, and was severely visited
as before; but this time his motion was rotatory, and he staggered
round and round me with knees more afflicted, and with uplifted
hands as if beseeching for mercy. His sufferings were hailed with the
greatest joy by a knot of spectators, and I felt utterly confounded.
I had not got as much further down the street as the post-office,
224 Great Expectations
when I again beheld Trabb’s boy shooting round by a back way. This
time, he was entirely changed. He wore the blue bag in the manner
of my great-coat, and was strutting along the pavement towards me
on the opposite side of the street, attended by a company of
delighted young friends to whom he from time to time exclaimed,
with a wave of his hand, “Don’t know yah!” Words cannot state the
amount of aggravation and injury wreaked upon me by Trabb’s boy,
when, passing abreast of me, he pulled up his shirt-collar, twined his
side-hair, stuck an arm akimbo, and smirked extravagantly by, wriggling his elbows and body, and drawling to his attendants, “Don’t
know yah, don’t know yah, pon my soul don’t know yah!” The
disgrace attendant on his immediately afterwards taking to crowing
and pursuing me across the bridge with crows, as from an exceedingly dejected fowl who had known me when I was a blacksmith,
culminated the disgrace with which I left the town, and was, so to
speak, ejected by it into the open country.
But unless I had taken the life of Trabb’s boy on that occasion, I
really do not even now see what I could have done save endure. To
have struggled with him in the street, or to have exacted any lower
recompense from him than his heart’s best blood, would have been
futile and degrading. Moreover, he was a boy whom no man could
hurt; an invulnerable and dodging serpent who, when chased into a
corner, flew out again between his captor’s legs, scornfully yelping. I
wrote, however, to Mr. Trabb by next day’s post, to say that Mr. Pip
must decline to deal further with one who could so far forget what he
owed to the best interests of society, as to employ a boy who excited
Loathing in every respectable mind.
The coach, with Mr. Jaggers inside, came up in due time, and I
took my box-seat again, and arrived in London safe––but not sound,
for my heart was gone. As soon as I arrived, I sent a penitential
codfish and barrel of oysters to Joe (as reparation for not having gone
myself), and then went on to Barnard’s Inn.
I found Herbert dining on cold meat, and delighted to welcome
me back. Having despatched the Avenger to the coffee-house for an
addition to the dinner, I felt that I must open my breast that very
evening to my friend and chum. As confidence was out of the question with the Avenger in the hall, which could merely be regarded in
the light of an ante-chamber to the keyhole, I sent him to the Play. A
better proof of the severity of my bondage to that taskmaster could
xxx] Volume II Chapter XI 225
scarcely be afforded, than the degrading shifts to which I was constantly driven to find him employment. So mean is extremity, that I
sometimes sent him to Hyde Park-corner* to see what o’clock it was.
Dinner done and we sitting with our feet upon the fender, I said to
Herbert, “My dear Herbert, I have something very particular to tell
you.”
“My dear Handel,” he returned, “I shall esteem and respect your
confidence.”
“It concerns myself, Herbert,” said I, “and one other person.”
Herbert crossed his feet, looked at the fire with his head on one
side, and having looked at it in vain for some time, looked at me
because I didn’t go on.
“Herbert,” said I, laying my hand upon his knee. “I love––I
adore––Estella.”
Instead of being transfixed, Herbert replied in an easy matter-ofcourse way, “Exactly. Well?”
“Well, Herbert? Is that all you say? Well?”
“What next, I mean?” said Herbert. “Of course I know that.”
“How do you know it?” said I.
“How do I know it, Handel? Why, from you.”
“I never told you.”
“Told me! You have never told me when you have got your hair
cut, but I have had senses to perceive it. You have always adored her,
ever since I have known you. You brought your adoration and your
portmanteau here, together. Told me! Why, you have always told me
all day long. When you told me your own story, you told me plainly
that you began adoring her the first time you saw her, when you were
very young indeed.”
“Very well, then,” said I, to whom this was a new and not
unwelcome light, “I have never left off adoring her. And she has
come back, a most beautiful and most elegant creature. And I saw
her yesterday. And if I adored her before, I now doubly adore her.”
“Lucky for you then, Handel,” said Herbert, “that you are picked
out for her and allotted to her. Without encroaching on forbidden
ground, we may venture to say that there can be no doubts between
ourselves of that fact. Have you any idea yet, of Estella’s views on the
adoration question?”
I shook my head gloomily. “Oh! She is thousands of miles away,
from me,” said I.
226 Great Expectations
“Patience, my dear Handel: time enough, time enough. But you
have something more to say?”
“I am ashamed to say it,” I returned, “and yet it’s no worse to say
it than to think it. You call me a lucky fellow. Of course, I am. I was a
blacksmith’s boy but yesterday; I am––what shall I say I am––today?”
“Say, a good fellow, if you want a phrase,” returned Herbert,
smiling, and clapping his hand on the back of mine, “a good fellow,
with impetuosity and hesitation, boldness and diffidence, action and
dreaming, curiously mixed in him.”
I stopped for a moment to consider whether there really was this
mixture in my character. On the whole, I by no means recognised the
analysis, but thought it not worth disputing.
“When I ask what I am to call myself to-day, Herbert,” I went on,
“I suggest what I have in my thoughts. You say I am lucky. I know I
have done nothing to raise myself in life, and that Fortune alone has
raised me; that is being very lucky. And yet, when I think of
Estella––––”
(“And when don’t you, you know?” Herbert threw in, with his
eyes on the fire; which I thought kind and sympathetic of him.)
“––Then, my dear Herbert, I cannot tell you how dependent and
uncertain I feel, and how exposed to hundreds of chances. Avoiding
forbidden ground, as you did just now, I may still say that on the
constancy of one person (naming no person) all my expectations
depend. And at the best, how indefinite and unsatisfactory, only to
know so vaguely what they are!” In saying this, I relieved my mind of
what had always been there, more or less, though no doubt most
since yesterday.
“Now, Handel,” Herbert replied, in his gay hopeful way, “it seems
to me that in the despondency of the tender passion, we are looking
into our gift-horse’s mouth with a magnifying glass. Likewise, it
seems to me that, concentrating our attention on the examination,
we altogether overlook one of the best points of the animal. Didn’t
you tell me that your guardian, Mr. Jaggers, told you in the beginning, that you were not endowed with expectations only? And even
if he had not told you so––though that is a very large If, I grant––
could you believe that of all men in London, Mr. Jaggers is the man
to hold his present relations towards you unless he were sure of his
ground?”
xxx] Volume II Chapter XI 227
I said I could not deny that this was a strong point. I said it (people
often do so, in such cases) like a rather reluctant concession to truth
and justice;––as if I wanted to deny it!
“I should think it was a strong point,” said Herbert, “and I should
think you would be puzzled to imagine a stronger; as to the rest, you
must bide your guardian’s time, and he must bide his client’s time.
You’ll be one-and-twenty before you know where you are, and then
perhaps you’ll get some further enlightenment. At all events, you’ll
be nearer getting it, for it must come at last.”
“What a hopeful disposition you have!” said I, gratefully admiring
his cheery ways.
“I ought to have,” said Herbert, “for I have not much else. I must
acknowledge, by-the-by, that the good sense of what I have just said
is not my own, but my father’s. The only remark I ever heard him
make on your story, was the final one: ‘The thing is settled and done,
or Mr. Jaggers would not be in it.’ And now before I say anything
more about my father, or my father’s son, and repay confidence with
confidence, I want to make myself seriously disagreeable to you for a
moment––positively repulsive.”
“You won’t succeed,” said I.
“Oh yes I shall!” said he. “One, two, three, and now I am in for it.
Handel, my good fellow;” though he spoke in this light tone, he was
very much in earnest; “I have been thinking since we have been
talking with our feet on this fender, that Estella surely cannot be a
condition of your inheritance, if she was never referred to by your
guardian. Am I right in so understanding what you have told me, as
that he never referred to her, directly or indirectly, in any way? Never
even hinted, for instance, that your patron might have views as to
your marriage ultimately?”
“Never.”
“Now, Handel, I am quite free from the flavour of sour grapes,
upon my soul and honour! Not being bound to her, can you not
detach yourself from her?––I told you I should be disagreeable.”
I turned my head aside, for, with a rush and a sweep, like the old
marsh winds coming up from the sea, a feeling like that which had
subdued me on the morning when I left the forge, when the mists
were solemnly rising, and when I laid my hand upon the village
finger-post, smote upon my heart again. There was silence between
us for a little while.
228 Great Expectations
“Yes; but my dear Handel,” Herbert went on, as if we had been
talking instead of silent, “its having been so strongly rooted in the
breast of a boy whom nature and circumstances made so romantic,
renders it very serious. Think of her bringing-up, and think of Miss
Havisham. Think of what she is herself (now I am repulsive and you
abominate me). This may lead to miserable things.”
“I know it, Herbert,” said I, with my head still turned away, “but I
can’t help it.”
“You can’t detach yourself?”
“No. Impossible!”
“You can’t try, Handel?”
“No. Impossible!”
“Well!” said Herbert, getting up with a lively shake as if he had
been asleep, and stirring the fire; “now I’ll endeavour to make myself
agreeable again!”
So he went round the room and shook the curtains out, put the
chairs in their places, tidied the books and so forth that were lying
about, looked into the hall, peeped into the letter-box, shut the door,
and came back to his chair by the fire: where he sat down, nursing his
left leg in both arms.
“I was going to say a word or two, Handel, concerning my father
and my father’s son. I am afraid it is scarcely necessary for my
father’s son to remark that my father’s establishment is not particularly brilliant in its housekeeping.”
“There is always plenty, Herbert,” said I: to say something
encouraging.
“Oh yes! and so the dustman says, I believe, with the strongest
approval, and so does the marine store-shop in the back street.
Gravely, Handel, for the subject is grave enough, you know how it is,
as well as I do. I suppose there was a time once when my father had
not given matters up; but if ever there was, the time is gone. May I
ask you if you have ever had an opportunity of remarking, down in
your part of the country, that the children of not exactly suitable
marriages, are always most particularly anxious to be married?”*
This was such a singular question, that I asked him in return, “Is
it so?”
“I don’t know,” said Herbert, “that’s what I want to know.
Because it is decidedly the case with us. My poor sister Charlotte
who was next me and died before she was fourteen, was a striking
xxx] Volume II Chapter XI 229
example. Little Jane is the same. In her desire to be matrimonially
established, you might suppose her to have passed her short existence in the perpetual contemplation of domestic bliss. Little Alick in
a frock has already made arrangements for his union with a suitable
young person at Kew. And indeed, I think we are all engaged, except
the baby.”
“Then you are?” said I.
“I am,” said Herbert; “but it’s a secret.”
I assured him of my keeping the secret, and begged to be favoured
with further particulars. He had spoken so sensibly and feelingly of
my weakness that I wanted to know something about his strength.
“May I ask the name?” I said.
“Name of Clara,” said Herbert.
“Live in London?”
“Yes. Perhaps I ought to mention,” said Herbert, who had become
curiously crestfallen and meek, since we entered on the interesting
theme, “that she is rather below my mother’s nonsensical family
notions. Her father had to do with the victualling of passenger-ships.
I think he was a species of purser.”
“What is he now?” said I.
“He’s an invalid now,” replied Herbert.
“Living on––––?”
“On the first floor,” said Herbert. Which was not at all what I
meant, for I had intended my question to apply to his means. “I have
never seen him, for he has always kept his room overhead, since I
have known Clara. But I have heard him constantly. He makes tremendous rows––roars, and pegs at the floor with some frightful
instrument.” In looking at me and then laughing heartily, Herbert
for the time recovered his usual lively manner.
“Don’t you expect to see him?” said I.
“Oh yes, I constantly expect to see him,” returned Herbert,
“because I never hear him, without expecting him to come tumbling
through the ceiling. But I don’t know how long the rafters may
hold.”
When he had once more laughed heartily, he became meek again,
and told me that the moment he began to realise Capital, it was his
intention to marry this young lady. He added as a self-evident proposition, engendering low spirits, “But you can’t marry, you know,
while you’re looking about you.”
230 Great Expectations
As we contemplated the fire, and as I thought what a difficult
vision to realise this same Capital sometimes was, I put my hands in
my pockets. A folded piece of paper in one of them attracting my
attention, I opened it and found it to be the play-bill I had received
from Joe, relative to the celebrated provincial amateur of Roscian
renown. “And bless my heart,” I involuntarily added aloud, “it’s
to-night!”
This changed the subject in an instant, and made us hurriedly
resolve to go to the play. So, when I had pledged myself to comfort
and abet Herbert in the affair of his heart by all practicable and
impracticable means, and when Herbert had told me that his affianced already knew me by reputation and that I should be presented
to her, and when we had warmly shaken hands upon our mutual
confidence, we blew out our candles, made up our fire, locked our
door, and issued forth in quest of Mr. Wopsle and Denmark.
CHAPTER XII
On our arrival in Denmark,* we found the king and queen of that
country elevated in two arm-chairs on a kitchen-table, holding a
Court. The whole of the Danish nobility were in attendance; consisting of a noble boy in the wash-leather boots* of a gigantic ancestor,
a venerable Peer with a dirty face who seemed to have risen from the
people late in life, and the Danish chivalry with a comb in its hair
and a pair of white silk legs, and presenting on the whole a feminine
appearance. My gifted townsman stood gloomily apart, with folded
arms, and I could have wished that his curls and forehead had been
more probable.
Several curious little circumstances transpired as the action proceeded. The late king of the country not only appeared to have been
troubled with a cough at the time of his decease, but to have taken it
with him to the tomb, and to have brought it back. The royal
phantom also carried a ghostly manuscript round its truncheon, to
which it had the appearance of occasionally referring, and that, too,
with an air of anxiety and a tendency to lose the place of reference
which were suggestive of a state of mortality. It was this, I conceive,
which led to the Shade’s being advised by the gallery to “turn
over!”––a recommendation which it took extremely ill. It was
xxxi] Volume II Chapter XII 231
likewise to be noted of this majestic spirit that whereas it always
appeared with an air of having been out a long time and walked an
immense distance, it perceptibly came from a closely contiguous
wall. This occasioned its terrors to be received derisively. The Queen
of Denmark, a very buxom lady, though no doubt historically brazen, was considered by the public to have too much brass about her;
her chin being attached to her diadem by a broad band of that metal
(as if she had a gorgeous toothache), her waist being encircled by
another, and each of her arms by another, so that she was openly
mentioned as “the kettle-drum.” The noble boy in the ancestral
boots, was inconsistent; representing himself, as it were in one breath,
as an able seaman, a strolling actor, a gravedigger, a clergyman, and a
person of the utmost importance at a Court fencing-match,* on the
authority of whose practised eye and nice discrimination the finest
strokes were judged. This gradually led to a want of toleration for
him, and even––on his being detected in holy orders, and declining
to perform the funeral service––to the general indignation taking
the form of nuts. Lastly, Ophelia was a prey to such slow musical
madness, that when, in course of time, she had taken off her white
muslin scarf, folded it up, and buried it, a sulky man who had been
long cooling his impatient nose against an iron bar in the front row
of the gallery, growled, “Now the baby’s put to bed let’s have
supper!” Which, to say the least of it, was out of keeping.
Upon my unfortunate townsman all these incidents accumulated
with playful effect. Whenever that undecided Prince had to ask a
question or state a doubt, the public helped him out with it. As for
example; on the question whether ’twas nobler in the mind to suffer,
some roared yes, and some no, and some inclining to both opinions
said “toss up for it;” and quite a Debating Society arose. When he
asked what should such fellows as he do crawling between earth and
heaven, he was encouraged with loud cries of “Hear, hear!” When he
appeared with his stocking disordered (its disorder expressed,
according to usage, by one very neat fold in the top, which I suppose
to be always got up with a flat iron), a conversation took place in the
gallery respecting the paleness of his leg, and whether it was occasioned by the turn the ghost had given him. On his taking the
recorders––very like a little black flute that had just been played in
the orchestra and handed out at the door––he was called upon
unanimously for Rule Britannia. When he recommended the player
232 Great Expectations
not to saw the air thus, the sulky man said, “And don’t you do it,
neither; you’re a deal worse than him!” And I grieve to add that peals
of laughter greeted Mr. Wopsle on every one of these occasions.
But his greatest trials were in the churchyard: which had the
appearance of a primeval forest, with a kind of small ecclesiastical
wash-house on one side, and a turnpike-gate on the other. Mr.
Wopsle in a comprehensive black cloak, being descried entering at
the turnpike, the gravedigger was admonished in a friendly way,
“Look out! Here’s the undertaker a coming, to see how you’re a
getting on with your work!” I believe it is well known in a constitutional country that Mr. Wopsle could not possibly have returned
the skull, after moralising over it, without dusting his fingers on a
white napkin taken from his breast;* but even that innocent and
indispensable action did not pass without the comment “Wai-ter!”
The arrival of the body for interment (in an empty black box with
the lid tumbling open), was the signal for a general joy which was
much enhanced by the discovery, among the bearers, of an individual
obnoxious to identification. The joy attended Mr. Wopsle through
his struggle with Laertes on the brink of the orchestra and the grave,
and slackened no more until he had tumbled the king off the
kitchen-table, and had died by inches from the ankles upward.
We had made some pale efforts in the beginning to applaud Mr.
Wopsle; but they were too hopeless to be persisted in. Therefore we
had sat, feeling keenly for him, but laughing, nevertheless, from ear
to ear. I laughed in spite of myself all the time, the whole thing was
so droll; and yet I had a latent impression that there was something
decidedly fine in Mr. Wopsle’s elocution––not for old associations’
sake, I am afraid, but because it was very slow, very dreary, very uphill and down-hill, and very unlike any way in which any man in any
natural circumstances of life or death ever expressed himself about
anything. When the tragedy was over, and he had been called for and
hooted, I said to Herbert, “Let us go at once, or perhaps we shall
meet him.”
We made all the haste we could down stairs, but we were not quick
enough either. Standing at the door was a Jewish man with an
unnaturally heavy smear of eyebrow, who caught my eye as we
advanced, and said, when we came up with him:
“Mr. Pip and friend?”
Identity of Mr. Pip and friend confessed.
xxxi] Volume II Chapter XII 233
“Mr. Waldengarver,” said the man, “would be glad to have the
honour.”
“Waldengarver?” I repeated––when Herbert murmured in my
ear, “Probably Wopsle.”*
“Oh!” said I. “Yes. Shall we follow you?”
“A few steps, please.” When we were in a side alley, he turned and
asked, “How did you think he looked?––I dressed him.”
I don’t know what he had looked like, except a funeral; with the
addition of a large Danish sun or star hanging round his neck by a
blue ribbon, that had given him the appearance of being insured in
some extraordinary Fire Office.* But I said he had looked very nice.
“When he come to the grave,” said our conductor, “he showed his
cloak beautiful. But, judging from the wing, it looked to me that
when he see the ghost in the queen’s apartment, he might have made
more of his stockings.”
I modestly assented, and we all fell through a little dirty swing
door, into a sort of hot packing-case immediately behind it. Here Mr.
Wopsle was divesting himself of his Danish garments, and here there
was just room for us to look at him over one another’s shoulders, by
keeping the packing-case door, or lid, wide open.
“Gentlemen,” said Mr. Wopsle, “I am proud to see you. I hope,
Mr. Pip, you will excuse my sending round. I had the happiness to
know you in former times, and the Drama has ever had a claim
which has ever been acknowledged, on the noble and the affluent.”
Meanwhile, Mr. Waldengarver, in a frightful perspiration, was
trying to get himself out of his princely sables.
“Skin the stockings off, Mr. Waldengarver,” said the owner of that
property, “or you’ll bust ’em. Bust ’em, and you’ll bust five-andthirty shillings. Shakspeare never was complimented with a finer
pair. Keep quiet in your chair now, and leave ’em to me.”
With that, he went upon his knees, and began to flay his victim;
who, on the first stocking coming off, would certainly have fallen
over backward with his chair, but for there being no room to fall
anyhow.
I had been afraid until then to say a word about the play. But then,
Mr. Waldengarver looked up at us complacently, and said:
“Gentlemen, how did it seem to you, to go, in front?”
Herbert said from behind (at the same time poking me), “capitally.” So I said “capitally.”
234 Great Expectations
“How did you like my reading of the character, gentlemen?” said
Mr. Waldengarver, almost, if not quite, with patronage.
Herbert said from behind (again poking me), “massive and concrete.” So I said boldly, as if I had originated it, and must beg to
insist upon it, “massive and concrete.”
“I am glad to have your approbation, gentlemen,” said Mr. Waldengarver, with an air of dignity, in spite of his being ground against
the wall at the time, and holding on by the seat of the chair.
“But I’ll tell you one thing, Mr. Waldengarver,” said the man who
was on his knees, “in which you’re out in your reading. Now mind! I
don’t care who says contrairy; I tell you so. You’re out in your reading of Hamlet when you get your legs in profile. The last Hamlet as I
dressed, made the same mistakes in his reading at rehearsal, till I got
him to put a large red wafer* on each of his shins, and then at that
rehearsal (which was the last) I went in front, sir, to the back of the
pit, and whenever his reading brought him into profile, I called out ‘I
don’t see no wafers!’ And at night his reading was lovely.”
Mr. Waldengarver smiled at me, as much as to say “a faithful
dependent––I overlook his folly;” and then said aloud, “My view is a
little classic and thoughtful for them here; but they will improve,
they will improve.”
Herbert and I said together, Oh no doubt they would improve.
“Did you observe gentlemen,” said Mr. Waldengarver, “that there
was a man in the gallery who endeavoured to cast derision on the
service––I mean, the representation?”
We basely replied that we rather thought we had noticed such a
man. I added, “He was drunk, no doubt.”
“Oh dear no, sir,” said Mr. Wopsle, “not drunk. His employer
would see to that, sir. His employer would not allow him to be
drunk.”
“You know his employer?” said I.
Mr. Wopsle shut his eyes, and opened them again; performing
both ceremonies very slowly. “You must have observed, gentlemen,”
said he, “an ignorant and a blatant ass, with a rasping throat and a
countenance expressive of low malignity, who went through––I will
not say sustained––the rôle (if I may use a French expression) of
Claudius King of Denmark. That is his employer, gentlemen. Such
is the profession!”
Without distinctly knowing whether I should have been more
xxxi] Volume II Chapter XII 235
sorry for Mr. Wopsle if he had been in despair, I was so sorry for
him as it was, that I took the opportunity of his turning round to
have his braces put on––which jostled us out at the doorway––to
ask Herbert what he thought of having him home to supper?
Herbert said he thought it would be kind to do so; therefore I invited
him, and he went to Barnard’s with us, wrapped up to the eyes, and
we did our best for him, and he sat until two o’clock in the morning,
reviewing his success and developing his plans. I forget in detail
what they were, but I have a general recollection that he was to
begin with reviving the Drama, and to end with crushing it;
inasmuch as his decease would leave it utterly bereft and without a
chance or hope.
Miserably I went to bed after all, and miserably thought of Estella,
and miserably dreamed that my expectations were all cancelled, and
that I had to give my hand in marriage to Herbert’s Clara, or play
Hamlet to Miss Havisham’s Ghost, before twenty thousand people,
without knowing twenty words of it.
CHAPTER XIII
One day when I was busy with my books and Mr. Pocket, I received
a note by the post, the mere outside of which threw me into a great
flutter; for, though I had never seen the handwriting in which it was
addressed, I divined whose hand it was. It had no set beginning, as
Dear Mr. Pip, or Dear Pip, or Dear Sir, or Dear Anything, but ran
thus:
“I am to come to London the day after to-morrow by the mid-day coach. I
believe it was settled you should meet me? At all events Miss Havisham
has that impression, and I write in obedience to it. She sends you her
regard.
“Yours, Estella.”
If there had been time, I should probably have ordered several
suits of clothes for this occasion; but as there was not, I was fain to be
content with those I had. My appetite vanished instantly, and I knew
no peace or rest until the day arrived. Not that its arrival brought me
either; for, then I was worse than ever, and began haunting the
coach-office in Wood-street, Cheapside, before the coach had left
236 Great Expectations
the Blue Boar in our town. For all that I knew this perfectly well, I
still felt as if it were not safe to let the coach-office be out of my sight
longer than five minutes at a time; and in this condition of unreason
I had performed the first half-hour of a watch of four or five hours,
when Wemmick ran against me.
“Halloa, Mr. Pip,” said he; “how do you do? I should hardly have
thought this was your beat.”
I explained that I was waiting to meet somebody who was coming
up by coach, and I inquired after the Castle and the Aged.
“Both flourishing, thankye,” said Wemmick, “and particularly the
Aged. He’s in wonderful feather. He’ll be eighty-two next birthday. I
have a notion of firing eighty-two times, if the neighbourhood
shouldn’t complain, and that cannon of mine should prove equal to
the pressure. However, this is not London talk. Where do you think I
am going to?”
“To the office?” said I, for he was tending in that direction.
“Next thing to it,” returned Wemmick, “I am going to Newgate.
We are in a banker’s-parcel case* just at present, and I have been
down the road taking a squint at the scene of action, and thereupon
must have a word or two with our client.”
“Did your client commit the robbery?” I asked.
“Bless your soul and body, no,” answered Wemmick, very dryly.
“But he is accused of it. So might you or I be. Either of us might be
accused of it, you know.”
“Only neither of us is,” I remarked.
“Yah!” said Wemmick, touching me on the breast with his forefinger; “you’re a deep one, Mr. Pip! Would you like to have a look at
Newgate? Have you time to spare?”
I had so much time to spare, that the proposal came as a relief,
notwithstanding its irreconcilability with my latent desire to keep
my eye on the coach-office. Muttering that I would make the inquiry
whether I had time to walk with him, I went into the office, and
ascertained from the clerk with the nicest precision and much to
the trying of his temper, the earliest moment at which the coach
could be expected––which I knew beforehand, quite as well as he. I
then rejoined Mr. Wemmick, and affecting to consult my watch
and to be surprised by the information I had received, accepted his
offer.
We were at Newgate in a few minutes, and we passed through the
xxxii] Volume II Chapter XIII 237
lodge where some fetters were hanging up on the bare walls among
the prison rules, into the interior of the jail. At that time, jails were
much neglected, and the period of exaggerated reaction consequent
on all public wrong-doing––and which is always its heaviest and
longest punishment––was still far off. So, felons were not lodged and
fed better than soldiers (to say nothing of paupers), and seldom set
fire to their prisons with the excusable object of improving the flavour of their soup.* It was visiting time when Wemmick took me in;
and a potman was going his rounds with beer; and the prisoners,
behind bars in yards, were buying beer, and talking to friends; and a
frouzy, ugly, disorderly, depressing scene it was.
It struck me that Wemmick walked among the prisoners, much as
a gardener might walk among his plants. This was first put into my
head by his seeing a shoot that had come up in the night, and saying,
“What, Captain Tom? Are you there? Ah, indeed!” and also, “Is
that Black Bill behind the cistern? Why I didn’t look for you these
two months; how do you find yourself?” Equally in his stopping at
the bars and attending to anxious whisperers––always singly––
Wemmick with his post-office in an immovable state, looked at them
while in conference, as if he were taking particular notice of the
advance they had made, since last observed, towards coming out in
full blow at their trial.
He was highly popular, and I found that he took the familiar
department of Mr. Jaggers’s business: though something of the state
of Mr. Jaggers hung about him too, forbidding approach beyond
certain limits. His personal recognition of each successive client was
comprised in a nod, and in his settling his hat a little easier on his
head with both hands, and then tightening the post-office, and putting his hands in his pockets. In one or two instances, there was a
difficulty respecting the raising of fees, and then Mr. Wemmick,
backing as far as possible from the insufficient money produced,
said, “It’s no use, my boy. I’m only a subordinate. I can’t take it.
Don’t go on in that way with a subordinate. If you are unable to
make up your quantum,* my boy, you had better address yourself to a
principal;* there are plenty of principals in the profession, you know,
and what is not worth the while of one, may be worth the while of
another; that’s my recommendation to you, speaking as a subordinate. Don’t try on useless measures. Why should you? Now, who’s
next?”
238 Great Expectations
Thus, we walked through Wemmick’s greenhouse, until he turned
to me and said, “Notice the man I shall shake hands with.” I should
have done so, without the preparation, as he had shaken hands with
no one yet.
Almost as soon as he had spoken, a portly upright man (whom I
can see now, as I write) in a well-worn olive-coloured frock-coat,
with a peculiar pallor overspreading the red in his complexion, and
eyes that went wandering about when he tried to fix them, came up
to a corner of the bars, and put his hand to his hat––which had a
greasy and fatty surface like cold broth––with a half-serious and
half-jocose military salute.
“Colonel, to you!” said Wemmick; “how are you, Colonel?”
“All right, Mr. Wemmick.”
“Everything was done that could be done, but the evidence was
too strong for us, Colonel.”
“Yes, it was too strong, sir––but I don’t care.”
“No, no,” said Wemmick, coolly, “you don’t care.” Then, turning
to me, “Served His Majesty this man. Was a soldier in the line and
bought his discharge.”
I said, “Indeed?” and the man’s eyes looked at me, and then
looked over my head, and then looked all round me, and then he
drew his hand across his lips and laughed.
“I think I shall be out of this on Monday, sir,” he said to
Wemmick.
“Perhaps,” returned my friend, “but there’s no knowing.”
“I am glad to have the chance of bidding you good-by, Mr. Wemmick,” said the man, stretching out his hand between two bars.
“Thankye,” said Wemmick, shaking hands with him. “Same to
you, Colonel.”
“If what I had upon me when taken, had been real, Mr. Wemmick,” said the man unwilling to let his hand go, “I should have
asked the favour of your wearing another ring––in acknowledgement
of your attentions.”
“I’ll accept the will for the deed,” said Wemmick. “By-the-by; you
were quite a pigeon-fancier.” The man looked up at the sky. “I am
told you had a remarkable breed of tumblers.* Could you commission any friend of yours to bring me a pair, if you’ve no further use
for ’em?”
“It shall be done, sir.”
xxxii] Volume II Chapter XIII 239
“All right,” said Wemmick, “they shall be taken care of. Good
afternoon, Colonel. Good-by!” They shook hands again, and as we
walked away Wemmick said to me, “A Coiner, a very good workman.
The Recorder’s report* is made to-day, and he is sure to be executed
on Monday. Still you see, as far as it goes, a pair of pigeons are
portable property, all the same.” With that, he looked back, and
nodded at this dead plant, and then cast his eyes about him in walking out of the yard, as if he were considering what other pot would
go best in its place.
As we came out of the prison through the lodge, I found that the
great importance of my guardian was appreciated by the turnkeys,
no less than by those whom they held in charge. “Well, Mr. Wemmick,” said the turnkey who kept us between the two studded and
spiked lodge gates, and who carefully locked one before he unlocked
the other, “what’s Mr. Jaggers going to do with that waterside murder? Is he going to make it manslaughter, or what’s he going to make
of it?”
“Why don’t you ask him?” returned Wemmick.
“Oh yes, I dare say!” said the turnkey.
“Now, that’s the way with them here, Mr. Pip,” remarked Wemmick, turning to me with his post-office elongated. “They don’t
mind what they ask of me, the subordinate; but you’ll never catch
’em asking any questions of my principal.”
“Is this young gentleman one of the ’prentices or articled ones* of
your office?” asked the turnkey, with a grin at Mr. Wemmick’s
humour.
“There he goes again, you see!” cried Wemmick, “I told you so!
Asks another question of the subordinate before his first is dry! Well,
supposing Mr. Pip is one of them?”
“Why then,” said the turnkey, grinning again, “he knows what
Mr. Jaggers is.”
“Yah!” cried Wemmick, suddenly hitting out at the turnkey in a
facetious way, “you’re as dumb as one of your own keys when you
have to do with my principal, you know you are. Let us out, you old
fox, or I’ll get him to bring an action against you for false
imprisonment.”
The turnkey laughed, and gave us good day, and stood laughing at
us over the spikes of the wicket when we descended the steps into
the street.
240 Great Expectations
“Mind you, Mr. Pip,” said Wemmick, gravely in my ear, as he took
my arm to be more confidential; “I don’t know that Mr. Jaggers does
a better thing than the way in which he keeps himself so high. He’s
always so high. His constant height is of a piece with his immense
abilities. That Colonel durst no more take leave of him, than that
turnkey durst ask him his intentions respecting a case. Then,
between his height and them, he slips in his subordinate––don’t you
see?––and so he has ’em, soul and body.”
I was very much impressed, and not for the first time, by my
guardian’s subtlety. To confess the truth, I very heartily wished, and
not for the first time, that I had had some other guardian of minor
abilities.
Mr. Wemmick and I parted at the office in Little Britain, where
suppliants for Mr. Jaggers’s notice were lingering about as usual, and
I returned to my watch in the street of the coach-office, with some
three hours on hand. I consumed the whole time in thinking how
strange it was that I should be encompassed by all this taint of prison
and crime; that, in my childhood out on our lonely marshes on a
winter evening I should have first encountered it; that, it should have
reappeared on two occasions, starting out like a stain that was faded
but not gone; that, it should in this new way pervade my fortune and
advancement. While my mind was thus engaged, I thought of the
beautiful young Estella, proud and refined, coming towards me, and
I thought with absolute abhorrence of the contrast between the jail
and her. I wished that Wemmick had not met me, or that I had not
yielded to him and gone with him, so that, of all days in the year on
this day, I might not have had Newgate in my breath and on my
clothes. I beat the prison dust off my feet as I sauntered to and fro,
and I shook it out of my dress, and I exhaled its air from my lungs.
So contaminated did I feel, remembering who was coming, that the
coach came quickly after all, and I was not yet free from the soiling
consciousness of Mr. Wemmick’s conservatory, when I saw her face
at the coach window and her hand waving to me.
What was the nameless shadow which again in that one instant
had passed?
xxxii] Volume II Chapter XIII 241
CHAPTER XIV
In her furred travelling-dress, Estella seemed more delicately beautiful than she had ever seemed yet, even in my eyes. Her manner was
more winning than she had cared to let it be to me before, and I
thought I saw Miss Havisham’s influence in the change.
We stood in the Inn Yard, while she pointed out her luggage to
me, and when it was all collected I remembered––having forgotten
everything but herself in the meanwhile––that I knew nothing of her
destination.
“I am going to Richmond,” she told me. “Our lesson is, that there
are two Richmonds, one in Surrey and one in Yorkshire, and that
mine is the Surrey Richmond. The distance is ten miles. I am to have
a carriage, and you are to take me. This is my purse, and you are to
pay my charges out of it. Oh, you must take the purse! We have no
choice, you and I, but to obey our instructions. We are not free to
follow our own devices, you and I.”
As she looked at me in giving me the purse, I hoped there was an
inner meaning in her words. She said them slightingly, but not with
displeasure.
“A carriage will have to be sent for, Estella. Will you rest here a
little?”
“Yes, I am to rest here a little, and I am to drink some tea, and you
are to take care of me the while.”
She drew her arm through mine, as if it must be done,* and I
requested a waiter who had been staring at the coach like a man who
had never seen such a thing in his life, to show us a private sittingroom. Upon that, he pulled out a napkin, as if it were a magic clue
without which he couldn’t find the way up-stairs, and led us to the
black hole of the establishment: fitted up with a diminishing mirror*
(quite a superfluous article considering the hole’s proportions), an
anchovy sauce-cruet, and somebody’s pattens.* On my objecting to
this retreat, he took us into another room with a dinner-table for
thirty, and in the grate a scorched leaf of a copy-book under a bushel
of coal-dust. Having looked at this extinct conflagration and shaken
his head, he took my order: which, proving to be merely “Some tea
for the lady,” sent him out of the room in a very low state of mind.
I was, and I am, sensible that the air of this chamber, in its strong
242 Great Expectations
combination of stable with soup-stock, might have led one to infer
that the coaching department was not doing well, and that the enterprising proprietor was boiling down the horses for the refreshment
department.* Yet the room was all in all to me, Estella being in it. I
thought that with her I could have been happy there for life. (I was
not at all happy there at the time, observe, and I knew it well.)
“Where are you going to, at Richmond?” I asked Estella.
“I am going to live,” said she, “at a great expense, with a lady
there, who has the power––or says she has––of taking me about, and
introducing me, and showing people to me and showing me to
people.”
“I suppose you will be glad of variety and admiration?”
“Yes, I suppose so.”
She answered so carelessly, that I said, “You speak of yourself as if
you were someone else.”
“Where did you learn how I speak of others? Come, come,” said
Estella, smiling delightfully, “you must not expect me to go to school
to you; I must talk in my own way. How do you thrive with Mr.
Pocket?”
“I live quite pleasantly there; at least––––” It appeared to me that
I was losing a chance.
“At least?” repeated Estella.
“As pleasantly as I could anywhere, away from you.”
“You silly boy,” said Estella, quite composedly, “how can you talk
such nonsense? Your friend Mr. Matthew, I believe, is superior to the
rest of his family?”
“Very superior indeed. He is nobody’s enemy––––”
“Don’t add but his own,” interposed Estella, “for I hate that class
of man. But he really is disinterested, and above small jealousy and
spite, I have heard?”
“I am sure I have every reason to say so.”
“You have not every reason to say so of the rest of his people,” said
Estella, nodding at me with an expression of face that was at once
grave and rallying, “for they beset Miss Havisham with reports and
insinuations to your disadvantage. They watch you, misrepresent
you, write letters about you (anonymous sometimes), and you are the
torment and the occupation of their lives. You can scarcely realise to
yourself the hatred those people feel for you.”
“They do me no harm, I hope?” said I.
xxxiii] Volume II Chapter XIV 243
Instead of answering, Estella burst out laughing. This was very
singular to me, and I looked at her in considerable perplexity. When
she left off––and she had not laughed languidly, but with real
enjoyment––I said, in my diffident way with her:
“I hope I may suppose that you would not be amused if they did
me any harm.”
“No, no, you may be sure of that,” said Estella. “You may be
certain that I laugh because they fail. Oh, those people with Miss
Havisham, and the tortures they undergo!” She laughed again, and
even now when she had told me why, her laughter was very singular
to me, for I could not doubt its being genuine, and yet it seemed too
much for the occasion. I thought there must really be something
more here than I knew; she saw the thought in my mind, and
answered it.
“It is not easy for even you,” said Estella, “to know what satisfaction it gives me to see those people thwarted, or what an enjoyable
sense of the ridiculous I have when they are made ridiculous. For
you were not brought up in that strange house from a mere baby.––I
was. You had not your little wits sharpened by their intriguing
against you, suppressed and defenceless, under the mask of sympathy and pity and what not that is soft and soothing.––I had. You
did not gradually open your round childish eyes wider and wider to
the discovery of that impostor of a woman who calculates her stores
of peace of mind for when she wakes up in the night.––I did.”
It was no laughing matter with Estella now, nor was she summoning these remembrances from any shallow place. I would not have
been the cause of that look of hers, for all my expectations in a heap.
“Two things I can tell you,” said Estella. “First, notwithstanding
the proverb that constant dropping will wear away a stone, you may
set your mind at rest that these people never will––never would, in a
hundred years––impair your ground with Miss Havisham, in any
particular, great or small. Second, I am beholden to you as the cause
of their being so busy and so mean in vain, and there is my hand
upon it.”
As she gave it me playfully––for her darker mood had been but
momentary––I held it and put it to my lips. “You ridiculous boy,”
said Estella, “will you never take warning? Or do you kiss my hand in
the spirit in which I once let you kiss my cheek?”
“What was it?” said I.
244 Great Expectations
“I must think a moment. A spirit of contempt for the fawners and
plotters.”
“If I say yes, may I kiss the cheek again?”
“You should have asked before you touched the hand. But, yes, if
you like.”
I leaned down, and her calm face was like a statue’s. “Now,” said
Estella, gliding away the instant I touched her cheek, “you are to take
care that I have some tea, and you are to take me to Richmond.”
Her reverting to this tone as if our association were forced upon us
and we were mere puppets, gave me pain; but everything in our
intercourse did give me pain. Whatever her tone with me happened
to be, I could put no trust in it, and build no hope on it; and yet I
went on against trust and against hope. Why repeat it a thousand
times? So it always was.
I rang for the tea, and the waiter, reappearing with his magic clue,
brought in by degrees some fifty adjuncts to that refreshment, but of
tea not a glimpse. A teaboard, cups and saucers, plates, knives and
forks (including carvers), spoons (various), salt-cellars, a meek little
muffin confined with the utmost precaution under a strong iron
cover, Moses in the bullrushes* typified by a soft bit of butter in a
quantity of parsley, a pale loaf with a powdered head, two proof
impressions of the bars of the kitchen fireplace on triangular bits of
bread, and ultimately a fat family urn: which the waiter staggered in
with, expressing in his countenance burden and suffering. After a
prolonged absence at this stage of the entertainment, he at length
came back with a casket of precious appearance containing twigs.
These I steeped in hot water, and so from the whole of these appliances extracted one cup of I don’t know what, for Estella.
The bill paid, and the waiter remembered, and the ostler not
forgotten, and the chambermaid taken into consideration––in a
word, the whole house bribed into a state of contempt and animosity,
and Estella’s purse much lightened––we got into our post-coach and
drove away. Turning into Cheapside and rattling up Newgate-street,
we were soon under the walls of which I was so ashamed.
“What place is that?” Estella asked me.
I made a foolish pretence of not at first recognising it, and then
told her. As she looked at it, and drew in her head again, murmuring
“Wretches!” I would not have confessed to my visit for any
consideration.
xxxiii] Volume II Chapter XIV 245
“Mr. Jaggers,” said I, by way of putting it neatly on somebody
else, “has the reputation of being more in the secrets of that dismal
place than any man in London.”
“He is more in the secrets of every place, I think,” said Estella, in a
low voice.
“You have been accustomed to see him often, I suppose?”
“I have been accustomed to see him at uncertain intervals, ever
since I can remember. But I know him no better now, than I did
before I could speak plainly. What is your own experience of him?
Do you advance with him?”
“Once habituated to his distrustful manner,” said I, “I have done
very well.”
“Are you intimate?”
“I have dined with him at his private house.”
“I fancy,” said Estella, shrinking, “that must be a curious place.”
“It is a curious place.”
I should have been chary of discussing my guardian too freely
even with her; but I should have gone on with the subject so far as to
describe the dinner in Gerrard-street, if we had not then come into a
sudden glare of gas. It seemed, while it lasted, to be all alight and
alive with that inexplicable feeling I had had before; and when we
were out of it, I was as much dazed for a few moments as if I had
been in Lightning.
So, we fell into other talk, and it was principally about the way by
which we were travelling, and about what parts of London lay on
this side of it, and what on that. The great city was almost new to
her, she told me, for she had never left Miss Havisham’s neighbourhood until she had gone to France, and she had merely passed
through London then in going and returning. I asked her if my
guardian had any charge of her while she remained here? To that she
emphatically said “God forbid!” and no more.
It was impossible for me to avoid seeing that she cared to attract
me; that she made herself winning; and would have won me even if
the task had needed pains. Yet this made me none the happier, for,
even if she had not taken that tone of our being disposed of by
others, I should have felt that she held my heart in her hand because
she wilfully chose to do it, and not because it would have wrung any
tenderness in her, to crush it and throw it away.
When we passed through Hammersmith, I showed her where Mr.
246 Great Expectations
Matthew Pocket lived, and said it was no great way from Richmond,
and that I hoped I should see her sometimes.
“Oh yes, you are to see me; you are to come when you think
proper; you are to be mentioned to the family; indeed you are already
mentioned.”
I inquired was it a large household she was going to be a member
of?
“No; there are only two; mother and daughter. The mother is a
lady of some station, I believe, though not averse to increasing her
income.”
“I wonder Miss Havisham could part with you again so soon.”
“It is part of Miss Havisham’s plans for me, Pip,” said Estella,
with a sigh, as if she were tired; “I am to write to her constantly and
see her regularly, and report how I go on––I and the jewels––for they
are nearly all mine now.”
It was the first time she had ever called me by my name. Of course
she did so, purposely, and knew that I should treasure it up.
We came to Richmond all too soon, and our destination there, was
a house by the Green; a staid old house, where hoops and powder
and patches,* embroidered coats rolled stockings ruffles and swords,
had had their court days many a time. Some ancient trees before
the house were still cut into fashions as formal and unnatural as the
hoops and wigs and stiff skirts; but their own allotted places in
the great procession of the dead were not far off, and they would
soon drop into them and go the silent way of the rest.
A bell with an old voice––which I dare say in its time had often
said to the house, Here is the green farthingale, Here is the
diamond-hilted sword, Here are the shoes with red heels and the
blue solitaire,*––sounded gravely in the moonlight, and two cherrycoloured maids came fluttering out to receive Estella. The doorway
soon absorbed her boxes, and she gave me her hand and a smile, and
said good night, and was absorbed likewise. And still I stood looking
at the house, thinking how happy I should be if I lived there with her,
and knowing that I never was happy with her, but always miserable.
I got into the carriage to be taken back to Hammersmith, and I got
in with a bad heart-ache, and I got out with a worse heart-ache. At
our own door, I found little Jane Pocket coming home from a little
party escorted by her little lover; and I envied her little lover, in spite
of his being subject to Flopson.
xxxiii] Volume II Chapter XIV 247
Mr. Pocket was out lecturing; for, he was a most delightful lecturer on domestic economy, and his treatises on the management of
children and servants were considered the very best text-books on
those themes. But, Mrs. Pocket was at home, and was in a little
difficulty, on account of the baby’s having been accommodated with
a needle-case to keep him quiet during the unaccountable absence
(with a relative in the Foot Guards) of Millers. And more needles
were missing, than it could be regarded as quite wholesome for a
patient of such tender years either to apply externally or to take as a
tonic.
Mr. Pocket being justly celebrated for giving most excellent practical advice, and for having a clear and sound perception of things
and a highly judicious mind, I had some notion in my heart-ache of
begging him to accept my confidence. But, happening to look up at
Mrs. Pocket as she sat reading her book of dignities after prescribing
Bed as a sovereign remedy for baby, I thought––Well––No, I
wouldn’t.
CHAPTER XV
As I had grown accustomed to my expectations, I had insensibly
begun to notice their effect upon myself and those around me. Their
influence on my own character, I disguised from my recognition as
much as possible, but I knew very well that it was not all good. I lived
in a state of chronic uneasiness respecting my behaviour to Joe. My
conscience was not by any means comfortable about Biddy. When I
woke up in the night––like Camilla––I used to think, with a weariness on my spirits, that I should have been happier and better if I had
never seen Miss Havisham’s face, and had risen to manhood content
to be partners with Joe in the honest old forge. Many a time of an
evening, when I sat alone looking at the fire, I thought, after all there
was no fire like the forge fire and the kitchen fire at home.
Yet Estella was so inseparable from all my restlessness and disquiet of mind, that I really fell into confusion as to the limits of my
own part in its production. That is to say, supposing I had had no
expectations, and yet had had Estella to think of, I could not make
out to my satisfaction that I should have done much better. Now,
concerning the influence of my position on others, I was in no such
248 Great Expectations
difficulty, and so I perceived––though dimly enough perhaps––that
it was not beneficial to anybody, and, above all, that it was not beneficial to Herbert. My lavish habits led his easy nature into expenses
that he could not afford, corrupted the simplicity of his life, and
disturbed his peace with anxieties and regrets. I was not at all
remorseful for having unwittingly set those other branches of the
Pocket family to the poor arts they practised: because such littlenesses were their natural bent, and would have been evoked by anybody else, if I had left them slumbering. But Herbert’s was a very
different case, and it often caused me a twinge to think that I had
done him evil service in crowding his sparely-furnished chambers
with incongruous upholstery work, and placing the canary-breasted*
Avenger at his disposal.
So now, as an infallible way of making little ease great ease, I
began to contract a quantity of debt. I could hardly begin but Herbert must begin too, so he soon followed. At Startop’s suggestion, we
put ourselves down for election into a club called The Finches of the
Grove: the object of which institution I have never divined, if it were
not that the members should dine expensively once a fortnight, to
quarrel among themselves as much as possible after dinner, and to
cause six waiters to get drunk on the stairs. I know that these gratifying social ends were so invariably accomplished, that Herbert and I
understood nothing else to be referred to in the first standing toast of
the society: which ran “Gentlemen, may the present promotion of
good feeling ever reign predominant among the Finches of the
Grove.”*
The Finches spent their money foolishly (the Hotel we dined at
was in Covent-garden), and the first Finch I saw, when I had the
honour of joining the Grove, was Bentley Drummle: at that time
floundering about town in a cab of his own, and doing a great deal of
damage to the posts at the street corners.* Occasionally, he shot himself out of his equipage head-foremost over the apron; and I saw him
on one occasion deliver himself at the door of the Grove in this
unintentional way––like coals. But here I anticipate a little, for I was
not a Finch, and could not be, according to the sacred laws of the
society, until I came of age.
In my confidence in my own resources, I would willingly have
taken Herbert’s expenses on myself; but Herbert was proud, and I
could make no such proposal to him. So, he got into difficulties in
xxxiv] Volume II Chapter XV 249
every direction, and continued to look about him. When we gradually fell into keeping late hours and late company, I noticed that
he looked about him with a desponding eye at breakfast-time;
that he began to look about him more hopefully about mid-day; that
he drooped when he came in to dinner; that he seemed to descry
Capital in the distance rather clearly, after dinner; that he all but
realised Capital towards midnight; and that at about two o’clock in
the morning, he became so deeply despondent again as to talk of
buying a rifle and going to America, with a general purpose of
compelling buffaloes to make his fortune.
I was usually at Hammersmith about half the week, and when I
was at Hammersmith I haunted Richmond: whereof separately byand-by. Herbert would often come to Hammersmith when I was
there, and I think at those seasons his father would occasionally have
some passing perception that the opening he was looking for, had not
appeared yet. But in the general tumbling up of the family, his tumbling out in life somewhere, was a thing to transact itself somehow.
In the mean time Mr. Pocket grew greyer, and tried oftener to lift
himself out of his perplexities by the hair. While Mrs. Pocket tripped
up the family with her footstool, read her book of dignities, lost her
pocket-handkerchief, told us about her grandpapa, and taught the
young idea how to shoot, by shooting it into bed* whenever it
attracted her notice.
As I am now generalising a period of my life with the object of
clearing my way before me, I can scarcely do so better than by at
once completing the description of our usual manners and customs
at Barnard’s Inn.
We spent as much money as we could, and got as little for it as
people could make up their minds to give us. We were always more
or less miserable, and most of our acquaintance were in the same
condition. There was a gay fiction among us that we were constantly
enjoying ourselves, and a skeleton truth that we never did. To the
best of my belief, our case was in the last aspect a rather common
one.
Every morning, with an air ever new, Herbert went into the City
to look about him. I often paid him a visit in the dark back-room in
which he consorted with an ink-jar, a hat-peg, a coal-box, a stringbox, an almanack, a desk and stool, and a ruler; and I do not remember that I ever saw him do anything else but look about him. If we all
250 Great Expectations
did what we undertake to do, as faithfully as Herbert did, we might
live in a Republic of the Virtues.* He had nothing else to do, poor
fellow, except at a certain hour of every afternoon to “go to
Lloyd’s”*––in observance of a ceremony of seeing his principal, I
think. He never did anything else in connexion with Lloyd’s that I
could find out, except come back again. When he felt his case
unusually serious, and that he positively must find an opening, he
would go on ’Change at a busy time, and walk in and out, in a kind of
gloomy country dance figure, among the assembled magnates. “For,”
says Herbert to me, coming home to dinner on one of those special
occasions, “I find the truth to be, Handel, that an opening won’t
come to one, but one must go to it––––so I have been.”
If we had been less attached to one another, I think we must have
hated one another regularly every morning. I detested the chambers
beyond expression at that period of repentance, and could not
endure the sight of the Avenger’s livery: which had a more expensive
and a less remunerative appearance then, than at any other time in
the four-and-twenty hours. As we got more and more into debt,
breakfast became a hollower and hollower form, and, being on one
occasion at breakfast-time threatened (by letter) with legal proceedings, “not unwholly unconnected,” as my local paper might put it,
“with jewellery,” I went so far as to seize the Avenger by his blue
collar and shake him off his feet––so that he was actually in the air,
like a booted Cupid––for presuming to suppose that we wanted a
roll.
At certain times––meaning at uncertain times, for they depended
on our humour––I would say to Herbert, as if it were a remarkable
discovery:
“My dear Herbert, we are getting on badly.”
“My dear Handel,” Herbert would say to me, in all sincerity, “if
you will believe me, those very words were on my lips, by a strange
coincidence.”
“Then, Herbert,” I would respond, “let us look into our affairs.”
We always derived profound satisfaction from making an
appointment for this purpose. I always thought this was business,
this was the way to confront the thing, this was the way to take the
foe by the throat. And I know Herbert thought so too.
We ordered something rather special for dinner, with a bottle of
something similarly out of the common way, in order that our minds
xxxiv] Volume II Chapter XV 251
might be fortified for the occasion, and we might come well up to the
mark. Dinner over, we produced a bundle of pens, a copious supply
of ink, and a goodly show of writing and blotting paper. For, there
was something very comfortable in having plenty of stationery.
I would then take a sheet of paper, and write across the top of it, in
a neat hand, the heading, “Memorandum of Pip’s debts;” with Barnard’s Inn and the date very carefully added. Herbert would also
take a sheet of paper, and write across it with similar formalities,
“Memorandum of Herbert’s debts.”
Each of us would then refer to a confused heap of papers at his
side, which had been thrown into drawers, worn into holes in pockets, half-burnt in lighting candles, stuck for weeks into the lookingglass, and otherwise damaged. The sound of our pens going,
refreshed us exceedingly, insomuch that I sometimes found it difficult to distinguish between this edifying business proceeding and
actually paying the money. In point of meritorious character, the two
things seemed about equal.
When we had written a little while, I would ask Herbert how he
got on? Herbert probably would have been scratching his head in a
most rueful manner at the sight of his accumulating figures.
“They are mounting up, Handel,” Herbert would say; “upon my
life, they are mounting up.”
“Be firm, Herbert,” I would retort, plying my own pen with great
assiduity. “Look the thing in the face. Look into your affairs. Stare
them out of countenance.”
“So I would, Handel, only they are staring me out of
countenance.”
However, my determined manner would have its effect, and Herbert would fall to work again. After a time he would give up once
more, on the plea that he had not got Cobbs’s bill, or Lobbs’s, or
Nobbs’s, as the case might be.
“Then, Herbert, estimate; estimate it in round numbers, and put
it down.”
“What a fellow of resource you are!” my friend would reply, with
admiration. “Really your business powers are very remarkable.”
I thought so too. I established with myself on these occasions, the
reputation of a first-rate man of business––prompt, decisive, energetic, clear, cool-headed. When I had got all my responsibilities
down upon my list, I compared each with the bill, and ticked it off.
252 Great Expectations
My self-approval when I ticked an entry was quite a luxurious sensation. When I had no more ticks to make, I folded all my bills up
uniformly, docketed each on the back, and tied the whole into a
symmetrical bundle. Then I did the same for Herbert (who modestly
said he had not my administrative genius), and felt that I had
brought his affairs into a focus for him.
My business habits had one other bright feature, which I called
“leaving a Margin.” For example; supposing Herbert’s debts to be
one hundred and sixty-four pounds four-and-twopence, I would say,
“Leave a margin, and put them down at two hundred.” Or, supposing my own to be four times as much, I would leave a margin, and
put them down at seven hundred. I had the highest opinion of the
wisdom of this same Margin, but I am bound to acknowledge that on
looking back, I deem it to have been an expensive device. For, we
always ran into new debt immediately, to the full extent of the margin, and sometimes in the sense of freedom and solvency it imparted,
got pretty far on into another margin.
But there was a calm, a rest, a virtuous hush, consequent on these
examinations of our affairs that gave me, for the time, an admirable
opinion of myself. Soothed by my exertions, my method, and Herbert’s compliments, I would sit with his symmetrical bundle and my
own on the table before me among the stationery, and feel like a bank
of some sort, rather than a private individual.
We shut our outer door on these solemn occasions, in order that
we might not be interrupted. I had fallen into my serene state one
evening, when we heard a letter dropped through the slit in the said
door, and fall on the ground. “It’s for you, Handel,” said Herbert,
going out and coming back with it, “and I hope there is nothing the
matter.” This was in allusion to its heavy black seal and border.*
The letter was signed Trabb & Co., and its contents were simply,
that I was an honoured sir, and that they begged to inform me that
Mrs. J. Gargery had departed this life on Monday last, at twenty
minutes past six in the evening, and that my attendance was
requested at the interment on Monday next at three o’clock in the
afternoon.

CHAPTER XVI
It was the first time that a grave had opened in my road of life, and
the gap it made in the smooth ground was wonderful. The figure of
my sister in her chair by the kitchen fire, haunted me night and day.
That the place could possibly be, without her, was something my
mind seemed unable to compass; and whereas she had seldom or
never been in my thoughts of late, I had now the strangest ideas that
she was coming towards me in the street, or that she would presently
knock at the door. In my rooms too, with which she had never been
at all associated, there was at once the blankness of death and a
perpetual suggestion of the sound of her voice or the turn of her face
or figure, as if she were still alive and had been often there.
Whatever my fortunes might have been, I could scarcely have
recalled my sister with much tenderness. But I suppose there is a
shock of regret which may exist without much tenderness. Under its
influence (and perhaps to make up for the want of the softer feeling)
I was seized with a violent indignation against the assailant from
whom she had suffered so much; and I felt that on sufficient proof I
could have revengefully pursued Orlick, or anyone else, to the last
extremity.
Having written to Joe, to offer consolation, and to assure him that
I should come to the funeral, I passed the intermediate days in the
curious state of mind I have glanced at. I went down early in the
morning, and alighted at the Blue Boar in good time to walk over to
the forge.
It was fine summer weather again, and, as I walked along, the
times when I was a little helpless creature, and my sister did not
spare me, vividly returned. But they returned with a gentle tone
upon them that softened even the edge of Tickler. For now, the very
breath of the beans and clover whispered to my heart that the day
must come when it would be well for my memory that others walking in the sunshine should be softened as they thought of me.
At last I came within sight of the house, and saw that Trabb and
Co. had put in a funereal execution, and taken possession.* Two
dismally absurd persons, each ostentatiously exhibiting a crutch
done up in a black bandage––as if that instrument could possibly
communicate any comfort to anybody––were posted at the front
254 Great Expectations
door;* and in one of them I recognised a postboy discharged from
the Boar for turning a young couple into a sawpit on their bridal
morning, in consequence of intoxication rendering it necessary for
him to ride his horse clasped round the neck with both arms. All the
children of the village, and most of the women, were admiring these
sable warders and the closed windows of the house and forge; and as
I came up, one of the two warders (the postboy) knocked at the
door––implying that I was far too much exhausted by grief, to have
strength remaining to knock for myself.
Another sable warder (a carpenter, who had once eaten two geese
for a wager) opened the door, and showed me into the best parlour.
Here, Mr. Trabb had taken unto himself the best table, and had got
all the leaves up, and was holding a kind of black Bazaar, with the aid
of a quantity of black pins. At the moment of my arrival, he had just
finished putting somebody’s hat into black long-clothes,* like an
African baby; so he held out his hand for mine. But I, misled by the
action, and confused by the occasion, shook hands with him with
every testimony of warm affection.
Poor dear Joe, entangled in a little black cloak tied in a large bow
under his chin, was seated apart at the upper end of the room;
where, as chief mourner, he had evidently been stationed by Trabb.
When I bent down and said to him, “Dear Joe, how are you?” he
said, “Pip, old chap, you knowed her when she were a fine figure of
a––––” and clasped my hand and said no more.
Biddy, looking very neat and modest in her black dress, went
quietly here and there, and was very helpful. When I had spoken to
Biddy, as I thought it not a time for talking I went and sat down near
Joe, and there began to wonder in what part of the house it––she––
my sister––was. The air of the parlour being faint with the smell
of sweet cake, I looked about for the table of refreshments; it was
scarcely visible until one had got accustomed to the gloom, but there
was a cut-up plum-cake upon it, and there were cut-up oranges, and
sandwiches, and biscuits, and two decanters that I knew very well as
ornaments, but had never seen used in all my life; one full of port,
and one of sherry. Standing at this table, I became conscious of the
servile Pumblechook in a black cloak and several yards of hatband,
who was alternately stuffing himself, and making obsequious movements to catch my attention. The moment he succeeded, he came
over to me (breathing sherry and crumbs), and said in a subdued
xxxv] Volume II Chapter XVI 255
voice, “May I, dear sir?” and did. I then descried Mr. and Mrs.
Hubble; the last-named in a decent speechless paroxysm in a corner.
We were all going to “follow,” and were all in course of being tied up
separately (by Trabb) into ridiculous bundles.
“Which I meantersay, Pip,” Joe whispered me, as we were being
what Mr. Trabb called “formed” in the parlour, two and two––and it
was dreadfully like a preparation for some grim kind of dance;
“which I meantersay, sir, as I would in preference have carried her to
the church myself, along with three or four friendly ones wot come
to it with willing harts and arms, but it were considered wot the
neighbours would look down on such and would be of opinions as it
were wanting in respect.”
“Pocket-handkerchiefs out, all!” cried Mr. Trabb at this point, in a
depressed business-like voice. “Pocket-handkerchiefs out! We are
ready!”
So, we all put our pocket-handkerchiefs to our faces, as if our
noses were bleeding, and filed out two and two; Joe and I; Biddy and
Pumblechook; Mr. and Mrs. Hubble. The remains of my poor sister
had been brought round by the kitchen door, and, it being a point
of Undertaking ceremony that the six bearers must be stifled and
blinded under a horrible black velvet housing with a white border,
the whole looked like a blind monster with twelve human legs,
shuffling and blundering along, under the guidance of two keepers––
the postboy and his comrade.
The neighbourhood, however, highly approved of these arrangements, and we were much admired as we went through the village;
the more youthful and vigorous part of the community making
dashes now and then to cut us off, and lying in wait to intercept us
at points of vantage. At such times the more exuberant among
them called out in an excited manner on our emergence round some
corner of expectancy, “Here they come!” “Here they are!” and we
were all but cheered. In this progress I was much annoyed by the
abject Pumblechook, who, being behind me, persisted all the way as
a delicate attention in arranging my streaming hatband, and
smoothing my cloak. My thoughts were further distracted by the
excessive pride of Mr. and Mrs. Hubble, who were surpassingly
conceited and vainglorious in being members of so distinguished
a procession.
And now, the range of marshes lay clear before us, with the sails of
256 Great Expectations
the ships on the river growing out of it; and we went into the
churchyard, close to the graves of my unknown parents, Philip Pirrip, late of this parish, and Also Georgiana, Wife of the Above. And
there, my sister was laid quietly in the earth while the larks sang high
above it, and the light wind strewed it with beautiful shadows of
clouds and trees.
Of the conduct of the worldly-minded Pumblechook while this
was doing, I desire to say no more than that it was all addressed to
me; and that even when those noble passages were read which
remind humanity how it brought nothing into the world and can take
nothing out, and how it fleeth like a shadow and never continueth
long in one stay,* I heard him cough a reservation of the case of a
young gentleman who came unexpectedly into large property.
When we got back, he had the hardihood to tell me that he wished
my sister could have known I had done her so much honour,
and to hint that she would have considered it reasonably purchased
at the price of her death. After that, he drank all the rest of
the sherry, and Mr. Hubble drank the port, and the two talked
(which I have since observed to be customary in such cases) as
if they were of quite another race from the deceased, and were
notoriously immortal. Finally, he went away with Mr. and Mrs.
Hubble––to make an evening of it, I felt sure, and to tell the Jolly
Bargemen that he was the founder of my fortunes and my earliest
benefactor.
When they were all gone, and when Trabb and his men––but not
his boy: I looked for him––had crammed their mummery into bags,
and were gone too, the house felt wholesomer. Soon afterwards,
Biddy, Joe, and I, had a cold dinner together; but we dined in the best
parlour, not in the old kitchen, and Joe was so exceedingly particular
what he did with his knife and fork and the salt-cellar and what not,
that there was great restraint upon us. But after dinner, when I made
him take his pipe, and when I had loitered with him about the forge,
and when we sat down together on the great block of stone outside it,
we got on better. I noticed that after the funeral Joe changed his
clothes so far, as to make a compromise between his Sunday dress
and working dress: in which the dear fellow looked natural, and like
the Man he was.
He was very much pleased by my asking if I might sleep in my
own little room, and I was rather pleased too; for I felt that I had
xxxv] Volume II Chapter XVI 257
done rather a great thing in making the request. When the shadows
of evening were closing in, I took an opportunity of getting into the
garden with Biddy for a little talk.
“Biddy,” said I, “I think you might have written to me about these
sad matters.”
“Do you, Mr. Pip?” said Biddy. “I should have written if I had
thought that.”
“Don’t suppose that I mean to be unkind, Biddy, when I say I
consider that you ought to have thought that.”
“Do you, Mr. Pip?”
She was so quiet, and had such an orderly, good, and pretty way
with her, that I did not like the thought of making her cry again.
After looking a little at her downcast eyes as she walked beside me, I
gave up that point.
“I suppose it will be difficult for you to remain here now, Biddy
dear?”
“Oh! I can’t do so, Mr. Pip,” said Biddy, in a tone of regret, but
still of quiet conviction. “I have been speaking to Mrs. Hubble, and I
am going to her to-morrow. I hope we shall be able to take some care
of Mr. Gargery, together, until he settles down.”
“How are you going to live, Biddy? If you want any mo––––”
“How am I going to live?” repeated Biddy, striking in, with a
momentary flush upon her face. “I’ll tell you, Mr. Pip. I am going to
try to get the place of mistress in the new school nearly finished here.
I can be well recommended by all the neighbours, and I hope I can be
industrious and patient, and teach myself while I teach others. You
know, Mr. Pip,” pursued Biddy, with a smile, as she raised her eyes to
my face, “the new schools are not like the old, but I learnt a good
deal from you after that time, and have had time since then to
improve.”
“I think you would always improve, Biddy, under any
circumstances.”
“Ah! Except in my bad side of human nature,” murmured Biddy.
It was not so much a reproach, as an irresistible thinking aloud.
Well! I thought I would give up that point too. So, I walked a little
further with Biddy, looking silently at her downcast eyes.
“I have not heard the particulars of my sister’s death, Biddy.”
“They are very slight, poor thing. She had been in one of her bad
states––though they had got better of late, rather than worse––for
258 Great Expectations
four days, when she came out of it in the evening, just at tea-time,
and said quite plainly, ‘Joe.’ As she had never said any word for a long
while, I ran and fetched in Mr. Gargery from the forge. She made
signs to me that she wanted him to sit down close to her, and wanted
me to put her arms round his neck. So I put them round his neck,
and she laid her head down on his shoulder quite content and satisfied. And so she presently said ‘Joe’ again, and once ‘Pardon,’ and
once ‘Pip.’ And so she never lifted her head up any more, and it was
just an hour later when we laid it down on her own bed, because we
found she was gone.”
Biddy cried; the darkening garden, and the lane, and the stars that
were coming out, were blurred in my own sight.
“Nothing was ever discovered, Biddy?”
“Nothing.”
“Do you know what is become of Orlick?”
“I should think from the colour of his clothes that he is working in
the quarries.”
“Of course you have seen him then?––Why are you looking at that
dark tree in the lane?”
“I saw him there, on the night she died.”
“That was not the last time either, Biddy?”
“No; I have seen him there, since we have been walking here.––It
is of no use,” said Biddy, laying her hand upon my arm, as I was for
running out, “you know I would not deceive you; he was not there a
minute, and he is gone.”
It revived my utmost indignation to find that she was still pursued
by this fellow, and I felt inveterate against him. I told her so, and told
her that I would spend any money or take any pains to drive him out
of that country. By degrees she led me into more temperate talk, and
she told me how Joe loved me, and how Joe never complained of
anything––she didn’t say, of me; she had no need; I knew what she
meant––but ever did his duty in his way of life, with a strong hand, a
quiet tongue, and a gentle heart.
“Indeed, it would be hard to say too much for him,” said I; “and
Biddy, we must often speak of these things, for of course I shall be
often down here now. I am not going to leave poor Joe alone.”
Biddy said never a single word.
“Biddy, don’t you hear me?”
“Yes, Mr. Pip.”
xxxv] Volume II Chapter XVI 259
“Not to mention your calling me Mr. Pip––which appears to me
to be in bad taste, Biddy––what do you mean?”
“What do I mean?” asked Biddy, timidly.
“Biddy,” said I, in a virtuously self-asserting manner, “I must
request to know what you mean by this?”
“By this?” said Biddy.
“Now, don’t echo,” I retorted. “You used not to echo, Biddy.”
“Used not!” said Biddy. “O Mr. Pip! Used!”
Well! I rather thought I would give up that point too. After
another silent turn in the garden, I fell back on the main position.
“Biddy,” said I, “I made a remark respecting my coming down
here often, to see Joe, which you received with a marked silence.
Have the goodness, Biddy, to tell me why.”
“Are you quite sure, then, that you will come to see him often?”
asked Biddy, stopping in the narrow garden walk, and looking at me
under the stars with a clear and honest eye.
“Oh dear me!” said I, as if I found myself compelled to give up
Biddy in despair. “This really is a very bad side of human nature!
Don’t say any more, if you please, Biddy. This shocks me very
much.”
For which cogent reason I kept Biddy at a distance during supper,
and, when I went up to my own old little room, took as stately a leave
of her as I could, in my murmuring soul, deem reconcilable with the
churchyard and the event of the day. As often as I was restless in the
night, and that was every quarter of an hour, I reflected what an
unkindness, what an injury, what an injustice, Biddy had done me.
Early in the morning, I was to go. Early in the morning, I was out,
and, looking in, unseen, at one of the wooden windows of the forge.
There I stood, for minutes, looking at Joe, already at work with a
glow of health and strength upon his face that made it show as if the
bright sun of the life in store for him were shining on it.
“Good-by, dear Joe!––No, don’t wipe it off––for God’s sake, give
me your blackened hand!––I shall be down soon, and often.”
“Never too soon, sir,” said Joe, “and never too often, Pip!”
Biddy was waiting for me at the kitchen door, with a mug of new
milk and a crust of bread. “Biddy,” said I, when I gave her my hand
at parting, “I am not angry, but I am hurt.”
“No, don’t be hurt,” she pleaded quite pathetically; “let only me
be hurt, if I have been ungenerous.”
260 Great Expectations
Once more, the mists were rising as I walked away. If they disclosed to me, as I suspect they did, that I should not come back, and
that Biddy was quite right, all I can say is––they were quite right too.
CHAPTER XVII
Herbert and I went on from bad to worse, in the way of increasing
our debts, looking into our affairs, leaving Margins, and the like
exemplary transactions; and Time went on, whether or no, as he has
a way of doing; and I came of age––in fulfilment of Herbert’s prediction, that I should do so before I knew where I was.
Herbert himself had come of age, eight months before me. As he
had nothing else than his majority to come into, the event did not
make a profound sensation in Barnard’s Inn. But we had looked
forward to my one-and-twentieth birthday, with a crowd of speculations and anticipations, for we had both considered that my guardian
could hardly help saying something definite on that occasion.
I had taken care to have it well understood in Little Britain, when
my birthday was. On the day before it, I received an official note
from Wemmick, informing me that Mr. Jaggers would be glad if I
would call upon him at five in the afternoon of the auspicious day.
This convinced us that something great was to happen, and threw
me into an unusual flutter when I repaired to my guardian’s office, a
model of punctuality.
In the outer office Wemmick offered me his congratulations, and
incidentally rubbed the side of his nose with a folded piece of tissuepaper* that I liked the look of. But he said nothing respecting it, and
motioned me with a nod into my guardian’s room. It was November,
and my guardian was standing before his fire leaning his back against
the chimney-piece, with his hands under his coat-tails.
“Well, Pip,” said he, “I must call you Mr. Pip to-day. Congratulations, Mr. Pip.”
We shook hands––he was always a remarkably short shaker––and I
thanked him.
“Take a chair, Mr. Pip,” said my guardian.
As I sat down, and he preserved his attitude and bent his brows at
his boots, I felt at a disadvantage, which reminded me of that old time
when I had been put upon a tombstone. The two ghastly casts on the
xxxvi] Volume II Chapter XVII 261
shelf were not far from him, and their expression was as if they were
making a stupid apoplectic attempt to attend to the conversation.
“Now my young friend,” my guardian began, as if I were a witness
in the box, “I am going to have a word or two with you.”
“If you please, sir.”
“What do you suppose,” said Mr Jaggers, bending forward to look
at the ground, and then throwing his head back to look at the ceiling,
“what do you suppose you are living at the rate of?”
“At the rate of, sir?”
“At,” repeated Mr. Jaggers, still looking at the ceiling, “the––
rate––of?” And then looked all round the room, and paused with his
pocket-handkerchief in his hand, half way to his nose.
I had looked into my affairs so often, that I had thoroughly destroyed any slight notion I might ever have had of their bearings.
Reluctantly, I confessed myself quite unable to answer the question.
This reply seemed agreeable to Mr. Jaggers, who said, “I thought
so!” and blew his nose with an air of satisfaction.
“Now, I have asked you a question, my friend,” said Mr. Jaggers.
“Have you anything to ask me?”
“Of course it would be a great relief to me to ask you several
questions, sir; but I remember your prohibition.”
“Ask one,” said Mr. Jaggers.
“Is my benefactor to be made known to me to-day?”
“No. Ask another.”
“Is that confidence to be imparted to me soon?”
“Waive that, a moment,” said Mr. Jaggers, “and ask another.”
I looked about me, but there appeared to be now no possible
escape from the inquiry, “Have––I––anything to receive, sir?” On
that, Mr. Jaggers said, triumphantly, “I thought we should come
to it!” and called to Wemmick to give him that piece of paper.
Wemmick appeared, handed it in, and disappeared.
“Now, Mr. Pip,” said Mr. Jaggers, “attend, if you please. You have
been drawing pretty freely here; your name occurs pretty often in
Wemmick’s cash-book; but you are in debt, of course?”
“I am afraid I must say yes, sir.”
“You know you must say yes; don’t you?” said Mr. Jaggers.
“Yes, sir.”
“I don’t ask you what you owe, because you don’t know; and if you
did know, you wouldn’t tell me; you would say less. Yes, yes, my
262 Great Expectations
friend,” cried Mr. Jaggers, waving his forefinger to stop me, as I
made a show of protesting: “it’s likely enough that you think you
wouldn’t, but you would. You’ll excuse me, but I know better than
you. Now, take this piece of paper in your hand. You have got it?
Very good. Now unfold it and tell me what it is.”
“This is a bank-note,” said I, “for five hundred pounds.”
“That is a bank-note,” repeated Mr. Jaggers, “for five hundred
pounds. And a very handsome sum of money too, I think. You consider it so?”
“How could I do otherwise!”
“Ah! But answer the question,” said Mr. Jaggers.
“Undoubtedly.”
“You consider it, undoubtedly, a handsome sum of money. Now,
that handsome sum of money, Pip, is your own. It is a present to you on
this day, in earnest of your expectations. And at the rate of that handsome sum of money per annum, and at no higher rate, you are to live
until the donor of the whole appears. That is to say, you will now take
your money affairs entirely into your own hands, and you will draw
from Wemmick one hundred and twenty-five pounds per quarter,
until you are in communication with the fountain-head, and no longer
with the mere agent. As I have told you before, I am the mere agent.
I execute my instructions, and I am paid for doing so. I think them
injudicious, but I am not paid for giving any opinion on their merits.”
I was beginning to express my gratitude to my benefactor for the
great liberality with which I was treated, when Mr. Jaggers stopped
me. “I am not paid, Pip,” said he, coolly, “to carry your words to any
one;” and then gathered up his coat-tails, as he had gathered up the
subject, and stood frowning at his boots as if he suspected them of
designs against him.
After a pause, I hinted:
“There was a question just now, Mr. Jaggers, which you desired
me to waive for a moment. I hope I am doing nothing wrong in
asking it again?”
“What is it?” said he.
I might have known that he would never help me out; but it took
me aback to have to shape the question afresh, as if it were quite
new. “Is it likely,” I said, after hesitating, “that my patron, the
fountain-head you have spoken of, Mr. Jaggers, will soon––––” there
I delicately stopped.
xxxvi] Volume II Chapter XVII 263
“Will soon what?” asked Mr. Jaggers. “That’s no question as it
stands, you know.”
“Will soon come to London,” said I, after casting about for a
precise form of words, “or summon me anywhere else?”
“Now here,” replied Mr. Jaggers, fixing me for the first time with
his dark deep-set eyes, “we must revert to the evening when we first
encountered one another in your village. What did I tell you then,
Pip?”
“You told me, Mr. Jaggers, that it might be years hence when that
person appeared.”
“Just so,” said Mr. Jaggers; “that’s my answer.”
As we looked full at one another, I felt my breath come quicker in
my strong desire to get something out of him. And as I felt that it
came quicker, and as I felt that he saw that it came quicker, I felt that
I had less chance than ever of getting anything out of him.
“Do you suppose it will still be years hence, Mr. Jaggers?”
Mr. Jaggers shook his head––not in negativing the question, but
in altogether negativing the notion that he could anyhow be got to
answer it––and the two horrible casts of the twitched faces looked,
when my eyes strayed up to them, as if they had come to a crisis in
their suspended attention, and were going to sneeze.
“Come!” said Mr. Jaggers, warming the backs of his legs with the
backs of his warmed hands, “I’ll be plain with you, my friend Pip.
That’s a question I must not be asked. You’ll understand that, better,
when I tell you it’s a question that might compromise me. Come! I’ll
go a little further with you; I’ll say something more.”
He bent down so low to frown at his boots, that he was able to rub
the calves of his legs in the pause he made.
“When that person discloses,” said Mr. Jaggers, straightening
himself, “you and that person will settle your own affairs. When that
person discloses, my part in this business will cease and determine.
When that person discloses, it will not be necessary for me to know
anything about it. And that’s all I have got to say.”
We looked at one another until I withdrew my eyes, and looked
thoughtfully at the floor. From this last speech I derived the notion
that Miss Havisham, for some reason or no reason, had not taken
him into her confidence as to her designing me for Estella; that he
resented this, and felt a jealousy about it; or that he really did object
to that scheme, and would have nothing to do with it. When I raised
264 Great Expectations
my eyes again, I found that he had been shrewdly looking at me all
the time, and was doing so still.
“If that is all you have to say, sir,” I remarked, “there can be
nothing left for me to say.”
He nodded assent, and pulled out his thief-dreaded watch, and
asked me where I was going to dine? I replied at my own chambers,
with Herbert. As a necessary sequence, I asked him if he would
favour us with his company, and he promptly accepted the invitation.
But he insisted on walking home with me, in order that I might make
no extra preparation for him, and first he had a letter or two to write,
and (of course) had his hands to wash. So, I said I would go into the
outer office and talk to Wemmick.
The fact was, that when the five hundred pounds had come into
my pocket, a thought had come into my head which had been often
there before; and it appeared to me that Wemmick was a good person
to advise with, concerning such thought.
He had already locked up his safe, and made preparations for
going home. He had left his desk, brought out his two greasy office
candlesticks and stood them in line with the snuffers on a slab near
the door, ready to be extinguished; he had raked his fire low, put his
hat and great-coat ready, and was beating himself all over the chest
with his safe-key, as an athletic exercise after business.
“Mr. Wemmick,” said I, “I want to ask your opinion. I am very
desirous to serve a friend.”
Wemmick tightened his post-office and shook his head, as if his
opinion were dead against any fatal weakness of that sort.
“This friend,” I pursued, “is trying to get on in commercial life,
but has no money, and finds it difficult and disheartening to make a
beginning. Now, I want somehow to help him to a beginning.”
“With money down?” said Wemmick, in a tone drier than any
sawdust.
“With some money down,” I replied, for an uneasy remembrance
shot across me of that symmetrical bundle of papers at home; “with
some money down, and perhaps some anticipation of my
expectations.”
“Mr. Pip,” said Wemmick, “I should like just to run over with you
on my fingers, if you please, the names of the various bridges up as
high as Chelsea Reach. Let’s see; there’s London, one; Southwark,*
two; Blackfriars, three; Waterloo, four; Westminster, five; Vauxhall,
xxxvi] Volume II Chapter XVII 265
six.” He had checked off each bridge in its turn, with the handle of
his safe-key on the palm of his hand. “There’s as many as six, you
see, to choose from.”
“I don’t understand you,” said I.
“Choose your bridge, Mr. Pip,” returned Wemmick, “and take a
walk upon your bridge, and pitch your money into the Thames over
the centre arch of your bridge, and you know the end of it. Serve a
friend with it, and you may know the end of it too––but it’s a less
pleasant and profitable end.”
I could have posted a newspaper in his mouth, he made it so wide
after saying this.
“This is very discouraging,” said I.
“Meant to be so,” said Wemmick.
“Then is it your opinion,” I inquired, with some little indignation, “that a man should never––––”
“––Invest portable property in a friend?” said Wemmick. “Certainly he should not. Unless he wants to get rid of the friend––and
then it becomes a question how much portable property it may be
worth to get rid of him.”
“And that,” said I, “is your deliberate opinion, Mr. Wemmick?”
“That,” he returned, “is my deliberate opinion in this office.”
“Ah!” said I, pressing him, for I thought I saw him near a loophole
here; “but would that be your opinion at Walworth?”
“Mr. Pip,” he replied, with gravity, “Walworth is one place, and
this office is another. Much as the Aged is one person, and Mr.
Jaggers is another. They must not be confounded together. My Walworth sentiments must be taken at Walworth; none but my official
sentiments can be taken in this office.”
“Very well,” said I, much relieved, “then I shall look you up at
Walworth, you may depend upon it.”
“Mr. Pip,” he returned, “you will be welcome there, in a private
and personal capacity.”
We had held this conversation in a low voice, well knowing my
guardian’s ears to be the sharpest of the sharp. As he now appeared
in his doorway, towelling his hands, Wemmick got on his great-coat
and stood by to snuff out the candles. We all three went into the
street together, and from the door-step Wemmick turned his way,
and Mr. Jaggers and I turned ours.
I could not help wishing more than once that evening, that Mr.
266 Great Expectations
Jaggers had had an Aged in Gerrard-street, or a Stinger, or a Something, or a Somebody, to unbend his brows a little. It was an
uncomfortable consideration on a twenty-first birthday, that coming
of age at all seemed hardly worth while in such a guarded and suspicious world as he made of it. He was a thousand times better
informed and cleverer than Wemmick, and yet I would a thousand
times rather have had Wemmick to dinner. And Mr. Jaggers made
not me alone intensely melancholy, because, after he was gone, Herbert said of himself, with his eyes fixed on the fire, that he thought he
must have committed a felony and forgotten the details of it, he felt
so dejected and guilty.
CHAPTER XVIII
Deeming Sunday the best day for taking Mr. Wemmick’s Walworth
sentiments, I devoted the next ensuing Sunday afternoon to a pilgrimage to the Castle. On arriving before the battlements, I found
the Union Jack flying and the drawbridge up; but undeterred by this
show of defiance and resistance, I rang at the gate, and was admitted
in a most pacific manner by the Aged.
“My son, sir,” said the old man, after securing the drawbridge,
“rather had it in his mind that you might happen to drop in, and he
left word that he would soon be home from his arternoon walk. He is
very regular in his walks, is my son. Very regular in everything, is my
son.”
I nodded at the old gentleman as Wemmick himself might have
nodded, and we went in and sat down by the fireside.
“You made acquaintance with my son, sir,” said the old man, in
his chirping way, while he warmed his hands at the blaze, “at his
office, I expect?” I nodded. “Hah! I have heerd that my son is a
wonderful hand at his business, sir?” I nodded hard. “Yes; so they
tell me. His business is the Law?” I nodded harder. “Which makes it
more surprising in my son,” said the old man, “for he was not
brought up to the Law, but to the Wine-Coopering.”
Curious to know how the old gentleman stood informed concerning the reputation of Mr. Jaggers, I roared that name at him. He
threw me into the greatest confusion by laughing heartily and replying in a very sprightly manner, “No, to be sure; you’re right.” And to
xxxvii] Volume II Chapter XVIII 267
this hour I have not the faintest notion what he meant, or what joke
he thought I had made.
As I could not sit there nodding at him perpetually, without making some other attempt to interest him, I shouted an inquiry whether
his own calling in life had been “the Wine-Coopering.” By dint of
straining that term out of myself several times and tapping the old
gentleman on the chest to associate it with him, I at last succeeded in
making my meaning understood.
“No,” said the old gentleman; “the warehousing, the warehousing.
First, over yonder;” he appeared to mean up the chimney, but I
believe he intended to refer me to Liverpool; “and then in the City of
London here. However, having an infirmity––for I am hard of hearing, sir––––”
I expressed in pantomime the greatest astonishment.
“––Yes, hard of hearing; having that infirmity coming upon me,
my son he went into the Law, and he took charge of me, and he by
little and little made out this elegant and beautiful property. But
returning to what you said, you know,” pursued the old man, again
laughing heartily, “what I say is, No to be sure; you’re right.”
I was modestly wondering whether my utmost ingenuity would
have enabled me to say anything that would have amused him half as
much as this imaginary pleasantry, when I was startled by a sudden
click in the wall on one side of the chimney, and the ghostly tumbling open of a little wooden flap with “John” upon it. The old man,
following my eyes, cried with triumph, “My son’s come home!” and
we both went out to the drawbridge.
It was worth any money to see Wemmick waving a salute to me
from the other side of the moat, when we might have shaken hands
across it with the greatest ease. The Aged was so delighted to work
the drawbridge, that I made no offer to assist him, but stood quiet
until Wemmick had come across, and had presented me to Miss
Skiffins: a lady by whom he was accompanied.
Miss Skiffins was of a wooden appearance, and was, like her
escort, in the post-office branch of the service. She might have been
some two or three years younger than Wemmick, and I judged her to
stand possessed of portable property. The cut of her dress from the
waist upward, both before and behind, made her figure very like a
boy’s kite; and I might have pronounced her gown a little too
decidedly orange, and her gloves a little too intensely green. But she
268 Great Expectations
seemed to be a good sort of fellow, and showed a high regard for the
Aged. I was not long in discovering that she was a frequent visitor at
the Castle; for, on our going in, and my complimenting Wemmick on
his ingenious contrivance for announcing himself to the Aged, he
begged me to give my attention for a moment to the other side of the
chimney, and disappeared. Presently another click came, and another
little door tumbled open with “Miss Skiffins” on it; then Miss Skiffins shut up and John tumbled open; then Miss Skiffins and John
both tumbled open together, and finally shut up together. On Wemmick’s return from working these mechanical appliances, I expressed
the great admiration with which I regarded them, and he said,
“Well, you know, they’re both pleasant and useful to the Aged. And
by George, sir, it’s a thing worth mentioning, that of all the people
who come to this gate, the secret of those pulls is only known to the
Aged, Miss Skiffins, and me!”
“And Mr. Wemmick made them,” added Miss Skiffins, “with his
own hands out of his own head.”
While Miss Skiffins was taking off her bonnet (she retained her
green gloves during the evening as an outward and visible sign that
there was company), Wemmick invited me to take a walk with him
round the property, and see how the island looked in winter-time.
Thinking that he did this to give me an opportunity of taking his
Walworth sentiments, I seized the opportunity as soon as we were
out of the Castle.
Having thought of the matter with care, I approached my subject
as if I had never hinted at it before. I informed Wemmick that I was
anxious on behalf of Herbert Pocket, and I told him how we had first
met, and how we had fought. I glanced at Herbert’s home, and at his
character, and at his having no means but such as he was dependent
on his father for: those, uncertain and unpunctual. I alluded to the
advantages I had derived in my first rawness and ignorance from his
society, and I confessed that I feared I had but ill repaid them, and
that he might have done better without me and my expectations.
Keeping Miss Havisham in the background at a great distance, I still
hinted at the possibility of my having competed with him in his
prospects, and at the certainty of his possessing a generous soul, and
being far above any mean distrusts, retaliations, or designs. For all
these reasons (I told Wemmick), and because he was my young companion and friend, and I had a great affection for him, I wished my
xxxvii] Volume II Chapter XVIII 269
own good fortune to reflect some rays upon him, and therefore I
sought advice from Wemmick’s experience and knowledge of men
and affairs, how I could best try with my resources to help Herbert
to some present income––say of a hundred a year, to keep him in
good hope and heart––and gradually to buy him on to some small
partnership. I begged Wemmick, in conclusion, to understand that
my help must always be rendered without Herbert’s knowledge or
suspicion, and that there was no one else in the world with whom I
could advise. I wound up by laying my hand upon his shoulder, and
saying, “I can’t help confiding in you, though I know it must be
troublesome to you; but that is your fault, in having ever brought me
here.”
Wemmick was silent for a little while, and then said with a kind of
start, “Well you know, Mr. Pip, I must tell you one thing. This is
devilish good of you.”
“Say you’ll help me to be good then,” said I.
“Ecod,” replied Wemmick, shaking his head, “that’s not my
trade.”
“Nor is this your trading-place,” said I.
“You are right,” he returned. “You hit the nail on the head. Mr
Pip, I’ll put on my considering-cap, and I think all you want to do,
may be done by degrees. Skiffins (that’s her brother) is an accountant and agent. I’ll look him up and go to work for you.”
“I thank you ten thousand times.”
“On the contrary,” said he, “I thank you, for though we are strictly
in our private and personal capacity, still it may be mentioned that
there are Newgate cobwebs about, and it brushes them away.”
After a little further conversation to the same effect, we returned
into the Castle where we found Miss Skiffins preparing tea. The
responsible duty of making the toast was delegated to the Aged, and
that excellent old gentleman was so intent upon it that he seemed to
me in some danger of melting his eyes. It was no nominal meal that
we were going to make, but a vigorous reality. The Aged prepared
such a haystack of buttered toast, that I could scarcely see him over it
as it simmered on an iron stand hooked on to the top-bar; while Miss
Skiffins brewed such a jorum* of tea, that the pig in the back premises became strongly excited, and repeatedly expressed his desire to
participate in the entertainment.
The flag had been struck, and the gun had been fired, at the right
270 Great Expectations
moment of time, and I felt as snugly cut off from the rest of Walworth as if the moat were thirty feet wide by as many deep. Nothing
disturbed the tranquillity of the Castle, but the occasional tumbling
open of John and Miss Skiffins: which little doors were a prey to
some spasmodic infirmity that made me sympathetically uncomfortable until I got used to it. I inferred from the methodical nature of
Miss Skiffins’s arrangements that she made tea there every Sunday
night; and I rather suspected that a classic brooch she wore, representing the profile of an undesirable female with a very straight nose
and a very new moon, was a piece of portable property that had been
given her by Wemmick.
We ate the whole of the toast, and drank tea in proportion, and it
was delightful to see how warm and greasy we all got after it. The
Aged especially, might have passed for some clean old chief of a
savage tribe, just oiled. After a short pause of repose, Miss Skiffins––
in the absence of the little servant who, it seemed, retired to the
bosom of her family on Sunday afternoons––washed up the teathings, in a trifling lady-like amateur manner that compromised
none of us. Then, she put on her gloves again, and we drew round
the fire, and Wemmick said, “Now Aged Parent, tip us the paper.”
Wemmick explained to me while the Aged got his spectacles out,
that this was according to custom, and that it gave the old gentleman
infinite satisfaction to read the news aloud. “I won’t offer an apology,” said Wemmick, “for he isn’t capable of many pleasures––are
you, Aged P.?”
“All right, John, all right,” returned the old man, seeing himself
spoken to.
“Only tip him a nod every now and then when he looks off his
paper,” said Wemmick, “and he’ll be as happy as a king. We are all
attention, Aged One.”
“All right, John, all right!” returned the cheerful old man: so busy
and so pleased, that it really was quite charming.
The Aged’s reading reminded me of the classes at Mr. Wopsle’s
great-aunt’s, with the pleasanter peculiarity that it seemed to come
through a keyhole. As he wanted the candles close to him, and as he
was always on the verge of putting either his head or the newspaper
into them, he required as much watching as a powder-mill.* But
Wemmick was equally untiring and gentle in his vigilance, and the
Aged read on, quite unconscious of his many rescues. Whenever he
xxxvii] Volume II Chapter XVIII 271
looked at us, we all expressed the greatest interest and amazement,
and nodded until he resumed again.
As Wemmick and Miss Skiffins sat side by side, and as I sat in a
shadowy corner, I observed a slow and gradual elongation of Mr.
Wemmick’s mouth, powerfully suggestive of his slowly and gradually stealing his arm round Miss Skiffins’s waist. In course of time I
saw his hand appear on the other side of Miss Skiffins; but at that
moment Miss Skiffins neatly stopped him with the green glove,
unwound his arm again as if it were an article of dress, and with the
greatest deliberation laid it on the table before her. Miss Skiffins’s
composure while she did this was one of the most remarkable sights I
have ever seen, and if I could have thought the act consistent with
abstraction of mind, I should have deemed that Miss Skiffins performed it mechanically.
By-and-by, I noticed Wemmick’s arm beginning to disappear
again, and gradually fading out of view. Shortly afterwards, his
mouth began to widen again. After an interval of suspense on my
part that was quite enthralling and almost painful, I saw his hand
appear on the other side of Miss Skiffins. Instantly Miss Skiffins
stopped it with the neatness of a placid boxer, took off that girdle or
cestus* as before, and laid it on the table. Taking the table to represent the path of virtue, I am justified in stating that during the whole
time of the Aged’s reading, Wemmick’s arm was straying from the
path of virtue and being recalled to it by Miss Skiffins.
At last, the Aged read himself into a light slumber. This was the
time for Wemmick to produce a little kettle, a tray of glasses, and a
black bottle with a porcelain-topped cork, representing some clerical
dignitary of a rubicund and social aspect. With the aid of these
appliances we all had something warm to drink: including the Aged,
who was soon awake again. Miss Skiffins mixed, and I observed that
she and Wemmick drank out of one glass. Of course I knew better
than to offer to see Miss Skiffins home, and under the circumstances
I thought I had best go first: which I did, taking a cordial leave of the
Aged, and having passed a pleasant evening.
Before a week was out, I received a note from Wemmick, dated
Walworth, stating that he hoped he had made some advance in that
matter appertaining to our private and personal capacities, and that
he would be glad if I could come and see him again upon it. So, I
went out to Walworth again, and yet again, and yet again, and I saw
272 Great Expectations
him by appointment in the City several times, but never held any
communication with him on the subject in or near Little Britain.
The upshot was, that we found a worthy young merchant or
shipping-broker, not long established in business, who wanted intelligent help, and who wanted capital, and who in due course of time
and receipt would want a partner. Between him and me, secret articles were signed of which Herbert was the subject, and I paid him
half of my five hundred pounds down, and engaged for sundry other
payments: some, to fall due at certain dates out of my income: some,
contingent on my coming into my property. Miss Skiffins’s brother
conducted the negotiation. Wemmick pervaded it throughout, but
never appeared in it.
The whole business was so cleverly managed, that Herbert had
not the least suspicion of my hand being in it. I never shall forget
the radiant face with which he came home one afternoon, and told
me, as a mighty piece of news, of his having fallen in with one
Clarriker (the young merchant’s name), and of Clarriker’s having
shown an extraordinary inclination towards him, and of his belief
that the opening had come at last. Day by day as his hopes grew
stronger and his face brighter, he must have thought me a more
and more affectionate friend, for I had the greatest difficulty in
restraining my tears of triumph when I saw him so happy. At
length, the thing being done, and he having that day entered
Clarriker’s House, and he having talked to me for a whole evening in
a flush of pleasure and success, I did really cry in good earnest when
I went to bed, to think that my expectations had done some good
to somebody.
A great event in my life, the turning point of my life, now opens
on my view. But, before I proceed to narrate it, and before I pass on
to all the changes it involved, I must give one chapter to Estella. It is
not much to give to the theme that so long filled my heart.
CHAPTER XIX
If that staid old house near the Green at Richmond should ever
come to be haunted when I am dead, it will be haunted, surely, by my
ghost. O the many, many nights and days through which the unquiet
spirit within me haunted that house when Estella lived there! Let my
xxxviii] Volume II Chapter XIX 273
body be where it would, my spirit was always wandering, wandering,
wandering, about that house.
The lady with whom Estella was placed, Mrs. Brandley by name,
was a widow, with one daughter several years older than Estella. The
mother looked young, and the daughter looked old; the mother’s
complexion was pink, and the daughter’s was yellow; the mother set
up for frivolity, and the daughter for theology. They were in what is
called a good position, and visited, and were visited by, numbers of
people. Little, if any, community of feeling subsisted between them
and Estella, but the understanding was established that they were
necessary to her, and that she was necessary to them. Mrs. Brandley
had been a friend of Miss Havisham’s before the time of her seclusion.
In Mrs. Brandley’s house and out of Mrs. Brandley’s house, I
suffered every kind and degree of torture that Estella could cause
me. The nature of my relations with her, which placed me on terms
of familiarity without placing me on terms of favour, conduced to
my distraction. She made use of me to tease other admirers, and she
turned the very familiarity between herself and me, to the account of
putting a constant slight on my devotion to her. If I had been her
secretary, steward, half-brother, poor relation––if I had been a
younger brother of her appointed husband––I could not have
seemed to myself, further from my hopes when I was nearest to her.
The privilege of calling her by her name and hearing her call me by
mine, became under the circumstances an aggravation of my trials;
and while I think it likely that it almost maddened her other lovers, I
know too certainly that it almost maddened me.
She had admirers without end. No doubt my jealousy made an
admirer of everyone who went near her; but there were more than
enough of them without that.
I saw her often at Richmond, I heard of her often in town, and I
used often to take her and the Brandleys on the water; there were
pic-nics, fête days, plays, operas, concerts, parties, all sorts of pleasures, through which I pursued her––and they were all miseries to
me. I never had one hour’s happiness in her society, and yet my mind
all round the four-and-twenty hours was harping on the happiness
of having her with me unto death.
Throughout this part of our intercourse––and it lasted, as will
presently be seen, for what I then thought a long time––she habitually reverted to that tone which expressed that our association was
274 Great Expectations
forced upon us. There were other times when she would come to a
sudden check in this tone and in all her many tones, and would seem
to pity me.
“Pip, Pip,” she said one evening, coming to such a check, when we
sat apart at a darkening window of the house in Richmond; “will you
never take warning?”
“Of what?”
“Of me.”
“Warning not to be attracted by you, do you mean, Estella?”
“Do I mean! If you don’t know what I mean, you are blind.”
I should have replied that Love was commonly reputed blind, but
for the reason that I always was restrained––and this was not the
least of my miseries––by a feeling that it was ungenerous to press
myself upon her, when she knew that she could not choose but obey
Miss Havisham. My dread always was, that this knowledge on her
part laid me under a heavy disadvantage with her pride, and made
me the subject of a rebellious struggle in her bosom.
“At any rate,” said I, “I have no warning given me just now, for
you wrote to me to come to you, this time.”
“That’s true,” said Estella, with a cold careless smile that always
chilled me.
After looking at the twilight without, for a little while, she went on
to say:
“The time has come round when Miss Havisham wishes to have
me for a day at Satis. You are to take me there, and bring me back, if
you will. She would rather I did not travel alone, and objects to
receiving my maid, for she has a sensitive horror of being talked of
by such people. Can you take me?”
“Can I take you, Estella!”
“You can then? The day after to-morrow, if you please. You are to
pay all charges out of my purse. You hear the condition of your
going?”
“And must obey,” said I.
This was all the preparation I received for that visit, or for others
like it: Miss Havisham never wrote to me, nor had I ever so much as
seen her handwriting. We went down on the next day but one, and
we found her in the room where I had first beheld her, and it is
needless to add that there was no change in Satis House.
She was even more dreadfully fond of Estella than she had been
xxxviii] Volume II Chapter XIX 275
when I last saw them together; I repeat the word advisedly, for there
was something positively dreadful in the energy of her looks and
embraces. She hung upon Estella’s beauty, hung upon her words,
hung upon her gestures, and sat mumbling her own trembling
fingers while she looked at her, as though she were devouring the
beautiful creature she had reared.
From Estella she looked at me, with a searching glance that
seemed to pry into my heart and probe its wounds. “How does she
use you, Pip; how does she use you?” she asked me again, with her
witch-like eagerness, even in Estella’s hearing. But, when we sat by
her flickering fire at night, she was most weird; for then, keeping
Estella’s hand drawn through her arm and clutched in her own hand,
she extorted from her, by dint of referring back to what Estella had
told her in her regular letters, the names and conditions of the men
whom she had fascinated; and as Miss Havisham dwelt upon this
roll, with the intensity of a mind mortally hurt and diseased, she sat
with her other hand on her crutch stick, and her chin on that, and
her wan bright eyes glaring at me, a very spectre.
I saw in this, wretched though it made me, and bitter the sense of
dependence and even of degradation that it awakened––I saw in this,
that Estella was set to wreak Miss Havisham’s revenge on men, and
that she was not to be given to me until she had gratified it for a
term. I saw in this, a reason for her being beforehand assigned to me.
Sending her out to attract and torment and do mischief, Miss Havisham sent her with the malicious assurance that she was beyond the
reach of all admirers, and that all who staked upon that cast were
secured to lose. I saw in this, that I, too, was tormented by a perversion of ingenuity, even while the prize was reserved for me. I saw in
this, the reason for my being staved off so long, and the reason for
my late guardian’s declining to commit himself to the formal knowledge of such a scheme. In a word, I saw in this, Miss Havisham as I
had her then and there before my eyes, and always had had her
before my eyes; and I saw in this, the distinct shadow of the darkened
and unhealthy house in which her life was hidden from the sun.
The candles that lighted that room of hers were placed in sconces
on the wall. They were high from the ground, and they burnt with
the steady dulness of artificial light in air that is seldom renewed. As
I looked round at them, and at the pale gloom they made, and at the
stopped clock, and at the withered articles of bridal dress upon the
276 Great Expectations
table and the ground, and at her own awful figure with its ghostly
reflection thrown large by the fire upon the ceiling and the wall, I
saw in everything the construction that my mind had come to,
repeated and thrown back to me. My thoughts passed into the great
room across the landing where the table was spread, and I saw it
written, as it were, in the falls of the cobwebs from the centre-piece,
in the crawlings of the spiders on the cloth, in the tracks of the mice
as they betook their little quickened hearts behind the panels, and in
the gropings and pausings of the beetles on the floor.
It happened on the occasion of this visit that some sharp words
arose between Estella and Miss Havisham. It was the first time I had
ever seen them opposed.
We were seated by the fire, as just now described, and Miss Havisham still had Estella’s arm drawn through her own, and still clutched
Estella’s hand in hers, when Estella gradually began to detach herself.
She had shown a proud impatience more than once before, and had
rather endured that fierce affection than accepted or returned it.
“What!” said Miss Havisham, flashing her eyes upon her, “are you
tired of me?”
“Only a little tired of myself,” replied Estella, disengaging her
arm, and moving to the great chimney-piece, where she stood looking down at the fire.
“Speak the truth, you ingrate!” cried Miss Havisham, passionately striking her stick upon the floor; “you are tired of me.”
Estella looked at her with perfect composure, and again looked
down at the fire. Her graceful figure and her beautiful face expressed
a self-possessed indifference to the wild heat of the other, that was
almost cruel.
“You stock and stone!” exclaimed Miss Havisham. “You cold, cold
heart!”
“What?” said Estella, preserving her attitude of indifference as
she leaned against the chimney-piece and only moving her eyes; “do
you reproach me for being cold? You?”
“Are you not?” was the fierce retort.
“You should know,” said Estella. “I am what you have made me.
Take all the praise, take all the blame; take all the success, take all the
failure; in short, take me.”
“O, look at her, look at her!” cried Miss Havisham, bitterly. “Look
at her, so hard and thankless, on the hearth where she was reared!
xxxviii] Volume II Chapter XIX 277
Where I took her into this wretched breast when it was first bleeding
from its stabs, and where I have lavished years of tenderness upon
her!”
“At least I was no party to the compact,” said Estella, “for if I
could walk and speak, when it was made, it was as much as I could
do. But what would you have? You have been very good to me, and I
owe everything to you. What would you have?”
“Love,” replied the other.
“You have it.”
“I have not,” said Miss Havisham.
“Mother by adoption,” retorted Estella, never departing from the
easy grace of her attitude, never raising her voice as the other did,
never yielding either to anger or tenderness, “Mother by adoption, I
have said that I owe everything to you. All I possess is freely yours.
All that you have given me, is at your command to have again.
Beyond that, I have nothing. And if you ask me to give you what you
never gave me, my gratitude and duty cannot do impossibilities.”
“Did I never give her, love!” cried Miss Havisham, turning wildly
to me. “Did I never give her a burning love, inseparable from jealousy at all times, and from sharp pain, while she speaks thus to me!
Let her call me mad, let her call me mad!”
“Why should I call you mad,” returned Estella, “I, of all people?
Does any one live, who knows what set purposes you have, half as
well as I do? Does any one live, who knows what a steady memory
you have, half as well as I do? I who have sat on this same hearth on
the little stool that is even now beside you there, learning your lessons and looking up into your face, when your face was strange and
frightened me!”
“Soon forgotten!” moaned Miss Havisham. “Times soon
forgotten!”
“No, not forgotten,” retorted Estella. “Not forgotten, but treasured
up in my memory. When have you found me false to your teaching?
When have you found me unmindful of your lessons? When have you
found me giving admission here,” she touched her bosom with her
hand, “to anything that you excluded? Be just to me.”
“So proud, so proud!” moaned Miss Havisham, pushing away her
grey hair with both her hands.
“Who taught me to be proud?” returned Estella. “Who praised
me when I learnt my lesson?”
278 Great Expectations
“So hard, so hard!” moaned Miss Havisham, with her former
action.
“Who taught me to be hard?” returned Estella. “Who praised me
when I learnt my lesson?”
“But to be proud and hard to me!” Miss Havisham quite shrieked,
as she stretched out her arms. “Estella, Estella, Estella, to be proud
and hard to me!”
Estella looked at her for a moment with a kind of calm wonder, but
was not otherwise disturbed; when the moment was past, she looked
down at the fire again.
“I cannot think,” said Estella, raising her eyes after a silence, “why
you should be so unreasonable when I come to see you after a separation. I have never forgotten your wrongs and their causes. I have
never been unfaithful to you or your schooling. I have never shown
any weakness that I can charge myself with.”
“Would it be weakness to return my love?” exclaimed Miss Havisham. “But yes, yes, she would call it so!”
“I begin to think,” said Estella, in a musing way, after another
moment of calm wonder, “that I almost understand how this comes
about. If you had brought up your adopted daughter wholly in the
dark confinement of these rooms, and had never let her know that
there was such a thing as the daylight by which she has never once
seen your face––if you had done that, and then, for a purpose had
wanted her to understand the daylight and know all about it, you
would have been disappointed and angry?”
Miss Havisham, with her head in her hands, sat making a low
moaning, and swaying herself on her chair, but gave no answer.
“Or,” said Estella, “––which is nearer a case––if you had taught her,
from the dawn of her intelligence, with your utmost energy and might,
that there was such a thing as daylight, but that it was made to be her
enemy and destroyer, and she must always turn against it, for it had
blighted you and would else blight her;–– if you had done this, and
then, for a purpose, had wanted her to take naturally to the daylight and
she could not do it, you would have been disappointed and angry?”
Miss Havisham sat listening (or it seemed so, for I could not see
her face), but still made no answer.
“So,” said Estella, “I must be taken as I have been made. The
success is not mine, the failure is not mine, but the two together
make me.”
xxxviii] Volume II Chapter XIX 279
Miss Havisham had settled down, I hardly knew how, upon the
floor, among the faded bridal relics with which it was strewn. I took
advantage of the moment––I had sought one from the first––to leave
the room, after beseeching Estella’s attention to her, with a movement of my hand. When I left, Estella was yet standing by the great
chimney-piece, just as she had stood throughout. Miss Havisham’s
grey hair was all adrift upon the ground, among the other bridal
wrecks, and was a miserable sight to see.
It was with a depressed heart that I walked in the starlight for an
hour and more, about the court-yard, and about the brewery, and
about the ruined garden. When I at last took courage to return to the
room, I found Estella sitting at Miss Havisham’s knee, taking up
some stitches in one of those old articles of dress that were dropping
to pieces, and of which I have often been reminded since by the
faded tatters of old banners that I have seen hanging up in cathedrals. Afterwards, Estella and I played cards, as of yore––only we
were skilful now, and played French games––and so the evening
wore away, and I went to bed.
I lay in that separate building across the court-yard. It was the first
time I had ever lain down to rest in Satis House, and sleep refused to
come near me. A thousand Miss Havishams haunted me. She was on
this side of my pillow, on that, at the head of the bed, at the foot,
behind the half-opened door of the dressing-room, in the dressingroom, in the room overhead, in the room beneath––everywhere. At
last, when the night was slow to creep on towards two o’clock, I felt
that I absolutely could no longer bear the place as a place to lie down
in, and that I must get up. I therefore got up and put on my clothes,
and went out across the yard into the long stone passage, designing
to gain the outer court-yard and walk there for the relief of my mind.
But, I was no sooner in the passage than I extinguished my candle;
for, I saw Miss Havisham going along it in a ghostly manner, making
a low cry. I followed her at a distance, and saw her go up the staircase.
She carried a bare candle in her hand, which she had probably taken
from one of the sconces in her own room, and was a most unearthly
object by its light. Standing at the bottom of the staircase, I felt the
mildewed air of the feast-chamber, without seeing her open the door,
and I heard her walking there, and so across into her own room, and
so across again into that, never ceasing the low cry. After a time, I
tried in the dark both to get out, and to go back, but I could do
280 Great Expectations
neither until some streaks of day strayed in and showed me where to
lay my hands. During the whole interval, whenever I went to the
bottom of the staircase, I heard her footstep, saw her light pass above,
and heard her ceaseless low cry.
Before we left next day, there was no revival of the difference
between her and Estella, nor was it ever revived on any similar occasion; and there were four similar occasions, to the best of my
remembrance. Nor, did Miss Havisham’s manner towards Estella in
anywise change, except that I believed it to have something like fear
infused among its former characteristics.
It is impossible to turn this leaf of my life, without putting Bentley Drummle’s name upon it; or I would, very gladly.
On a certain occasion when the Finches were assembled in force,
and when good feeling was being promoted in the usual manner by
nobody’s agreeing with anybody else, the presiding Finch called the
Grove to order, forasmuch as Mr. Drummle had not yet toasted a
lady; which, according to the solemn constitution of the society, it
was the brute’s turn to do that day. I thought I saw him leer in an
ugly way at me while the decanters were going round, but as there
was no love lost between us, that might easily be. What was my
indignant surprise when he called upon the company to pledge him
to “Estella!”
“Estella who?” said I.
“Never you mind,” retorted Drummle.
“Estella of where?” said I. “You are bound to say of where.”
Which he was, as a Finch.
“Of Richmond, gentlemen,” said Drummle, putting me out of the
question, “and a peerless beauty.”
Much he knew about peerless beauties, a mean miserable idiot! I
whispered Herbert.
“I know that lady,” said Herbert across the table, when the toast
had been honoured.
“Do you?” said Drummle.
“And so do I,” I added, with a scarlet face.
“Do you?” said Drummle. “Oh, Lord!”
This was the only retort––except glass or crockery––that the
heavy creature was capable of making; but, I became as highly
incensed by it as if it had been barbed with wit, and I immediately
rose in my place and said that I could not but regard it as being like
xxxviii] Volume II Chapter XIX 281
the honourable Finch’s impudence to come down to that Grove––we
always talked about coming down to that Grove, as a neat Parliamentary turn of expression*––down to that Grove, proposing a lady
of whom he knew nothing. Mr. Drummle upon this, starting up,
demanded what I meant by that? Whereupon, I made him the
extreme reply that I believed he knew where I was to be found.*
Whether it was possible in a Christian country to get on without
blood, after this, was a question on which the Finches were divided.
The debate upon it grew so lively, indeed, that at least six more
honourable members told six more, during the discussion, that they
believed they knew where they were to be found. However, it was
decided at last (the Grove being a Court of Honour) that if Mr.
Drummle would bring never so slight a certificate from the lady,
importing that he had the honour of her acquaintance, Mr. Pip must
express his regret, as a gentleman and a Finch, for “having been
betrayed into a warmth which.” Next day was appointed for the
production (lest our honour should take cold from delay), and the
next day Drummle appeared with a polite little avowal in Estella’s
hand, that she had had the honour of dancing with him several
times. This left me no course but to regret that I had been “betrayed
into a warmth which,” and on the whole to repudiate, as untenable,
the idea that I was to be found anywhere. Drummle and I then sat
snorting at one another for an hour, while the Grove engaged in
indiscriminate contradiction, and finally the promotion of good feeling was declared to have gone ahead at an amazing rate.
I tell this lightly, but it was no light thing to me. For, I cannot
adequately express what pain it gave me to think that Estella should
show any favour to a contemptible, clumsy, sulky booby, so very far
below the average. To the present moment, I believe it to have been
referable to some pure fire of generosity and disinterestedness in my
love for her, that I could not endure the thought of her stooping to
that hound. No doubt I should have been miserable whomsoever she
had favoured; but a worthier object would have caused me a different
kind and degree of distress.
It was easy for me to find out, and I did soon find out, that
Drummle had begun to follow her closely, and that she allowed him
to do it. A little while, and he was always in pursuit of her, and he and
I crossed one another every day. He held on, in a dull persistent way,
and Estella held him on; now with encouragement, now with dis282 Great Expectations
couragement, now almost flattering him, now openly despising him,
now knowing him very well, now scarcely remembering who he was.
The Spider, as Mr. Jaggers had called him, was used to lying in
wait, however, and had the patience of his tribe. Added to that, he
had a blockhead confidence in his money and in his family greatness,
which sometimes did him good service––almost taking the place of
concentration and determined purpose. So, the Spider, doggedly
watching Estella, outwatched many brighter insects, and would often
uncoil himself and drop at the right nick of time.
At a certain Assembly Ball* at Richmond (there used to be
Assembly Balls at most places then), where Estella had outshone all
other beauties, this blundering Drummle so hung about her, and
with so much toleration on her part, that I resolved to speak to her
concerning him. I took the next opportunity; which was when she
was waiting for Mrs. Brandley to take her home, and was sitting
apart among some flowers, ready to go. I was with her, for I almost
always accompanied them to and from such places.
“Are you tired, Estella?”
“Rather, Pip.”
“You should be.”
“Say rather, I should not be; for I have my letter to Satis House to
write, before I go to sleep.”
“Recounting to-night’s triumph?” said I. “Surely a very poor one,
Estella.”
“What do you mean? I didn’t know there had been any.”
“Estella,” said I, “do look at that fellow in the corner yonder, who
is looking over here at us.”
“Why should I look at him?” returned Estella, with her eyes on
me instead. “What is there in that fellow in the corner yonder––to
use your words––that I need look at?”
“Indeed, that is the very question I want to ask you,” said I. “For
he has been hovering about you all night.”
“Moths, and all sorts of ugly creatures,” replied Estella, with a
glance towards him, “hover about a lighted candle. Can the candle
help it?”
“No,” I returned; “but cannot the Estella help it?”
“Well!” said she, laughing, after a moment, “perhaps. Yes. Anything you like.”
“But, Estella, do hear me speak. It makes me wretched that you
xxxviii] Volume II Chapter XIX 283
should encourage a man so generally despised as Drummle. You
know he is despised.”
“Well?” said she.
“You know he is as ungainly within, as without. A deficient, illtempered, lowering, stupid fellow.”
“Well?” said she.
“You know he has nothing to recommend him but money, and a
ridiculous roll of addle-headed predecessors; now, don’t you?”
“Well?” said she again; and each time she said it, she opened her
lovely eyes the wider.
To overcome the difficulty of getting past that monosyllable, I
took it from her, and said, repeating it with emphasis, “Well! Then,
that is why it makes me wretched.”
Now, if I could have believed that she favoured Drummle with any
idea of making me––me––wretched, I should have been in better
heart about it; but in that habitual way of hers, she put me so entirely
out of the question, that I could believe nothing of the kind.
“Pip,” said Estella, casting her glance over the room, “don’t be
foolish about its effect on you. It may have its effect on others, and
may be meant to have. It’s not worth discussing.”
“Yes it is,” said I, “because I cannot bear that people should say,
‘she throws away her graces and attractions on a mere boor, the
lowest in the crowd.’ ”
“I can bear it,” said Estella.
“Oh! don’t be so proud, Estella, and so inflexible.”
“Calls me proud and inflexible in this breath!” said Estella, opening her hands. “And in his last breath reproached me for stooping to
a boor!”
“There is no doubt you do,” said I, something hurriedly, “for I
have seen you give him looks and smiles this very night, such as you
never give to––me.”
“Do you want me then,” said Estella, turning suddenly with a
fixed and serious, if not angry, look, “to deceive and entrap you?”
“Do you deceive and entrap him, Estella?”
“Yes, and many others––all of them but you. Here is Mrs.
Brandley. I’ll say no more.”
And now that I have given the one chapter to the theme that so
filled my heart, and so often made it ache and ache again, I pass
284 Great Expectations
on, unhindered, to the event that had impended over me longer
yet; the event that had begun to be prepared for, before I knew that
the world held Estella, and in the days when her baby intelligence
was receiving its first distortions from Miss Havisham’s wasting
hands.
In the Eastern story,* the heavy slab that was to fall on the bed of
state in the flush of conquest was slowly wrought out of the quarry,
the tunnel for the rope to hold it in its place was slowly carried
through the leagues of rock, the slab was slowly raised and fitted in
the roof, the rope was rove to it and slowly taken through the miles of
hollow to the great iron ring. All being made ready with much
labour, and the hour come, the sultan was aroused in the dead of
the night, and the sharpened axe that was to sever the rope from the
great iron ring was put into his hand, and he struck with it, and
the rope parted and rushed away, and the ceiling fell. So, in my case;
all the work, near and afar, that tended to the end, had been accomplished; and in an instant the blow was struck, and the roof of my
stronghold dropped upon me.
CHAPTER XX
I was three-and-twenty years of age. Not another word had I heard
to enlighten me on the subject of my expectations, and my twentythird birthday was a week gone. We had left Barnard’s Inn more than
a year and lived in the Temple.* Our chambers were in Gardencourt, down by the river.
Mr. Pocket and I had for some time parted company as to our
original relations, though we continued on the best terms. Notwithstanding my inability to settle to anything––which I hope arose out
of the restless and incomplete tenure on which I held my means––I
had a taste for reading, and read regularly so many hours a day. That
matter of Herbert’s was still progressing, and everything with me
was as I have brought it down to the close of the last chapter.
Business had taken Herbert on a journey to Marseilles. I was
alone, and had a dull sense of being alone. Dispirited and anxious,
long hoping that to-morrow or next week would clear my way, and
long disappointed, I sadly missed the cheerful face and ready
response of my friend.
xxxix] Volume II Chapter XX 285
It was wretched weather; stormy and wet, stormy and wet; and
mud, mud, mud,* deep in all the streets. Day after day, a vast heavy
veil had been driving over London from the East, and it drove still,
as if in the East there were an Eternity of cloud and wind. So furious
had been the gusts, that high buildings in town had had the lead
stripped off their roofs; and in the country, trees had been torn up,
and sails of windmills carried away; and gloomy accounts had come
in from the coast, of shipwreck and death. Violent blasts of rain had
accompanied these rages of wind, and the day just closed as I sat
down to read had been the worst of all.
Alterations* have been made in that part of the Temple since that
time, and it has not now so lonely a character as it had then, nor is it
so exposed to the river. We lived at the top of the last house, and the
wind rushing up the river shook the house that night, like discharges
of cannon, or breakings of a sea. When the rain came with it and
dashed against the windows, I thought, raising my eyes to them as
they rocked, that I might have fancied myself in a storm-beaten
lighthouse. Occasionally, the smoke came rolling down the chimney
as though it could not bear to go out into such a night; and when I set
the doors open and looked down the staircase, the staircase lamps
were blown out; and when I shaded my face with my hands and
looked through the black windows (opening them ever so little, was
out of the question in the teeth of such wind and rain) I saw that the
lamps in the court were blown out, and that the lamps on the bridges
and the shore were shuddering and that the coal fires in barges on the
river were being carried away before the wind like red-hot splashes
in the rain.
I read with my watch upon the table, proposing to close my book
at eleven o’clock. As I shut it, Saint Paul’s, and all the many churchclocks in the City––some leading, some accompanying, some
following––struck that hour. The sound was curiously flawed by the
wind; and I was listening, and thinking how the wind assailed and
tore it, when I heard a footstep on the stair.
What nervous folly made me start, and awfully connect it with the
footstep of my dead sister, matters not. It was past in a moment, and
I listened again, and heard the footstep stumble in coming on.
Remembering then, that the staircase-lights were blown out, I took
up my reading-lamp and went out to the stair-head. Whoever was
below had stopped on seeing my lamp, for all was quiet.
286 Great Expectations
“There is some one down there, is there not?” I called out, looking
down.
“Yes,” said a voice from the darkness beneath.
“What floor do you want?”
“The top. Mr. Pip.”
“That is my name.––There is nothing the matter?”
“Nothing the matter,” returned the voice. And the man came on.
I stood with my lamp held out over the stair-rail, and he came
slowly within its light. It was a shaded lamp, to shine upon a book,
and its circle of light was very contracted; so that he was in it for a
mere instant, and then out of it. In the instant, I had seen a face that
was strange to me, looking up with an incomprehensible air of being
touched and pleased by the sight of me.
Moving the lamp as the man moved, I made out that he was
substantially dressed, but roughly; like a voyager by sea. That he
had long iron grey hair. That his age was about sixty. That he was
a muscular man, strong on his legs, and that he was browned and
hardened by exposure to weather. As he ascended the last stair or
two, and the light of my lamp included us both, I saw, with a
stupid kind of amazement, that he was holding out both his hands
to me.
“Pray what is your business?” I asked him.
“My business?” he repeated, pausing. “Ah! Yes. I will explain my
business, by your leave.”
“Do you wish to come in?”
“Yes,” he replied; “I wish to come in, Master.”
I had asked him the question inhospitably enough, for I resented
the sort of bright and gratified recognition that still shone in his face.
I resented it, because it seemed to imply that he expected me to
respond to it. But, I took him into the room I had just left, and,
having set the lamp on the table, asked him as civilly as I could, to
explain himself.
He looked about him with the strangest air––an air of wondering
pleasure, as if he had some part in the things he admired––and he
pulled off a rough outer coat, and his hat. Then, I saw that his head
was furrowed and bald, and that the long iron grey hair grew only on
its sides. But, I saw nothing that in the least explained him. On the
contrary, I saw him next moment, once more holding out both his
hands to me.
xxxix] Volume II Chapter XX 287
“What do you mean?” said I, half suspecting him to be mad.
He stopped in his looking at me, and slowly rubbed his right hand
over his head. “It’s disapinting to a man,” he said, in a coarse broken
voice, “arter having looked for’ard so distant, and come so fur; but
you’re not to blame for that––neither on us is to blame for that. I’ll
speak in half a minute. Give me half a minute, please.”
He sat down on a chair that stood before the fire, and covered his
forehead with his large brown veinous hands. I looked at him
attentively then, and recoiled a little from him; but I did not know
him.
“There’s no one nigh,” said he, looking over his shoulder, “is
there?”
“Why do you, a stranger coming into my rooms at this time of
night, ask that question?” said I.
“You’re a game one,” he returned, shaking his head at me with a
deliberate affection, at once most unintelligible and most exasperating; “I’m glad you’ve grow’d up, a game one! But don’t catch hold of
me. You’d be sorry arterwards to have done it.”
I relinquished the intention he had detected, for I knew him! Even
yet, I could not recal a single feature, but I knew him! If the wind and
the rain had driven away the intervening years, had scattered all the
intervening objects, had swept us to the churchyard where we first
stood face to face on such different levels, I could not have known my
convict more distinctly than I knew him now, as he sat in the chair
before the fire. No need to take a file from his pocket and show it to
me; no need to take the handkerchief from his neck and twist it
round his head; no need to hug himself with both his arms, and take
a shivering turn across the room, looking back at me for recognition.
I knew him before he gave me one of those aids, though, a moment
before, I had not been conscious of remotely suspecting his identity.
He came back to where I stood, and again held out both his hands.
Not knowing what to do––for, in my astonishment I had lost my selfpossession––I reluctantly gave him my hands. He grasped them
heartily, raised them to his lips, kissed them, and still held them.
“You acted noble, my boy,” said he. “Noble, Pip! And I have never
forgot it!”
At a change in his manner as if he were even going to embrace me,
I laid a hand upon his breast and put him away.
“Stay!” said I. “Keep off! If you are grateful to me for what I did
288 Great Expectations
when I was a little child, I hope you have shown your gratitude by
mending your way of life. If you have come here to thank me, it was
not necessary. Still, however you have found me out, there must be
something good in the feeling that has brought you here, and I will
not repulse you; but surely you must understand that––I––––”
My attention was so attracted by the singularity of his fixed look
at me, that the words died away on my tongue.
“You was a saying,” he observed, when we had confronted one
another in silence, “that surely I must understand. What, surely
must I understand?”
“That I cannot wish to renew that chance intercourse with you of
long ago, under these different circumstances. I am glad to believe
you have repented and recovered yourself. I am glad to tell you so. I
am glad that, thinking I deserve to be thanked, you have come to
thank me. But our ways are different ways, none the less. You are
wet, and you look weary. Will you drink something before you go?”
He had replaced his neckerchief loosely, and had stood, keenly
observant of me, biting a long end of it. “I think,” he answered, still
with the end at his mouth and still observant of me, “that I will drink
(I thank you) afore I go.”
There was a tray ready on a side-table. I brought it to the table
near the fire, and asked him what he would have? He touched one of
the bottles without looking at it or speaking, and I made him some
hot rum-and-water. I tried to keep my hand steady while I did so, but
his look at me as he leaned back in his chair with the long draggled
end of his neckerchief between his teeth––evidently forgotten––
made my hand very difficult to master. When at last I put the glass to
him, I saw with amazement that his eyes were full of tears.
Up to this time I had remained standing, not to disguise that I
wished him gone. But I was softened by the softened aspect of the
man, and felt a touch of reproach. “I hope,” said I, hurriedly putting
something into a glass for myself, and drawing a chair to the table,
“that you will not think I spoke harshly to you just now. I had no
intention of doing it, and I am sorry for it if I did. I wish you well,
and happy!”
As I put my glass to my lips, he glanced with surprise at the end of
his neckerchief, dropping from his mouth when he opened it, and
stretched out his hand. I gave him mine, and then he drank, and
drew his sleeve across his eyes and forehead.
xxxix] Volume II Chapter XX 289
“How are you living?” I asked him.
“I’ve been a sheep-farmer, stock-breeder, other trades besides,
away in the new world,” said he: “many a thousand mile of stormy
water off from this.”
“I hope you have done well?”
“I’ve done wonderful well. There’s others went out alonger me as
has done well too, but no man has done nigh as well as me. I’m
famous for it.”*
“I am glad to hear it.”
“I hope to hear you say so, my dear boy.”
Without stopping to try to understand those words or the tone in
which they were spoken, I turned off to a point that had just come
into my mind.
“Have you ever seen a messenger you once sent to me,” I inquired,
“since he undertook that trust?”
“Never set eyes upon him. I warn’t likely to it.”
“He came faithfully, and he brought me the two one-pound notes.
I was a poor boy then, as you know, and to a poor boy they were a
little fortune. But, like you, I have done well since, and you must let
me pay them back. You can put them to some other poor boy’s use.”
I took out my purse.
He watched me as I laid my purse upon the table and opened it,
and he watched me as I separated two one-pound notes from its
contents. They were clean and new, and I spread them out and
handed them over to him. Still watching me, he laid them one upon
the other, folded them long-wise, gave them a twist, set fire to them
at the lamp, and dropped the ashes into the tray.
“May I make so bold,” he said then, with a smile that was like a
frown, and with a frown that was like a smile, “as ask you how you
have done well, since you and me was out on them lone shivering
marshes?”
“How?”
“Ah!”
He emptied his glass, got up, and stood at the side of the fire, with
his heavy brown hand on the mantelshelf. He put a foot up to the
bars, to dry and warm it, and the wet boot began to steam; but, he
neither looked at it, nor at the fire, but steadily looked at me. It was
only now that I began to tremble.
When my lips had parted, and had shaped some words that were
290 Great Expectations
without sound, I forced myself to tell him (though I could not do it
distinctly), that I had been chosen to succeed to some property.
“Might a mere warmint ask what property?” said he.
I faltered, “I don’t know.”
“Might a mere warmint ask whose property?” said he.
I faltered again, “I don’t know.”
“Could I make a guess, I wonder,” said the Convict, “at your
income since you come of age! As to the first figure now. Five?”
With my heart beating like a heavy hammer of disordered action, I
rose out of my chair, and stood with my hand upon the back of it,
looking wildly at him.
“Concerning a guardian,” he went on. “There ought to have been
some guardian, or such-like, whiles you was a minor. Some lawyer,
maybe. As to the first letter of that lawyer’s name now. Would it
be J?”
All the truth of my position came flashing on me; and its disappointments, dangers, disgraces, consequences of all kinds, rushed in
in such a multitude that I was borne down by them and had to
struggle for every breath I drew.
“Put it,” he resumed, “as the employer of that lawyer whose name
begun with a J, and might be Jaggers––put it as he had come over sea
to Portsmouth, and had landed there, and had wanted to come to
you. ‘However you have found me out,’ you says just now. Well!
However did I find you out? Why, I wrote from Portsmouth to a
person in London, for particulars of your address. That person’s
name? Why, Wemmick.”
I could not have spoken one word, though it had been to save my
life. I stood, with a hand on the chair-back and a hand on my breast,
where I seemed to be suffocating––I stood so, looking wildly at him,
until I grasped at the chair, when the room began to surge and turn.
He caught me, drew me to the sofa, put me up against the cushions,
and bent on one knee before me: bringing the face that I now well
remembered, and that I shuddered at, very near to mine.
“Yes, Pip, dear boy, I’ve made a gentleman on you! It’s me wot has
done it! I swore that time, sure as ever I earned a guinea, that guinea
should go to you. I swore arterwards, sure as ever I spec’lated and got
rich, you should get rich. I lived rough, that you should live smooth; I
worked hard, that you should be above work. What odds, dear boy?
Do I tell it, fur you to feel a obligation? Not a bit. I tell it, fur you to
xxxix] Volume II Chapter XX 291
know as that there hunted dunghill dog wot you kep life in, got his
head so high that he could make a gentleman––and, Pip, you’re him!”
The abhorrence in which I held the man, the dread I had of him,
the repugnance with which I shrank from him, could not have been
exceeded if he had been some terrible beast.
“Look’ee here, Pip. I’m your second father. You’re my son––more
to me nor any son. I’ve put away money, only for you to spend.
When I was a hired-out shepherd in a solitary hut, not seeing no
faces but faces of sheep till I half forgot wot men’s and women’s
faces wos like, I see yourn. I drops my knife many a time in that hut
when I was a eating my dinner or my supper, and I says, ‘Here’s the
boy again, a looking at me whiles I eats and drinks!’ I see you there a
many times, as plain as ever I see you on them misty marshes. ‘Lord
strike me dead!’ I says each time––and I goes out in the air to say it
under the open heavens––‘but wot, if I gets liberty and money, I’ll
make that boy a gentleman!’ And I done it. Why, look at you, dear
boy! Look at these here lodgings o’ yourn, fit for a lord! A lord? Ah!
You shall show money with lords for wagers, and beat ’em!”
In his heat and triumph, and in his knowledge that I had been
nearly fainting, he did not remark on my reception of all this. It was
the one grain of relief I had.
“Look’ee here!” he went on, taking my watch out of my pocket,
and turning towards him a ring on my finger, while I recoiled from
his touch as if he had been a snake, “a gold ’un and a beauty: that’s a
gentleman’s, I hope! A diamond all set round with rubies; that’s
a gentleman’s, I hope! Look at your linen; fine and beautiful! Look at
your clothes; better ain’t to be got! And your books too,” turning his
eyes round the room, “mounting up on their shelves, by hundreds!
And you read ’em, don’t you? I see you’d been a reading of ’em when
I come in. Ha, ha, ha! You shall read ’em to me, dear boy! And if
they’re in foreign languages wot I don’t understand, I shall be just as
proud as if I did.”
Again he took both my hands and put them to his lips, while my
blood ran cold within me.
“Don’t you mind talking, Pip,” said he, after again drawing his
sleeve over his eyes and forehead, as the click came in his throat
which I well remembered––and he was all the more horrible to me
that he was so much in earnest; “you can’t do better nor keep quiet,
dear boy. You ain’t looked slowly forward to this as I have; you wosn’t
292 Great Expectations
prepared for this, as I wos. But didn’t you never think it might be
me?”
“O no, no, no,” I returned. “Never, never!”
“Well, you see it wos me, and single-handed. Never a soul in it but
my own self and Mr. Jaggers.”
“Was there no one else?” I asked.
“No,” said he, with a glance of surprise: “who else should there
be? And, dear boy, how good-looking you have growed! There’s
bright eyes somewheres––eh? Isn’t there bright eyes somewheres,
wot you love the thoughts on?”
O Estella, Estella!
“They shall be yourn, dear boy, if money can buy ’em. Not that a
gentleman like you, so well set up as you, can’t win ’em off of his
own game; but money shall back you! Let me finish wot I was a
telling you, dear boy. From that there hut and that there hiring-out, I
got money left me by my master (which died, and had been the same
as me), and got my liberty and went for myself. In every single thing
I went for, I went for you. ‘Lord strike a blight upon it,’ I says,
wotever it was I went for, ‘if it ain’t for him!’ It all prospered wonderful. As I giv’ you to understand just now, I’m famous for it. It was the
money left me, and the gains of the first few years wot I sent home to
Mr. Jaggers––all for you––when he first come arter you, agreeable to
my letter.”
O, that he had never come! That he had left me at the forge––far
from contented, yet, by comparison, happy!
“And then, dear boy, it was a recompense to me, look’ee here, to
know in secret that I was making a gentleman. The blood horses of
them colonists might fling up the dust over me as I was walking;
what do I say? I says to myself, ‘I’m making a better gentleman nor
ever you’ll be!’ When one of ’em says to another, ‘He was a convict, a
few year ago, and is a ignorant common fellow now, for all he’s
lucky,’ what do I say? I says to myself, ‘If I ain’t a gentleman, nor yet
ain’t got no learning, I’m the owner of such. All on you owns stock
and land; which on you owns a brought-up London gentleman?’
This way I kep myself a going. And this way I held steady afore my
mind that I would for certain come one day and see my boy, and
make myself known to him, on his own ground.”
He laid his hand on my shoulder. I shuddered at the thought that
for anything I knew, his hand might be stained with blood.
xxxix] Volume II Chapter XX 293
“It warn’t easy, Pip, for me to leave them parts, nor yet it warn’t
safe.* But I held to it, and the harder it was, the stronger I held, for I
was determined, and my mind firm made up. At last I done it. Dear
boy, I done it!”
I tried to collect my thoughts, but I was stunned. Throughout, I
had seemed to myself to attend more to the wind and the rain than to
him; even now, I could not separate his voice from those voices,
though those were loud and his was silent.
“Where will you put me?” he asked presently. “I must be put
somewheres, dear boy.”
“To sleep?” said I.
“Yes. And to sleep long and sound,” he answered; “for I’ve been
sea-tossed and sea-washed, months and months.”
“My friend and companion,” said I, rising from the sofa, “is
absent; you must have his room.”
“He won’t come back to-morrow; will he?”
“No,” said I, answering almost mechanically, in spite of my
utmost efforts; “not to-morrow.”
“Because, look’ee here, dear boy,” he said, dropping his voice, and
laying a long finger on my breast in an impressive manner, “caution
is necessary.”
“How do you mean? Caution?”
“By G––, it’s Death!”
“What’s death?”
“I was sent for life. It’s death to come back. There’s been overmuch coming back of late years, and I should of a certainty be
hanged if took.”
Nothing was needed but this; the wretched man, after loading
wretched me with his gold and silver chains for years, had risked his
life to come to me, and I held it there in my keeping! If I had loved
him instead of abhorring him; if I had been attracted to him by the
strongest admiration and affection, instead of shrinking from him
with strongest repugnance; it could have been no worse. On the
contrary, it would have been better, for his preservation would then
have naturally and tenderly addressed my heart.
My first care was to close the shutters, so that no light might be
seen from without, and then to close and make fast the doors. While
I did so, he stood at the table drinking rum and eating biscuit; and
when I saw him thus engaged, I saw my convict on the marshes at
294 Great Expectations
his meal again. It almost seemed to me as if he must stoop down
presently, to file at his leg.
When I had gone into Herbert’s room, and had shut off any other
communication between it and the staircase than through the room
in which our conversation had been held, I asked him if he would go
to bed? He said yes, but asked me for some of my “gentleman’s
linen” to put on in the morning. I brought it out, and laid it ready for
him, and my blood again ran cold when he again took me by both
hands to give me good night.
I got away from him, without knowing how I did it, and mended
the fire in the room where we had been together, and sat down by it,
afraid to go to bed. For an hour or more, I remained too stunned to
think; and it was not until I began to think, that I began fully to
know how wrecked I was, and how the ship in which I had sailed was
gone to pieces.
Miss Havisham’s intentions towards me, all a mere dream; Estella
not designed for me; I only suffered in Satis House as a convenience,
a sting for the greedy relations, a model with a mechanical heart to
practise on when no other practice was at hand; those were the first
smarts I had. But, sharpest and deepest pain of all––it was for the
convict, guilty of I knew not what crimes, and liable to be taken out
of those rooms where I sat thinking, and hanged at the Old Bailey
door, that I had deserted Joe.
I would not have gone back to Joe now, I would not have gone back
to Biddy now, for any consideration; simply, I suppose, because my
sense of my own worthless conduct to them was greater than every
consideration. No wisdom on earth could have given me the comfort
that I should have derived from their simplicity and fidelity; but I
could never, never, never, undo what I had done.
In every rage of wind and rush of rain, I heard pursuers. Twice, I
could have sworn there was a knocking and whispering at the outer
door. With these fears upon me, I began either to imagine or recal
that I had had mysterious warnings of this man’s approach. That, for
weeks gone by, I had passed faces in the streets which I had thought
like his. That, these likenesses had grown more numerous, as he,
coming over the sea, had drawn near. That, his wicked spirit had
somehow sent these messengers to mine, and that now on this
stormy night he was as good as his word, and with me.
Crowding up with these reflections came the reflection that I had
xxxix] Volume II Chapter XX 295
seen him with my childish eyes to be a desperately violent man; that
I had heard that other convict reiterate that he had tried to murder
him; that I had seen him down in the ditch tearing and fighting like a
wild beast. Out of such remembrances I brought into the light of the
fire, a half-formed terror that it might not be safe to be shut up there
with him in the dead of the wild solitary night. This dilated until it
filled the room, and impelled me to take a candle and go in and look
at my dreadful burden.
He had rolled a handkerchief round his head, and his face was set
and lowering in his sleep. But he was asleep, and quietly too, though
he had a pistol lying on the pillow. Assured of this, I softly removed
the key to the outside of his door, and turned it on him before I again
sat down by the fire. Gradually I slipped from the chair and lay on
the floor. When I awoke, without having parted in my sleep with the
perception of my wretchedness, the clocks of the Eastward churches
were striking five, the candles were wasted out, the fire was dead, and
the wind and rain intensified the thick black darkness.

VOLUME III
CHAPTER I
It was fortunate for me that I had to take precautions to ensure (so
far as I could) the safety of my dreaded visitor; for, this thought
pressing on me when I awoke, held other thoughts in a confused
concourse at a distance.
The impossibility of keeping him concealed in the chambers was
self-evident. It could not be done, and the attempt to do it would
inevitably engender suspicion. True, I had no Avenger in my service
now, but I was looked after by an inflammatory old female, assisted
by an animated rag-bag whom she called her niece, and to keep a
room secret from them would be to invite curiosity and exaggeration. They both had weak eyes, which I had long attributed to their
chronically looking in at keyholes, and they were always at hand
when not wanted; indeed that was their only reliable quality besides
larceny. Not to get up a mystery with these people, I resolved to
announce in the morning that my uncle had unexpectedly come
from the country.
This course I decided on while I was yet groping about in the
darkness for the means of getting a light. Not stumbling on the
means after all, I was fain to go out to the adjacent Lodge and get
the watchman there to come with his lantern. Now, in groping
my way down the black staircase I fell over something, and that
something was a man crouching in a corner.
As the man made no answer when I asked him what he did there,
but eluded my touch in silence, I ran to the Lodge and urged the
watchman to come quickly: telling him of the incident on the way
back. The wind being as fierce as ever, we did not care to endanger
the light in the lantern by rekindling the extinguished lamps on the
staircase, but we examined the staircase from the bottom to the top
and found no one there. It then occurred to me as possible that the
man might have slipped into my rooms; so, lighting my candle at
the watchman’s, and leaving him standing at the door, I examined
them carefully, including the room in which my dreaded guest lay
asleep. All was quiet, and assuredly no other man was in those
chambers.
It troubled me that there should have been a lurker on the stairs,
on that night of all nights in the year, and I asked the watchman, on
the chance of eliciting some hopeful explanation as I handed him a
dram at the door, whether he had admitted at his gate any gentleman
who had perceptibly been dining out? Yes, he said; at different times
of the night, three. One lived in Fountain Court, and the other two
lived in the Lane, and he had seen them all go home. Again, the only
other man who dwelt in the house of which my chambers formed a
part, had been in the country for some weeks; and he certainly had
not returned in the night, because we had seen his door with his seal
on it as we came up-stairs.
“The night being so bad, sir,” said the watchman, as he gave me
back my glass, “uncommon few have come in at my gate. Besides
them three gentlemen that I have named, I don’t call to mind
another since about eleven o’clock, when a stranger asked for
you.”
“My uncle,” I muttered. “Yes.”
“You saw him, sir?”
“Yes. Oh yes.”
“Likewise the person with him?”
“Person with him!” I repeated.
“I judged the person to be with him,” returned the watchman.
“The person stopped, when he stopped to make inquiry of me, and
the person took this way when he took this way.”
“What sort of person?”
The watchman had not particularly noticed; he should say a working person; to the best of his belief, he had a dust-coloured kind of
clothes on, under a dark coat. The watchman made more light of the
matter than I did, and naturally; not having my reason for attaching
weight to it.
When I had got rid of him, which I thought it well to do without
prolonging explanations, my mind was much troubled by these two
circumstances taken together. Whereas they were easy of innocent
solution apart––as, for instance, some diner-out or diner-at-home,
who had not gone near this watchman’s gate, might have strayed to
my staircase and dropped asleep there––and my nameless visitor
might have brought some one with him to show him the way––still,
300 Great Expectations
joined, they had an ugly look to one as prone to distrust and fear as
the changes of a few hours had made me.
I lighted my fire, which burnt with a raw pale flare at that time of
the morning, and fell into a doze before it. I seemed to have been
dozing a whole night when the clocks struck six. As there was full an
hour and a half between me and daylight, I dozed again; now, waking
up uneasily, with prolix conversations about nothing, in my ears; now,
making thunder of the wind in the chimney; at length, falling off into
a profound sleep from which the daylight woke me with a start.
All this time I had never been able to consider my own situation,
nor could I do so yet. I had not the power to attend to it. I was greatly
dejected and distressed, but in an incoherent wholesale sort of way.
As to forming any plan for the future, I could as soon have formed an
elephant. When I opened the shutters and looked out at the wet wild
morning, all of a leaden hue; when I walked from room to room;
when I sat down again shivering, before the fire, waiting for my
laundress to appear; I thought how miserable I was, but hardly knew
why, or how long I had been so, or on what day of the week I made
the reflection, or even who I was that made it.
At last, the old woman and the niece came in––the latter with a
head not easily distinguishable from her dusty broom––and testified
surprise at sight of me and the fire. To whom I imparted how my
uncle had come in the night and was then asleep, and how the breakfast preparations were to be modified accordingly. Then, I washed
and dressed while they knocked the furniture about and made a dust;
and so, in a sort of dream or sleep-waking, I found myself sitting by
the fire again, waiting for––Him––to come to breakfast.
By-and-by, his door opened and he came out. I could not bring
myself to bear the sight of him, and I thought he had a worse look by
daylight.
“I do not even know,” said I, speaking low as he took his seat at the
table, “by what name to call you. I have given out that you are my
uncle.”
“That’s it, dear boy! Call me uncle.”
“You assumed some name, I suppose, on board ship?”
“Yes, dear boy. I took the name of Provis.”
“Do you mean to keep that name?”
“Why, yes, dear boy, it’s as good as another––unless you’d like
another.”
xl] Volume III Chapter I 301
“What is your real name?” I asked him in a whisper.
“Magwitch,” he answered, in the same tone; “chrisen’d Abel.”
“What were you brought up to be?”
“A warmint, dear boy.”
He answered quite seriously, and used the word as if it denoted
some profession.
“When you came into the Temple last night––––” said I, pausing
to wonder whether that could really have been last night, which
seemed so long ago.
“Yes, dear boy?”
“When you came in at the gate and asked the watchman the way
here, had you any one with you?”
“With me? No, dear boy.”
“But there was some one there?”
“I didn’t take particular notice,” he said, dubiously, “not knowing
the ways of the place. But I think there was a person, too, come in
alonger me.”
“Are you known in London?”
“I hope not!” said he, giving his neck a jerk with his forefinger that
made me turn hot and sick.
“Were you known in London, once?”
“Not over and above, dear boy. I was in the provinces mostly.”
“Were you––tried––in London?”
“Which time?” said he, with a sharp look.
“The last time.”
He nodded. “First knowed Mr. Jaggers that way. Jaggers was for
me.”
It was on my lips to ask him what he was tried for, but he took up a
knife, gave it a flourish, and with the words, “And what I done is
worked out and paid for!” fell to at his breakfast.
He ate in a ravenous way that was very disagreeable, and all his
actions were uncouth, noisy, and greedy. Some of his teeth had failed
him since I saw him eat on the marshes, and as he turned his food in
his mouth, and turned his head sideways to bring his strongest fangs
to bear upon it, he looked terribly like a hungry old dog. If I had
begun with any appetite, he would have taken it away, and I should
have sat much as I did––repelled from him by an insurmountable
aversion, and gloomily looking at the cloth.
“I’m a heavy grubber,* dear boy,” he said, as a polite kind of
302 Great Expectations
apology when he had made an end of his meal, “but I always was. If
it had been in my constitution to be a lighter grubber, I might ha’got
into lighter trouble. Sim’larly, I must have my smoke. When I was
first hired out as shepherd t’other side the world, it’s my belief I
should ha’ turned into a molloncolly-mad sheep myself, if I hadn’t a
had my smoke.”
As he said so, he got up from table, and putting his hand into the
breast of the pea-coat* he wore, brought out a short black pipe, and a
handful of loose tobacco of the kind that is called Negro-head.*
Having filled his pipe, he put the surplus tobacco back again, as if his
pocket were a drawer. Then, he took a live coal from the fire with the
tongs, and lighted his pipe at it, and then turned round on the
hearth-rug with his back to the fire, and went through his favourite
action of holding out both his hands for mine.
“And this,” said he, dandling my hands up and down in his, as he
puffed at his pipe; “and this is the gentleman what I made! The real
genuine One! It does me good fur to look at you, Pip. All I stip’late,
is, to stand by and look at you, dear boy!”
I released my hands as soon as I could, and found that I was
beginning slowly to settle down to the contemplation of my condition. What I was chained to, and how heavily, became intelligible to
me, as I heard his hoarse voice, and sat looking up at his furrowed
bald head with its iron grey hair at the sides.
“I mustn’t see my gentleman a footing it in the mire of the streets;
there mustn’t be no mud on his boots. My gentleman must have
horses, Pip! Horses to ride, and horses to drive, and horses for his
servant to ride and drive as well. Shall colonists* have their horses
(and blood ’uns, if you please, good Lord!) and not my London
gentleman? No, no. We’ll show ’em another pair of shoes* than that,
Pip; won’t us?”
He took out of his pocket a great thick pocket-book, bursting with
papers, and tossed it on the table.
“There’s something worth spending in that there book, dear boy.
It’s yourn. All I’ve got ain’t mine; it’s yourn. Don’t you be afeerd on
it. There’s more where that come from. I’ve come to the old country
fur to see my gentleman spend his money like a gentleman. That’ll
be my pleasure. My pleasure ’ull be fur to see him do it. And blast
you all!” he wound up, looking round the room and snapping his
fingers once with a loud snap, “blast you every one, from the judge in
xl] Volume III Chapter I 303
his wig, to the colonist a stirring up the dust, I’ll show a better
gentleman than the whole kit on you put together!”
“Stop!” said I, almost in a frenzy of fear and dislike, “I want to
speak to you. I want to know what is to be done. I want to know how
you are to be kept out of danger, how long you are going to stay, what
projects you have.”
“Look’ee here, Pip,” said he, laying his hand on my arm in a
suddenly altered and subdued manner; “first of all, look’ee here. I
forgot myself half a minute ago. What I said was low; that’s what it
was; low. Look’ee here, Pip. Look over it. I ain’t a going to be low.”
“First,” I resumed, half groaning, “what precautions can be taken
against your being recognised and seized?”
“No, dear boy,” he said, in the same tone as before, “that don’t go
first. Lowness goes first. I ain’t took so many year to make a gentleman, not without knowing what’s due to him. Look’ee here, Pip. I
was low; that’s what I was; low. Look over it, dear boy.”
Some sense of the grimly-ludicrous moved me to a fretful laugh,
as I replied, “I have looked over it. In Heaven’s name, don’t harp
upon it!”
“Yes, but look’ee here,” he persisted. “Dear boy, I ain’t come so
fur to be low. Now, go on, dear boy. You was a saying––––”
“How are you to be guarded from the danger you have incurred?”
“Well, dear boy, the danger ain’t so great. Without I was informed
agen, the danger ain’t so much to signify. There’s Jaggers, and
there’s Wemmick, and there’s you. Who else is there to inform?”
“Is there no chance person who might identify you in the street?”
said I.
“Well,” he returned, “there ain’t many. Nor yet I don’t intend to
advertise myself in the newspapers by the name of A. M. come back
from Botany Bay;* and years has rolled away, and who’s to gain by it?
Still, look’ee here, Pip. If the danger had been fifty times as great, I
should ha’ come to see you, mind you, just the same.”
“And how long do you remain?”
“How long?” said he, taking his black pipe from his mouth, and
dropping his jaw as he stared at me. “I’m not a going back. I’ve come
for good.”
“Where are you to live?” said I. “What is to be done with you?
Where will you be safe?”
“Dear boy,” he returned, “there’s disguising wigs can be bought
304 Great Expectations
for money, and there’s hair powder, and spectacles, and black
clothes––shorts* and what not. Others has done it safe afore, and
what others has done afore, others can do agen. As to the where and
how of living, dear boy, give me your own opinions on it.”
“You take it smoothly now,” said I, “but you were very serious last
night, when you swore it was Death.”
“And so I swear it is Death,” said he, putting his pipe back in his
mouth, “and Death by the rope, in the open street not fur from this,*
and it’s serious that you should fully understand it to be so. What
then, when that’s once done? Here I am. To go back now, ’ud be as bad
as to stand ground––worse. Besides, Pip, I’m here, because I’ve meant
it by you, years and years. As to what I dare, I’m a old bird now, as has
dared all manner of traps since first he was fledged, and I’m not afeerd
to perch upon a scarecrow. If there’s Death hid inside of it, there is,
and let him come out, and I’ll face him, and then I’ll believe in him
and not afore. And now let me have a look at my gentleman agen.”
Once more, he took me by both hands and surveyed me with an air
of admiring proprietorship: smoking with great complacency all the
while.
It appeared to me that I could do no better than secure him some
quiet lodging hard by, of which he might take possession when Herbert returned: whom I expected in two or three days. That the secret
must be confided to Herbert as a matter of unavoidable necessity,
even if I could have put the immense relief I should derive from
sharing it with him out of the question, was plain to me. But it was
by no means so plain to Mr. Provis (I resolved to call him by that
name), who reserved his consent to Herbert’s participation until he
should have seen him and formed a favourable judgment of his
physiognomy. “And even then, dear boy,” said he, pulling a greasy
little clasped black Testament out of his pocket, “we’ll have him on
his oath.”
To state that my terrible patron carried this little black book about
the world solely to swear people on in cases of emergency, would be
to state what I never quite established––but this I can say, that I
never knew him put it to any other use. The book itself had the
appearance of having been stolen from some court of justice, and
perhaps his knowledge of its antecedents, combined with his own
experience in that wise, gave him a reliance on its powers as a sort of
legal spell or charm. On this first occasion of his producing it, I
xl] Volume III Chapter I 305
recalled how he had made me swear fidelity in the churchyard long
ago, and how he had described himself last night as always swearing
to his resolutions in his solitude.
As he was at present dressed in a seafaring slop suit,* in which he
looked as if he had some parrots and cigars to dispose of, I next
discussed with him what dress he should wear. He cherished an
extraordinary belief in the virtues of “shorts” as a disguise, and had
in his own mind sketched a dress for himself that would have made
him something between a dean and a dentist. It was with considerable difficulty that I won him over to the assumption of a dress more
like a prosperous farmer’s; and we arranged that he should cut his
hair close, and wear a little powder. Lastly, as he had not yet been
seen by the laundress or her niece, he was to keep himself out of their
view until his change of dress was made.
It would seem a simple matter to decide on these precautions; but
in my dazed, not to say distracted, state, it took so long, that I did not
get out to further them, until two or three in the afternoon. He was
to remain shut up in the chambers while I was gone, and was on no
account to open the door.
There being to my knowledge a respectable lodging-house in
Essex-street, the back of which looked into the Temple, and was
almost within hail of my windows, I first of all repaired to that house,
and was so fortunate to secure the second floor for my uncle, Mr.
Provis. I then went from shop to shop, making such purchases as
were necessary to the change in his appearance. This business transacted, I turned my face, on my own account, to Little Britain. Mr.
Jaggers was at his desk, but, seeing me enter, got up immediately and
stood before his fire.
“Now, Pip,” said he, “be careful.”
“I will, sir,” I returned. For, I had thought well of what I was
going to say coming along.
“Don’t commit yourself,” said Mr. Jaggers, “and don’t commit
any one. You understand––any one. Don’t tell me anything: I don’t
want to know anything; I am not curious.”
Of course I saw that he knew the man was come.
“I merely want, Mr. Jaggers,” said I, “to assure myself that what I
have been told, is true. I have no hope of its being untrue, but at least
I may verify it.”
Mr. Jaggers nodded. “But did you say ‘told’ or ‘informed’?” he
306 Great Expectations
asked me, with his head on one side, and not looking at me, but
looking in a listening way at the floor. “Told would seem to imply
verbal communication. You can’t have verbal communication with a
man in New South Wales, you know.”
“I will say, informed, Mr. Jaggers.”
“Good.”
“I have been informed by a person named Abel Magwitch, that he
is the benefactor so long unknown to me.”
“That is the man,” said Mr. Jaggers, “––in New South Wales.”
“And only he?” said I.
“And only he,” said Mr. Jaggers.
“I am not so unreasonable, sir, as to think you at all responsible for
my mistakes and wrong conclusions; but I always supposed it was
Miss Havisham.”
“As you say, Pip,” returned Mr. Jaggers, turning his eyes upon me
coolly, and taking a bite at his forefinger, “I am not at all responsible
for that.”
“And yet it looked so like it, sir,” I pleaded with a downcast heart.
“Not a particle of evidence, Pip,” said Mr. Jaggers, shaking his
head and gathering up his skirts. “Take nothing on its looks; take
everything on evidence. There’s no better rule.”
“I have no more to say,” said I, with a sigh, after standing silent for
a little while. “I have verified my information, and there an end.”
“And Magwitch––in New South Wales––having at last disclosed
himself,” said Mr. Jaggers, “you will comprehend, Pip, how rigidly
thoughout my communication with you, I have always adhered to the
strict line of fact. There has never been the least departure from the
strict line of fact. You are quite aware of that?”
“Quite, sir.”
“I communicated to Magwitch––in New South Wales––when he
first wrote to me––from New South Wales––the caution that he
must not expect me ever to deviate from the strict line of fact. I also
communicated to him another caution. He appeared to me to have
obscurely hinted in his letter at some distant idea he had of seeing
you in England here. I cautioned him that I must hear no more of
that; that he was not at all likely to obtain a pardon; that he was
expatriated for the term of his natural life; and that his presenting
himself in this country would be an act of felony, rendering him
liable to the extreme penalty of the law. I gave Magwitch that
xl] Volume III Chapter I 307
caution,” said Mr. Jaggers, looking hard at me; “I wrote it to New
South Wales. He guided himself by it, no doubt.”
“No doubt,” said I.
“I have been informed by Wemmick,” pursued Mr. Jaggers,
still looking hard at me, “that he has received a letter, under date
Portsmouth, from a colonist of the name of Purvis, or––––”
“Or Provis,” I suggested.
“Or Provis––thank you, Pip. Perhaps it is Provis? Perhaps you
know it’s Provis?”
“Yes,” said I.
“You know it’s Provis. A letter, under date Portsmouth, from a
colonist of the name of Provis, asking for the particulars of your
address, on behalf of Magwitch. Wemmick sent him the particulars,
I understand, by return of post. Probably it is through Provis that
you have received the explanation of Magwitch––in New South
Wales?”
“It came through Provis,” I replied.
“Good day, Pip,” said Mr. Jaggers, offering his hand; “glad to have
seen you. In writing by post to Magwitch––in New South Wales––or
in communicating with him through Provis, have the goodness to
mention that the particulars and vouchers of our long account shall
be sent to you, together with the balance; for there is still a balance
remaining. Good day, Pip!”
We shook hands, and he looked hard at me as long as he could see
me. I turned at the door, and he was still looking hard at me, while
the two vile casts on the shelf seemed to be trying to get their eyelids
open, and to force out of their swollen throats, “O, what a man
he is!”
Wemmick was out, and though he had been at his desk he could
have done nothing for me. I went straight back to the Temple, where
I found the terrible Provis drinking rum-and-water and smoking
negro-head, in safety.
Next day the clothes I had ordered, all came home, and he put
them on. Whatever he put on, became him less (it dismally seemed to
me) than what he had worn before. To my thinking, there was something in him that made it hopeless to attempt to disguise him. The
more I dressed him and the better I dressed him, the more he looked
like the slouching fugitive on the marshes. This effect on my anxious
fancy was partly referable, no doubt, to his old face and manner
308 Great Expectations
growing more familiar to me; but I believe too that he dragged one of
his legs as if there were still a weight of iron on it, and that from head
to foot there was Convict in the very grain of the man.
The influences of his solitary hut-life were upon him besides, and
gave him a savage air that no dress could tame; added to these, were
the influences of his subsequent branded life among men, and,
crowning all, his consciousness that he was dodging and hiding now.
In all his ways of sitting and standing, and eating and drinking––of
brooding about, in a high-shouldered reluctant style––of taking out
his great horn-handled jack-knife and wiping it on his legs and
cutting his food––of lifting light glasses and cups to his lips, as if
they were clumsy pannikins*––of chopping a wedge off his bread,
and soaking up with it the last fragments of gravy round and round
his plate, as if to make the most of an allowance, and then drying his
finger-ends on it, and then swallowing it––in these ways and a thousand other small nameless instances arising every minute in the day,
there was Prisoner, Felon, Bondsman, plain as plain could be.
It had been his own idea to wear that touch of powder, and I had
conceded the powder after overcoming the shorts. But I can compare
the effect of it, when on, to nothing but the probable effect of rouge
upon the dead; so awful was the manner in which everything in him
that it was most desirable to repress, started through that thin layer
of pretence, and seemed to come blazing out at the crown of his
head. It was abandoned as soon as tried, and he wore his grizzled hair
cut short.
Words cannot tell what a sense I had, at the same time, of the
dreadful mystery that he was to me. When he fell asleep of an evening, with his knotted hands clenching the sides of the easy-chair, and
his bald head tattooed with deep wrinkles falling forward on his
breast, I would sit and look at him, wondering what he had done, and
loading him with all the crimes in the Calendar,* until the impulse
was powerful on me to start up and fly from him. Every hour so
increased my abhorrence of him, that I even think I might have
yielded to this impulse in the first agonies of being so haunted,
notwithstanding all he had done for me, and the risk he ran, but for
the knowledge that Herbert must soon come back. Once, I actually
did start out of bed in the night, and begin to dress myself in my
worst clothes, hurriedly intending to leave him there with everything
else I possessed, and enlist for India as a private soldier.
xl] Volume III Chapter I 309
I doubt if a ghost could have been more terrible to me, up in those
lonely rooms in the long evenings and long nights, with the wind and
the rain always rushing by. A ghost could not have been taken and
hanged on my account, and the consideration that he could be, and
the dread that he would be, were no small addition to my horrors.
When he was not asleep, or playing a complicated kind of Patience
with a ragged pack of cards of his own––a game that I never saw
before or since, and in which he recorded his winnings by sticking
his jack-knife into the table––when he was not engaged in either of
these pursuits, he would ask me to read to him––“Foreign language,
dear boy!” While I complied, he, not comprehending a single
word, would stand before the fire surveying me with the air of an
Exhibitor,* and I would see him, between the fingers of the hand
with which I shaded my face, appealing in dumb show to the furniture to take notice of my proficiency. The imaginary student pursued
by the misshapen creature* he had impiously made, was not more
wretched than I, pursued by the creature who had made me, and
recoiling from him with a stronger repulsion, the more he admired
me and the fonder he was of me.
This is written of, I am sensible, as if it had lasted a year. It lasted
about five days. Expecting Herbert all the time, I dared not go out,
except when I took Provis for an airing after dark. At length, one
evening when dinner was over and I had dropped into a slumber
quite worn out––for my nights had been agitated and my rest
broken by fearful dreams––I was roused by the welcome footstep on
the staircase. Provis, who had been asleep too, staggered up at the
noise I made, and in an instant I saw his jack-knife shining in his
hand.
“Quiet! It’s Herbert!” I said; and Herbert came bursting in, with
the airy freshness of six hundred miles of France upon him.
“Handel, my dear fellow, how are you, and again how are you, and
again how are you? I seem to have been gone a twelvemonth! Why, so
I must have been, for you have grown quite thin and pale! Handel,
my––––Halloa! I beg your pardon.”
He was stopped in his running on and in his shaking hands with
me, by seeing Provis. Provis, regarding him with a fixed attention,
was slowly putting up his jack-knife, and groping in another pocket
for something else.
“Herbert, my dear friend,” said I, shutting the double doors,
310 Great Expectations
while Herbert stood staring and wondering, “something very strange
has happened. This is––a visitor of mine.”
“It’s all right, dear boy!” said Provis coming forward, with his
little clasped black book, and then addressing himself to Herbert.
“Take it in your right hand. Lord strike you dead on the spot, if ever
you split* in any way sumever! Kiss it!”
“Do so, as he wishes it,” I said to Herbert. So, Herbert, looking at
me with a friendly uneasiness and amazement, complied, and Provis
immediately shaking hands with him, said, “Now you’re on your
oath, you know. And never believe me on mine, if Pip shan’t make a
gentleman on you!”
CHAPTER II
In vain should I attempt to describe the astonishment and disquiet
of Herbert, when he and I and Provis sat down before the fire, and I
recounted the whole of the secret. Enough, that I saw my own feelings reflected in Herbert’s face, and, not least among them, my
repugnance towards the man who had done so much for me.
What would alone have set a division between that man and us, if
there had been no other dividing circumstance, was his triumph in
my story. Saving his troublesome sense of having been “low” on one
occasion since his return––on which point he began to hold forth to
Herbert, the moment my revelation was finished––he had no perception of the possibility of my finding any fault with my good fortune.
His boast that he had made me a gentleman, and that he had come to
see me support the character on his ample resources, was made for
me quite as much as for himself; and that it was a highly agreeable
boast to both of us, and that we must both be very proud of it, was a
conclusion quite established in his own mind.
“Though, look’ee here, Pip’s comrade,” he said to Herbert, after
having discoursed for some time, “I know very well that once since I
come back––for half a minute––I’ve been low. I said to Pip, I knowed
as I had been low. But don’t you fret yourself on that score. I ain’t
made Pip a gentleman, and Pip ain’t agoing to make you a gentleman, not fur me not to know what’s due to ye both. Dear boy, and
Pip’s comrade, you two may count upon me always having a gen-teel
muzzle on. Muzzled I have been since that half a minute when I was
xli] Volume III Chapter II 311
betrayed to lowness, muzzled I am at the present time, muzzled I
ever will be.”
Herbert said, “Certainly,” but looked as if there were no specific
consolation in this, and remained perplexed and dismayed. We were
anxious for the time when he would go to his lodging, and leave us
together, but he was evidently jealous of leaving us together, and sat
late. It was midnight before I took him round to Essex-street, and
saw him safely in at his own dark door. When it closed upon him, I
experienced the first moment of relief I had known since the night of
his arrival.
Never quite free from an uneasy remembrance of the man on the
stairs, I had always looked about me in taking my guest out after
dark, and in bringing him back; and I looked about me now. Difficult
as it is in a large city to avoid the suspicion of being watched, when
the mind is conscious of danger in that regard, I could not persuade
myself that any of the people within sight cared about my movements. The few who were passing, passed on their several ways, and
the street was empty when I turned back into the Temple. Nobody
had come out at the gate with us, nobody went in at the gate with me.
As I crossed by the fountain, I saw his lighted back windows looking
bright and quiet, and, when I stood for a few moments in the doorway of the building where I lived, before going up the stairs,
Garden-court was as still and lifeless as the staircase was when I
ascended it.
Herbert received me with open arms, and I had never felt before,
so blessedly, what it is to have a friend. When he had spoken some
sound words of sympathy and encouragement, we sat down to consider the question, What was to be done?
The chair that Provis had occupied still remaining where it had
stood––for he had a barrack way with him of hanging about one
spot, in one unsettled manner, and going through one round of
observances with his pipe and his negro-head and his jack-knife and
his pack of cards, and what not, as if it were all put down for him on
a slate––I say, his chair remaining where it had stood, Herbert
unconsciously took it, but next moment started out of it, pushed it
away, and took another. He had no occasion to say, after that, that he
had conceived an aversion for my patron, neither had I occasion to
confess my own. We interchanged that confidence without shaping a
syllable.
312 Great Expectations
“What,” said I to Herbert, when he was safe in another chair,
“what is to be done?”
“My poor dear Handel,” he replied, holding his head, “I am too
stunned to think.”
“So was I, Herbert, when the blow first fell. Still, something must
be done. He is intent upon various new expenses––horses, and carriages, and lavish appearances of all kinds. He must be stopped
somehow.”
“You mean that you can’t accept––––?”
“How can I?” I interposed, as Herbert paused. “Think of him!
Look at him!”
An involuntary shudder passed over both of us.
“Yet I am afraid the dreadful truth is, Herbert, that he is attached
to me, strongly attached to me. Was there ever such a fate!”
“My poor dear Handel,” Herbert repeated.
“Then,” said I, “after all, stopping short here, never taking
another penny from him, think what I owe him already! Then again:
I am heavily in debt––very heavily for me, who have now no
expectations––and I have been bred to no calling, and I am fit for
nothing.”
“Well, well, well!” Herbert remonstrated. “Don’t say fit for
nothing.”
“What am I fit for? I know only one thing that I am fit for, and that
is, to go for a soldier. And I might have gone, my dear Herbert, but for
the prospect of taking counsel with your friendship and affection.”
Of course I broke down there; and of course Herbert, beyond
seizing a warm grip of my hand, pretended not to know it.
“Anyhow, my dear Handel,” said he presently, “soldiering won’t
do. If you were to renounce this patronage and these favours, I
suppose you would do so with some faint hope of one day repaying
what you have already had. Not very strong, that hope, if you went
soldiering! Besides, it’s absurd. You would be infinitely better in
Clarriker’s house, small as it is. I am working up towards a partnership, you know.”
Poor fellow! He little suspected with whose money.
“But there is another question,” said Herbert. “This is an ignorant determined man, who has long had one fixed idea. More than
that, he seems to me (I may misjudge him) to be a man of a desperate
and fierce character.”
xli] Volume III Chapter II 313
“I know he is,” I returned. “Let me tell you what evidence I have
seen of it.” And I told him what I had not mentioned in my narrative; of that encounter with the other convict.
“See, then,” said Herbert; “think of this! He comes here at the
peril of his life, for the realisation of his fixed idea. In the moment
of realisation, after all his toil and waiting, you cut the ground
from under his feet, destroy his idea, and make his gains worthless
to him. Do you see nothing that he might do, under the disappointment?”
“I have seen it, Herbert, and dreamed of it, ever since the fatal
night of his arrival. Nothing has been in my thoughts so distinctly, as
his putting himself in the way of being taken.”
“Then you may rely upon it,” said Herbert, “that there would be
great danger of his doing it. That is his power over you as long as he
remains in England, and that would be his reckless course if you
forsook him.”
I was so struck by the horror of this idea, which had weighed upon
me from the first, and the working out of which would make me
regard myself, in some sort, as his murderer, that I could not rest in
my chair but began pacing to and fro. I said to Herbert, meanwhile,
that even if Provis were recognised and taken, in spite of himself, I
should be wretched as the cause, however innocently. Yes; even
though I was so wretched in having him at large and near me, and
even though I would far far rather have worked at the forge all the
days of my life than I would ever have come to this!
But there was no raving off the question, What was to be done?
“The first and the main thing to be done,” said Herbert, “is to get
him out of England. You will have to go with him, and then he may
be induced to go.”
“But get him where I will, could I prevent his coming back?”
“My good Handel, is it not obvious that with Newgate in the next
street, there must be far greater hazard in your breaking your mind
to him and making him reckless, here, than elsewhere. If a pretext to
get him away could be made out of that other convict, or out of
anything else in his life, now.”
“There, again!” said I, stopping before Herbert, with my open
hands held out, as if they contained the desperation of the case. “I
know nothing of his life. It has almost made me mad to sit here of a
night and see him before me, so bound up with my fortunes and
314 Great Expectations
misfortunes, and yet so unknown to me, except as the miserable
wretch who terrified me two days in my childhood!”
Herbert got up, and linked his arm in mine, and we slowly walked
to and fro together, studying the carpet.
“Handel,” said Herbert, stopping, “you feel convinced that you
can take no further benefits from him; do you?”
“Fully. Surely you would, too, if you were in my place?”
“And you feel convinced that you must break with him?”
“Herbert, can you ask me?”
“And you have, and are bound to have, that tenderness for the life
he has risked on your account, that you must save him, if possible,
from throwing it away. Then you must get him out of England before
you stir a finger to extricate yourself. That done, extricate yourself,
in Heaven’s name, and we’ll see it out together, dear old boy.”
It was a comfort to shake hands upon it, and walk up and down
again, with only that done.
“Now, Herbert,” said I, “with reference to gaining some knowledge of his history. There is but one way that I know of. I must ask
him point-blank.”
“Yes. Ask him,” said Herbert, “when we sit at breakfast in the
morning.” For, he had said, on taking leave of Herbert, that he
would come to breakfast with us.
With this project formed, we went to bed. I had the wildest
dreams concerning him, and woke unrefreshed; I woke, too, to
recover the fear which I had lost in the night of his being found out
as a returned transport. Waking, I never lost that fear.
He came round at the appointed time, took out his jack-knife, and
sat down to his meal. He was full of plans “for his gentleman’s
coming out strong, and like a gentleman,” and urged me to begin
speedily upon the pocket-book, which he had left in my possession.
He considered the chambers and his own lodging as temporary residences, and advised me to look out at once for a “fashionable crib”
near Hyde Park, in which he could have “a shake-down.”* When he
had made an end of his breakfast, and was wiping his knife on his
leg, I said to him, without a word of preface:
“After you were gone last night, I told my friend of the struggle
that the soldiers found you engaged in on the marshes, when we
came up. You remember?”
“Remember!” said he. “I think so!”
xli] Volume III Chapter II 315
“We want to know something about that man––and about you. It
is strange to know no more about either, and particularly you, than I
was able to tell last night. Is not this as good a time as another for our
knowing more?”
“Well!” he said, after consideration. “You’re on your oath, you
know, Pip’s comrade?”
“Assuredly,” replied Herbert.
“As to anything I say, you know,” he insisted. “The oath applies to
all.”
“I understand it to do so.”
“And look’ee here! Wotever I done, is worked out and paid for,”
he insisted again.
“So be it.”
He took out his black pipe and was going to fill it with negro-head,
when, looking at the tangle of tobacco in his hand, he seemed to
think it might perplex the thread of his narrative. He put it back
again, stuck his pipe in a button-hole of his coat, spread a hand on
each knee, and, after turning an angry eye on the fire for a few silent
moments, looked round at us and said what follows.
CHAPTER III
“Dear boy and Pip’s comrade. I am not a going fur to tell you my
life, like a song or a story-book.* But to give it you short and handy,
I’ll put it at once into a mouthful of English. In jail and out of jail,*
in jail and out of jail, in jail and out of jail. There, you’ve got it.
That’s my life pretty much, down to such times as I got shipped off,
arter Pip stood my friend.
“I’ve been done everything to, pretty well––except hanged. I’ve
been locked up, as much as a silver tea-kettle. I’ve been carted here
and carted there, and put out of this town* and put out of that town,
and stuck in the stocks,* and whipped and worried and drove. I’ve
no more notion where I was born, than you have––if so much. I first
become aware of myself, down in Essex, a thieving turnips for my
living. Summun had run away from me––a man––a tinker––and he’d
took the fire with him,* and left me wery cold.
“I know’d my name to be Magwitch, chrisen’d Abel. How did I
know it? Much as I know’d the birds’ names in the hedges to be
316 Great Expectations
chaffinch, sparrer, thrush. I might have thought it was all lies
together, only as the birds’ names come out true, I supposed mine
did.
“So fur as I could find, there warn’t a soul that see young Abel
Magwitch, with as little on him as in him, but wot caught fright at
him, and either drove him off, or took him up. I was took up, took up,
took up, to that extent that I reg’larly grow’d up took up.
“This is the way it was, that when I was a ragged little creetur as
much to be pitied as ever I see (not that I looked in the glass, for
there warn’t many insides of furnished houses known to me), I got
the name of being hardened. ‘This is a terrible hardened one,’ they
says to prison wisitors, picking out me. ‘May be said to live in jails,
this boy.’ Then they looked at me, and I looked at them, and they
measured my head,* some on ’em––they had better a measured my
stomach––and others on ’em giv me tracts what I couldn’t read, and
made me speeches what I couldn’t understand. They always went on
agen me about the Devil. But what the Devil was I to do? I must put
something into my stomach, mustn’t I?––Howsomever, I’m a getting
low, and I know what’s due. Dear boy and Pip’s comrade, don’t you
be afeerd of me being low.
“Tramping, begging, thieving, working sometimes when I
could––though that warn’t as often as you may think, till you put the
question whether you would ha’ been over ready to give me work
yourselves––a bit of a poacher, a bit of a labourer, a bit of a waggoner, a bit of a haymaker, a bit of a hawker,* a bit of most things that
don’t pay and lead to trouble, I got to be a man. A deserting soldier
in a Travellers’ Rest,* what lay hid up to the chin under a lot of
taturs, learnt me to read; and a travelling Giant what signed his name
at a penny a time learnt me to write. I warn’t locked up as often now
as formerly, but I wore out my good share of key-metal still.
“At Epsom races,* a matter of over twenty year ago, I got
acquainted wi’ a man whose skull I’d crack wi’ this poker, like the
claw of a lobster, if I’d got it on this hob. His right name was Compeyson; and that’s the man, dear boy, what you see me a pounding in
the ditch, according to what you truly told your comrade arter I was
gone last night.
“He set up fur a gentleman, this Compeyson, and he’d been to a
public boarding-school and had learning. He was a smooth one to
talk, and was a dab at the ways of gentlefolks. He was good-looking
xlii] Volume III Chapter III 317
too. It was the night afore the great race, when I found him on the
heath, in a booth that I know’d on. Him and some more was a sitting
among the tables when I went in, and the landlord (which had a
knowledge of me, and was a sporting one) called him out, and said, ‘I
think this is a man that might suit you’––meaning I was.
“Compeyson, he looks at me very noticing, and I look at him. He
has a watch and a chain and a ring and a breast-pin and a handsome
suit of clothes.
“ ‘To judge from appearances, you’re out of luck,’ says Compeyson to me.
“ ‘Yes, master, and I’ve never been in it much.’ (I had come out of
Kingston Jail last on a vagrancy committal.* Not but what it might
have been for something else; but it warn’t.)
“ ‘Luck changes,’ says Compeyson; ‘perhaps yours is going to
change.’
“I says, ‘I hope it may be so. There’s room.’
“ ‘What can you do?’ says Compeyson.
“ ‘Eat and drink,’ I says; ‘if you’ll find the materials.’
“Compeyson laughed, looked at me again very noticing, giv me
five shillings, and appinted me for next night. Same place.
“I went to Compeyson next night, same place, and Compeyson
took me on to be his man and pardner. And what was Compeyson’s
business in which we was to go pardners? Compeyson’s business was
the swindling, handwriting forging, stolen bank-note passing, and
such-like. All sorts of traps as Compeyson could set with his head,
and keep his own legs out of and get the profits from and let another
man in for, was Compeyson’s business. He’d no more heart than a
iron file, he was as cold as death, and he had the head of the Devil
afore mentioned.
“There was another in with Compeyson, as was called Arthur––
not as being so chrisen’d, but as a surname. He was in a Decline, and
was a shadow to look at. Him and Compeyson had been in a bad
thing with a rich lady some years afore, and they’d made a pot of
money by it; but Compeyson betted and gamed; and he’d have run
through the king’s taxes.* So, Arthur was a dying, and a dying poor
and with the horrors* on him, and Compeyson’s wife (which Compeyson kicked mostly) was a having pity on him when she could, and
Compeyson was a having pity on nothing and nobody.
“I might a took warning by Arthur, but I didn’t; and I won’t
318 Great Expectations
pretend I was partick’ler––for where ’ud be the good on it, dear boy
and comrade? So I begun wi’ Compeyson, and a poor tool I was in
his hands. Arthur lived at the top of Compeyson’s house (over nigh
Brentford it was), and Compeyson kept a careful account agen him
for board and lodging, in case he should ever get better to work it
out. But Arthur soon settled the account. The second or third time
as I ever see him, he come a tearing down into Compeyson’s parlour
late at night, in only a flannel gown, with his hair all in a sweat, and
he says to Compeyson’s wife, ‘Sally, she really is up-stairs alonger
me, now, and I can’t get rid of her. She’s all in white,’ he says, ‘wi’
white flowers in her hair, and she’s awful mad, and she’s got a shroud
hanging over her arm, and she says she’ll put it on me at five in the
morning.’
“Says Compeyson: ‘Why, you fool, don’t you know she’s got a
living body? And how should she be up there, without coming
through the door, or in at the window, and up the stairs?’
“ ‘I don’t know how she’s there,’ says Arthur, shivering dreadful
with the horrors, ‘but she’s standing in the corner at the foot of the
bed, awful mad. And over where her heart’s broke––you broke it!––
there’s drops of blood.’
“Compeyson spoke hardy, but he was always a coward. ‘Go up
alonger this drivelling sick man,’ he says to his wife, ‘and Magwitch,
lend her a hand, will you?’ But he never come nigh himself.
“Compeyson’s wife and me took him up to bed agen, and he raved
most dreadful. ‘Why look at her!’ he cries out. ‘She’s a shaking the
shroud at me! Don’t you see her? Look at her eyes! Ain’t it awful to
see her so mad?’ Next, he cries, ‘She’ll put it on me, and then I’m
done for! Take it away from her, take it away!’ And then he catched
hold of us, and kep on a talking to her, and answering of her, till I
half believed I see her myself.
“Compeyson’s wife, being used to him, giv him some liquor to get
the horrors off, and by-and-by he quieted. ‘Oh, she’s gone! Has her
keeper* been for her?’ he says. ‘Yes,’ says Compeyson’s wife. ‘Did
you tell him to lock her and bar her in?’ ‘Yes.’ ‘And to take that ugly
thing away from her?’ ‘Yes, yes, all right.’ ‘You’re a good creetur,’ he
says, ‘don’t leave me, whatever you do, and thank you!’
“He rested pretty quiet till it might want a few minutes of five,
and then he starts up with a scream, and screams out, ‘Here she is!
She’s got the shroud again. She’s unfolding it. She’s coming out of
xlii] Volume III Chapter III 319
the corner. She’s coming to the bed. Hold me, both on you––one of
each side––don’t let her touch me with it. Hah! she missed me that
time. Don’t let her throw it over my shoulders. Don’t let her lift me
up to get it round me. She’s lifting me up. Keep me down!’ Then he
lifted himself up hard, and was dead.
“Compeyson took it easy as a good riddance for both sides. Him
and me was soon busy, and first he swore me (being ever artful) on
my own book––this here little black book, dear boy, what I swore
your comrade on.
“Not to go into the things that Compeyson planned, and I done––
which ’ud take a week––I’ll simply say to you, dear boy, and Pip’s
comrade, that the man got me into such nets as made me his black
slave. I was always in debt to him, always under his thumb, always a
working, always a getting into danger. He was younger than me, but
he’d got craft, and he’d got learning, and he overmatched me five
hundred times told and no mercy. My Missis as I had the hard time
wi’––––Stop though! I ain’t brought her in––––”
He looked about him in a confused way, as if he had lost his place
in the book of his remembrance; and he turned his face to the fire,
and spread his hands broader on his knees, and lifted them off and
put them on again.
“There ain’t no need to go into it,” he said, looking round once
more. “The time wi’ Compeyson was a’most as hard a time as ever I
had; that said, all’s said. Did I tell you as I was tried, alone, for
misdemeanour, while with Compeyson?”
I answered, No.
“Well!” he said, “I was, and got convicted. As to took up on
suspicion, that was twice or three times in the four or five year that it
lasted; but evidence was wanting. At last, me and Compeyson was
both committed for felony––on a charge of putting stolen notes in
circulation––and there was other charges behind. Compeyson says
to me, ‘Separate defences, no communication,’ and that was all. And
I was so miserable poor, that I sold all the clothes I had, except what
hung on my back, afore I could get Jaggers.
“When we was put in the dock, I noticed first of all what a
gentleman Compeyson looked, wi’ his curly hair and his black
clothes and his white pocket-handkercher, and what a common sort
of wretch I looked. When the prosecution opened and the evidence
was put short, aforehand, I noticed how heavy it all bore on me,
320 Great Expectations
and how light on him. When the evidence was giv in the box, I
noticed how it was always me that had come for’ard, and could be
swore to, how it was always me that the money had been paid to, how
it was always me that had seemed to work the thing and get the
profit. But, when the defence come on, then I see the plan plainer;
for, says the counsellor for Compeyson, ‘My Lord and gentlemen,
here you has afore you, side by side, two persons as your eyes can
separate wide; one, the younger, well brought up, who will be spoke
to as such; one, the elder, ill brought up, who will be spoke to as
such; one, the younger, seldom if ever seen in these here transactions, and only suspected; t’other, the elder, always seen in ’em and
always wi’ his guilt brought home. Can you doubt, if there is but one
in it, which is the one, and, if there is two in it, which is much the
worst one?’And such-like. And when it come to character, warn’t it
Compeyson as had been to the school, and warn’t it his schoolfellows
as was in this position and in that, and warn’t it him as had been
know’d by witnesses in such clubs and societies, and nowt to his
disadvantage? And warn’t it me as had been tried afore, and as had
been know’d up hill and down dale in Bridewells and Lock-Ups?*
And when it came to speech-making, warn’t it Compeyson as could
speak to ’em wi’ his face dropping every now and then into his white
pocket-handkercher––ah! and wi’ verses in his speech, too––and
warn’t it me as could only say, ‘Gentleman, this man at my side
is a most precious rascal’? And when the verdict come, warn’t it
Compeyson as was recommended to mercy on account of good
character and bad company, and giving up all the information he
could agen me, and warn’t it me as got never a word but Guilty? And
when I says to Compeyson, ‘Once out of this court, I’ll smash that
face o’ yourn?’ ain’t it Compeyson as prays the Judge to be protected, and gets two turnkeys stood betwixt us? And when we’re
sentenced, ain’t it him as gets seven year, and me fourteen,* and ain’t
it him as the Judge is sorry for, because he might a done so well, and
ain’t it me as the Judge perceives to be a old offender of wiolent
passion, likely to come to worse?”
He had worked himself into a state of great excitement, but he
checked it, took two or three short breaths, swallowed as often, and
stretching out his hand towards me said, in a reassuring manner, “I
ain’t a going to be low, dear boy!”
He had so heated himself that he took out his handkerchief
xlii] Volume III Chapter III 321
and wiped his face and head and neck and hands, before he could
go on.
“I had said to Compeyson that I’d smash that face of his, and I
swore Lord smash mine! to do it. We was in the same prison-ship, but
I couldn’t get at him for long, though I tried. At last I came behind
him and hit him on the cheek to turn him round and get a smashing
one at him, when I was seen and seized. The black-hole* of that ship
warn’t a strong one, to a judge of black-holes that could swim and
dive. I escaped to the shore, and I was a hiding among the graves there,
envying them as was in ’em and all over, when I first see my boy!”
He regarded me with a look of affection that made him almost
abhorrent to me again, though I had felt great pity for him.
“By my boy, I was giv to unnerstand as Compeyson was out on
them marshes too. Upon my soul, I half believe he escaped in his
terror, to get quit of me, not knowing it was me as had got ashore. I
hunted him down. I smashed his face. ‘And now,’ says I, ‘as the worst
thing I can do, caring nothing for myself, I’ll drag you back.’ And I’d
have swum off, towing him by the hair, if it had come to that, and I’d
a got him aboard without the soldiers.
“Of course he’d much the best of it to the last––his character was
so good. He had escaped when he was made half wild by me and my
murderous intentions; and his punishment was light. I was put in
irons, brought to trial again, and sent for life. I didn’t stop for life,
dear boy and Pip’s comrade, being here.”
He wiped himself again, as he had done before, and then slowly
took his tangle of tobacco from his pocket, and plucked his pipe from
his button-hole, and slowly filled it, and began to smoke.
“Is he dead?” I asked, after a silence.
“Is who dead, dear boy?”
“Compeyson.”
“He hopes I am, if he’s alive, you may be sure,” with a fierce look.
“I never heerd no more of him.”
Herbert had been writing with his pencil in the cover of a book.
He softly pushed the book over to me, as Provis stood smoking with
his eyes on the fire, and I read in it:
“Young Havisham’s name was Arthur. Compeyson is the man who professed to be Miss Havisham’s lover.”
I shut the book and nodded slightly to Herbert, and put the book
322 Great Expectations
by; but we neither of us said anything, and both looked at Provis as
he stood smoking by the fire.
CHAPTER IV
Why should I pause to ask how much of my shrinking from Provis
might be traced to Estella? Why should I loiter on my road, to
compare the state of mind in which I had tried to rid myself of the
stain of the prison before meeting her at the coach-office, with the
state of mind in which I now reflected on the abyss between Estella
in her pride and beauty, and the returned transport whom I harboured? The road would be none the smoother for it, the end would
be none the better for it, he would not be helped, nor I extenuated.
A new fear had been engendered in my mind by his narrative; or
rather, his narrative had given form and purpose to the fear that was
already there. If Compeyson were alive and should discover his
return, I could hardly doubt the consequence. That, Compeyson
stood in mortal fear of him, neither of the two could know much
better than I; and that, any such man as that man had been described
to be, would hesitate to release himself for good from a dreaded
enemy by the safe means of becoming an informer, was scarcely to be
imagined.
Never had I breathed, and never would I breathe––or so I
resolved––a word of Estella to Provis. But, I said to Herbert that
before I could go abroad, I must see both Estella and Miss Havisham.
This was when we were left alone on the night of the day when
Provis told us his story. I resolved to go out to Richmond next day,
and I went.
On my presenting myself at Mrs. Brandley’s, Estella’s maid was
called to tell me that Estella had gone into the country. Where? To
Satis House, as usual. Not as usual, I said, for she had never yet gone
there without me; when was she coming back? There was an air of
reservation in the answer which increased my perplexity, and the
answer was, that her maid believed she was only coming back at all
for a little while. I could make nothing of this, except that it was
meant that I should make nothing of it, and I went home again in
complete discomfiture.
Another night-consultation with Herbert after Provis was gone
xliii] Volume III Chapter IV 323
home (I always took him home, and always looked well about me),
led us to the conclusion that nothing should be said about going
abroad until I came back from Miss Havisham’s. In the mean time,
Herbert and I were to consider separately what it would be best to
say; whether we should devise any pretence of being afraid that he
was under suspicious observation; or whether I, who had never
yet been abroad, should propose an expedition. We both knew that
I had but to propose anything, and he would consent. We agreed
that his remaining many days in his present hazard was not to be
thought of.
Next day, I had the meanness to feign that I was under a binding
promise to go down to Joe; but I was capable of almost any meanness
towards Joe or his name. Provis was to be strictly careful while I was
gone, and Herbert was to take the charge of him that I had taken. I
was to be absent only one night, and, on my return, the gratification
of his impatience for my starting as a gentleman on a greater scale,
was to be begun. It occurred to me then, and as I afterwards found to
Herbert also, that he might be best got away across the water, on that
pretence––as, to make purchases, or the like.
Having thus cleared the way for my expedition to Miss Havisham’s, I set off by the early morning coach before it was yet light,
and was out on the open country-road when the day came creeping
on, halting and whimpering and shivering, and wrapped in patches
of cloud and rags of mist, like a beggar. When we drove up to the
Blue Boar after a drizzly ride, whom should I see come out under the
gateway, toothpick in hand, to look at the coach, but Bentley
Drummle!
As he pretended not to see me, I pretended not to see him. It was a
very lame pretence on both sides; the lamer, because we both went
into the coffee-room, where he had just finished his breakfast, and
where I ordered mine. It was poisonous to me to see him in the town,
for I very well knew why he had come there.
Pretending to read a smeary newspaper long out of date, which
had nothing half so legible in its local news, as the foreign matter of
coffee, pickles, fish sauces, gravy, melted butter, and wine, with
which it was sprinkled all over, as if it had taken the measles in a
highly irregular form, I sat at my table while he stood before the fire.
By degrees it became an enormous injury to me that he stood by the
fire, and I got up, determined to have my share of it. I had to put my
324 Great Expectations
hand behind his legs for the poker when I went up to the fireplace to
stir the fire, but still pretended not to know him.
“Is this a cut?”* said Mr. Drummle.
“Oh!” said I, poker in hand; “it’s you, is it? How do you do? I was
wondering who it was, who kept the fire off.”
With that, I poked tremendously, and having done so, planted
myself side by side with Mr. Drummle, my shoulders squared and
my back to the fire.
“You have just come down?” said Mr. Drummle, edging me a little
away with his shoulder.
“Yes,” said I, edging him a little away with my shoulder.
“Beastly place,” said Drummle.––“Your part of the country, I
think?”
“Yes,” I assented. “I am told it’s very like your Shropshire.”*
“Not in the least like it,” said Drummle.
Here Mr. Drummle looked at his boots, and I looked at mine, and
then Mr. Drummle looked at my boots, and I looked at his.
“Have you been here long?” I asked, determined not to yield an
inch of the fire.
“Long enough to be tired of it,” returned Drummle, pretending
to yawn, but equally determined.
“Do you stay here long?”
“Can’t say,” answered Drummle. “Do you?”
“Can’t say,” said I.
I felt here, through a tingling in my blood, that if Mr. Drummle’s
shoulder had claimed another hair’s breadth of room, I should have
jerked him into the window; equally, that if my own shoulder had
urged a similar claim, Mr. Drummle would have jerked me into the
nearest box. He whistled a little. So did I.
“Large tract of marshes about here, I believe?” said Drummle.
“Yes. What of that?” said I.
Mr. Drummle looked at me, and then at my boots, and then said,
“Oh!” and laughed.
“Are you amused, Mr. Drummle?”
“No,” said he, “not particularly. I am going out for a ride in the
saddle. I mean to explore those marshes for amusement. Out-of-theway villages there, they tell me. Curious little public-houses––and
smithies––and that. Waiter!”
“Yes, sir.”
xliii] Volume III Chapter IV 325
“Is that horse of mine ready?”
“Brought round to the door, sir.”
“I say. Look here, you sir. The lady won’t ride to-day; the weather
won’t do.”
“Very good, sir.”
“And I don’t dine, because I’m going to dine at the lady’s.”
“Very good, sir.”
Then, Drummle glanced at me, with an insolent triumph on his
great-jowled face that cut me to the heart, dull as he was, and so
exasperated me, that I felt inclined to take him in my arms (as the
robber in the story-book is said to have taken the old lady*), and seat
him on the fire.
One thing was manifest to both of us, and that was, that until
relief came, neither of us could relinquish the fire. There we stood,
well squared up before it, shoulder to shoulder and foot to foot, with
our hands behind us, not budging an inch. The horse was visible
outside in the drizzle at the door, my breakfast was put on the table,
Drummle’s was cleared away, the waiter invited me to begin, I nodded, we both stood our ground.
“Have you been to the Grove since?” said Drummle.
“No,” said I, “I had quite enough of the Finches the last time I
was there.”
“Was that when we had a difference of opinion?”
“Yes,” I replied, very shortly.
“Come, come! They let you off easily enough,” sneered
Drummle. “You shouldn’t have lost your temper.”
“Mr. Drummle,” said I, “you are not competent to give advice on
that subject. When I lose my temper (not that I admit having done so
on that occasion), I don’t throw glasses.”
“I do,” said Drummle.
After glancing at him once or twice, in an increased state of
smouldering ferocity, I said:
“Mr. Drummle, I did not seek this conversation, and I don’t think
it an agreeable one.”
“I am sure it’s not,” said he, superciliously over his shoulder; “I
don’t think anything about it.”
“And therefore,” I went on, “with your leave, I will suggest that
we hold no kind of communication in future.”
“Quite my opinion,” said Drummle, “and what I should have
326 Great Expectations
suggested myself, or done––more likely––without suggesting. But
don’t lose your temper. Haven’t you lost enough without that?”
“What do you mean, sir?”
“Wai-ter!” said Drummle, by way of answering me.
The waiter appeared.
“Look here, you sir. You quite understand that the young lady
don’t ride to-day, and that I dine at the young lady’s?”
“Quite so, sir.”
When the waiter had felt my fast-cooling tea-pot with the palm of
his hand, and had looked imploringly at me, and had gone out,
Drummle, careful not to move the shoulder next me, took a cigar
from his pocket and bit the end off, but showed no sign of stirring.
Choking and boiling as I was, I felt that we could not go a word
further, without introducing Estella’s name, which I could not
endure to hear him utter; and therefore I looked stonily at the opposite wall, as if there were no one present, and forced myself to silence.
How long we might have remained in this ridiculous position it is
impossible to say, but for the incursion of three thriving farmers––
laid on by the waiter, I think––who came into the coffee-room
unbuttoning their great-coats and rubbing their hands, and before
whom, as they charged at the fire, we were obliged to give way.
I saw him through the window, seizing his horse’s mane, and
mounting in his blundering brutal manner, and sidling and backing
away. I thought he was gone, when he came back, calling for a light
for the cigar in his mouth, which he had forgotten. A man in a dustcoloured dress appeared with what was wanted––I could not have
said from where: whether from the inn yard, or the street, or where
not––and as Drummle leaned down from the saddle and lighted his
cigar and laughed, with a jerk of his head towards the coffee-room
windows, the slouching shoulders and ragged hair of this man,
whose back was towards me, reminded me of Orlick.
Too heavily out of sorts to care much at the time whether it were
he or no, or after all to touch the breakfast, I washed the weather and
the journey from my face and hands, and went out to the memorable
old house that it would have been so much the better for me never to
have entered, never to have seen.
xliii] Volume III Chapter IV 327
CHAPTER V
In the room where the dressing-table stood, and where the wax
candles burnt on the wall, I found Miss Havisham and Estella; Miss
Havisham seated on a settee near the fire, and Estella on a cushion at
her feet. Estella was knitting, and Miss Havisham was looking on.
They both raised their eyes as I went in, and both saw an alteration
in me. I derived that, from the look they interchanged.
“And what wind,” said Miss Havisham, “blows you here,* Pip?”
Though she looked steadily at me, I saw that she was rather confused. Estella, pausing for a moment in her knitting with her eyes
upon me, and then going on, I fancied that I read in the action of her
fingers, as plainly as if she told me in the dumb alphabet, that she
perceived I had discovered my real benefactor.
“Miss Havisham,” said I, “I went to Richmond yesterday, to speak
to Estella; and finding that some wind had blown her here, I
followed.”
Miss Havisham motioning to me for the third or fourth time to sit
down, I took the chair by the dressing-table, which I had often seen
her occupy. With all that ruin at my feet and about me, it seemed a
natural place for me, that day.
“What I had to say to Estella, Miss Havisham, I will say before
you, presently––in a few moments. It will not surprise you, it will
not displease you. I am as unhappy as you can ever have meant me to
be.”
Miss Havisham continued to look steadily at me. I could see in the
action of Estella’s fingers as they worked, that she attended to what I
said: but she did not look up.
“I have found out who my patron is. It is not a fortunate discovery,
and is not likely ever to enrich me in reputation, station, fortune,
anything. There are reasons why I must say no more of that. It is not
my secret, but another’s.”
As I was silent for a while, looking at Estella and considering
how to go on, Miss Havisham repeated, “It is not your secret, but
another’s. Well?”
“When you first caused me to be brought here, Miss Havisham;
when I belonged to the village over yonder, that I wish I had never
left; I suppose I did really come here, as any other chance boy might
328 Great Expectations
have come––as a kind of servant, to gratify a want or a whim, and to
be paid for it?”
“Ay, Pip,” replied Miss Havisham, steadily nodding her head;
“you did.”
“And that Mr. Jaggers––––”
“Mr. Jaggers,” said Miss Havisham, taking me up in a firm tone,
“had nothing to do with it, and knew nothing of it. His being my
lawyer, and his being the lawyer of your patron, is a coincidence. He
holds the same relation towards numbers of people, and it might
easily arise. Be that as it may, it did arise, and was not brought about
by any one.”
Any one might have seen in her haggard face that there was no
suppression or evasion so far.
“But when I fell into the mistake I have so long remained in, at
least you led me on?” said I.
“Yes,” she returned, again nodding steadily, “I let you go on.”
“Was that kind?”
“Who am I,” cried Miss Havisham, striking her stick upon the
floor and flashing into wrath so suddenly that Estella glanced up at
her in surprise, “who am I, for God’s sake, that I should be kind!”
It was a weak complaint to have made, and I had not meant to
make it. I told her so, as she sat brooding after this outburst.
“Well, well, well!” she said. “What else?”
“I was liberally paid for my old attendance here,” I said, to soothe
her, “in being apprenticed, and I have asked these questions only for
my own information. What follows has another (and I hope more
disinterested) purpose. In humouring my mistake, Miss Havisham,
you punished––practised on––perhaps you will supply whatever
term expresses your intention, without offence––your self-seeking
relations?”
“I did. Why, they would have it so! So would you. What has been
my history, that I should be at the pains of entreating either them, or
you, not to have it so! You made your own snares. I never made
them.”
Waiting until she was quiet again––for this, too, flashed out of her
in a wild and sudden way––I went on.
“I have been thrown among one family of your relations, Miss
Havisham, and have been constantly among them since I went to
London. I know them to have been as honestly under my delusion as
xliv] Volume III Chapter V 329
I myself. And I should be false and base if I did not tell you, whether
it is acceptable to you or no, and whether you are inclined to give
credence to it or no, that you deeply wrong both Mr. Matthew
Pocket and his son Herbert, if you suppose them to be otherwise
than generous, upright, open, and incapable of anything designing or
mean.”
“They are your friends,” said Miss Havisham.
“They made themselves my friends,” said I, “when they supposed me to have superseded them; and when Sarah Pocket,
Miss Georgiana, and Mistress Camilla, were not my friends, I
think.”
This contrasting of them with the rest seemed, I was glad to see,
to do them good with her. She looked at me keenly for a little while,
and then said quietly:
“What do you want for them?”
“Only,” said I, “that you would not confound them with the
others. They may be of the same blood, but, believe me, they are not
of the same nature.”
Still looking at me keenly, Miss Havisham repeated:
“What do you want for them?”
“I am not so cunning, you see,” I said, in answer, conscious that I
reddened a little, “as that I could hide from you, even if I desired,
that I do want something. Miss Havisham, if you would spare the
money to do my friend Herbert a lasting service in life, but which
from the nature of the case must be done without his knowledge, I
could show you how.”
“Why must it be done without his knowledge?” she asked, settling
her hands upon her stick, that she might regard me the more
attentively.
“Because,” said I, “I began the service myself, more than two
years ago, without his knowledge, and I don’t want to be betrayed.
Why I fail in my ability to finish it, I cannot explain. It is a part of the
secret which is another person’s and not mine.”
She gradually withdrew her eyes from me, and turned them on
the fire. After watching it for what appeared in the silence and by the
light of the slowly wasting candles to be a long time, she was roused
by the collapse of some of the red coals, and looked towards me
again––at first, vacantly––then, with a gradually concentrating
attention. All this time, Estella knitted on. When Miss Havisham
330 Great Expectations
had fixed her attention on me, she said, speaking as if there had been
no lapse in our dialogue:
“What else?”
“Estella,” said I, turning to her now, and trying to command my
trembling voice, “you know I love you. You know that I have loved
you long and dearly.”
She raised her eyes to my face, on being thus addressed, and her
fingers plied their work, and she looked at me with an unmoved
countenance. I saw that Miss Havisham glanced from me to her, and
from her to me.
“I should have said this sooner, but for my long mistake. It
induced me to hope that Miss Havisham meant us for one another.
While I thought you could not help yourself, as it were, I refrained
from saying it. But I must say it now.”
Preserving her unmoved countenance, and with her fingers still
going, Estella shook her head.
“I know,” said I, in answer to that action; “I know. I have no hope
that I shall ever call you mine, Estella. I am ignorant what may
become of me very soon, how poor I may be, or where I may go. Still,
I love you. I have loved you ever since I first saw you in this house.”
Looking at me perfectly unmoved and with her fingers busy, she
shook her head again.
“It would have been cruel in Miss Havisham, horribly cruel, to
practise on the susceptibility of a poor boy, and to torture me
through all these years with a vain hope and an idle pursuit, if she
had reflected on the gravity of what she did. But I think she did not.
I think that in the endurance of her own trial, she forgot mine,
Estella.”
I saw Miss Havisham put her hand to her heart and hold it there,
as she sat looking by turns at Estella and at me.
“It seems,” said Estella, very calmly, “that there are sentiments,
fancies––I don’t know how to call them––which I am not able to
comprehend. When you say you love me, I know what you mean, as a
form of words; but nothing more. You address nothing in my breast,
you touch nothing there. I don’t care for what you say at all. I have
tried to warn you of this; now, have I not?”
I said in a miserable manner, “Yes.”
“Yes. But you would not be warned, for you thought I did not
mean it. Now, did you not think so?”
xliv] Volume III Chapter V 331
“I thought and hoped you could not mean it. You, so young,
untried, and beautiful, Estella! Surely it is not in Nature.”
“It is in my nature,” she returned. And then she added, with a
stress upon the words, “It is in the nature formed within me. I make
a great difference between you and all other people when I say so
much. I can do no more.”
“Is it not true,” said I, “that Bentley Drummle is in town here,
and pursuing you?”
“It is quite true,” she replied, referring to him with the indifference of utter contempt.
“That you encourage him, and ride out with him, and that he
dines with you this very day?”
She seemed a little surprised that I should know it, but again
replied, “Quite true.”
“You cannot love him, Estella!”
Her fingers stopped for the first time, as she retorted rather
angrily. “What have I told you? Do you still think, in spite of it, that I
do not mean what I say?”
“You would never marry him, Estella?”
She looked towards Miss Havisham, and considered for a moment
with her work in her hands. Then she said, “Why not tell you the
truth? I am going to be married to him.”
I dropped my face into my hands, but was able to control myself
better than I could have expected, considering what agony it gave me
to hear her say those words. When I raised my face again, there was
such a ghastly look upon Miss Havisham’s, that it impressed me,
even in my passionate hurry and grief.
“Estella, dearest dearest Estella, do not let Miss Havisham lead
you into this fatal step. Put me aside for ever––you have done so, I
well know––but bestow yourself on some worthier person than
Drummle. Miss Havisham gives you to him, as the greatest slight
and injury that could be done to the many far better men who admire
you, and to the few who truly love you. Among those few, there may
be one who loves you as dearly, though he has not loved you as long,
as I. Take him, and I can bear it better, for your sake!”
My earnestness awoke a wonder in her that seemed as if it would
have been touched with compassion, if she could have rendered me
at all intelligible to her own mind.
“I am going,” she said again, in a gentler voice, “to be married to
332 Great Expectations
him. The preparations for my marriage are making, and I shall be
married soon. Why do you injuriously introduce the name of my
mother by adoption? It is my own act.”
“Your own act, Estella, to fling yourself away upon a brute?”
“On whom should I fling myself away?” she retorted, with a
smile. “Should I fling myself away upon the man who would the
soonest feel (if people do feel such things) that I took nothing to
him? There! It is done. I shall do well enough, and so will my
husband. As to leading me into what you call this fatal step, Miss
Havisham would have had me wait, and not marry yet; but I am
tired of the life I have led, which has very few charms for me, and
I am willing enough to change it. Say no more. We shall never
understand each other.”
“Such a mean brute, such a stupid brute!” I urged in despair.
“Don’t be afraid of my being a blessing to him,” said Estella; “I
shall not be that. Come! Here is my hand. Do we part on this, you
visionary boy––––or man?”
“O Estella!” I answered, as my bitter tears fell fast on her hand, do
what I would to restrain them; “even if I remained in England and
could hold my head up with the rest, how could I see you Drummle’s
wife!”
“Nonsense,” she returned, “nonsense. This will pass in no time.”
“Never, Estella!”
“You will get me out of your thoughts in a week.”
“Out of my thoughts! You are part of my existence, part of myself.
You have been in every line I have ever read, since I first came here,
the rough common boy whose poor heart you wounded even then.
You have been in every prospect I have ever seen since––on the river,
on the sails of the ships, on the marshes, in the clouds, in the light, in
the darkness, in the wind, in the woods, in the sea, in the streets. You
have been the embodiment of every graceful fancy that my mind has
ever become acquainted with. The stones of which the strongest
London buildings are made, are not more real, or more impossible to
be displaced by your hands, than your presence and influence have
been to me, there and everywhere, and will be. Estella, to the last
hour of my life, you cannot choose but remain part of my character,
part of the little good in me, part of the evil. But, in this separation I
associate you only with the good, and I will faithfully hold you to
that always, for you must have done me far more good than harm, let
xliv] Volume III Chapter V 333
me feel now what sharp distress I may. O God bless you, God forgive
you!”
In what ecstasy of unhappiness I got these broken words out of
myself, I don’t know. The rhapsody welled up within me, like blood
from an inward wound, and gushed out. I held her hand to my lips
some lingering moments, and so I left her. But ever afterwards, I
remembered––and soon afterwards with stronger reason––that
while Estella looked at me merely with incredulous wonder, the
spectral figure of Miss Havisham, her hand still covering her heart,
seemed all resolved into a ghastly stare of pity and remorse.
All done, all gone! So much was done and gone, that when I went
out at the gate, the light of the day seemed of a darker colour than
when I went in. For a while, I hid myself among some lanes and bypaths, and then struck off to walk all the way to London.* For, I had
by that time come to myself so far, as to consider that I could not go
back to the inn and see Drummle there; that I could not bear to sit
upon the coach and be spoken to; that I could do nothing half so
good for myself as tire myself out.
It was past midnight when I crossed London Bridge. Pursuing the
narrow intricacies of the streets which at that time tended westward
near the Middlesex shore of the river, my readiest access to the
Temple was close by the river-side, through Whitefriars. I was not
expected till to-morrow, but I had my keys, and, if Herbert were
gone to bed, could get to bed myself without disturbing him.
As it seldom happened that I came in at that Whitefriars gate after
the Temple was closed, and as I was very muddy and weary, I did not
take it ill that the night-porter examined me with much attention as
he held the gate a little way open for me to pass in. To help his
memory I mentioned my name.
“I was not quite sure, sir, but I thought so. Here’s a note, sir. The
messenger that brought it, said would you be so good as read it by
my lantern.”
Much surprised by the request, I took the note. It was directed to
Philip Pip, Esquire, and on the top of the superscription were the
words, “Please read this, here.” I opened it, the watchman
holding up his light, and read inside, in Wemmick’s writing:
“Don’t go home.”
334 Great Expectations
CHAPTER VI
Turning from the Temple gate as soon as I had read the warning,
I made the best of my way to Fleet-street, and there got a late
hackney chariot and drove to the Hummums* in Covent Garden. In
those times a bed was always to be got there any hour of the night,
and the chamberlain, letting me in at his ready wicket, lighted the
candle next in order on his shelf, and showed me straight into
the bedroom next in order on his list. It was a sort of vault on the
ground floor at the back, with a despotic monster of a four-post
bedstead in it, straddling over the whole place, putting one of his
arbitrary legs into the fireplace and another into the doorway, and
squeezing the wretched little washing-stand in quite a Divinely
Righteous manner.*
As I had asked for a night-light, the chamberlain had brought me
in, before he left me, the good old constitutional rush-light* of those
virtuous days––an object like the ghost of a walking-cane, which
instantly broke its back if it were touched, which nothing could ever
be lighted at, and which was placed in solitary confinement at the
bottom of a high tin tower, perforated with round holes that made a
staringly wide-awake pattern on the walls. When I had got into bed,
and lay there footsore, weary, and wretched, I found that I could no
more close my own eyes than I could close the eyes of this foolish
Argus.* And thus, in the gloom and death of the night, we stared at
one another.
What a doleful night! How anxious, how dismal, how long! There
was an inhospitable smell in the room, of cold soot and hot dust; and,
as I looked up into the corners of the tester over my head, I thought
what a number of bluebottle flies from the butchers’, and earwigs
from the market, and grubs from the country, must be holding on up
there, lying by for next summer. This led me to speculate whether
any of them ever tumbled down, and then I fancied that I felt light
falls on my face––a disagreeable turn of thought, suggesting other
and more objectionable approaches up my back. When I had lain
awake a little while, those extraordinary voices with which silence
teems, began to make themselves audible. The closet whispered, the
fireplace sighed, the little washing-stand ticked, and one guitarstring played occasionally in the chest of drawers. At about the same
xlv] Volume III Chapter VI 335
time, the eyes on the wall acquired a new expression, and in every
one of those staring rounds I saw written, Don’t go home.
Whatever night-fancies and night-noises crowded on me, they
never warded off this Don’t go home. It plaited itself into whatever I thought of, as a bodily pain would have done. Not long before,
I had read in the newspapers, how a gentleman unknown had come
to the Hummums in the night, and had gone to bed, and had destroyed himself, and had been found in the morning weltering in
blood. It came into my head that he must have occupied this very
vault of mine, and I got out of bed to assure myself that there were
no red marks about; then opened the door to look out into the passages, and cheer myself with the companionship of a distant light,
near which I knew the chamberlain to be dozing. But all this time,
why I was not to go home, and what had happened at home, and
when I should go home, and whether Provis was safe at home, were
questions occupying my mind so busily, that one might have supposed there could be no more room in it for any other theme. Even
when I thought of Estella, and how we had parted that day for ever,
and when I recalled all the circumstances of our parting, and all her
looks and tones, and the action of her fingers while she knitted––
even then I was pursuing, here and there and everywhere, the caution Don’t go home. When at last I dozed, in sheer exhaustion of
mind and body, it became a vast shadowy verb which I had to conjugate. Imperative mood, present tense: Do not thou go home, let him
not go home, let us not go home, do not ye or you go home, let not
them go home. Then, potentially: I may not and I cannot go home;
and I might not, could not, would not, and should not go home; until
I felt that I was going distracted, and rolled over on the pillow, and
looked at the staring rounds upon the wall again.
I had left directions that I was to be called at seven; for it was plain
that I must see Wemmick before seeing any one else, and equally
plain that this was a case in which his Walworth sentiments, only,
could be taken. It was a relief to get out of the room where the night
had been so miserable, and I needed no second knocking at the door
to startle me from my uneasy bed.
The Castle battlements arose upon my view at eight o’clock. The
little servant happening to be entering the fortress with two hot rolls,
I passed through the postern and crossed the drawbridge, in her
company, and so came without announcement into the presence of
336 Great Expectations
Wemmick as he was making tea for himself and the Aged. An open
door afforded a perspective view of the Aged in bed.
“Halloa, Mr. Pip!” said Wemmick. “You did come home, then?”
“Yes,” I returned; “but I didn’t go home.”
“That’s all right,” said he, rubbing his hands. “I left a note for you
at each of the Temple gates,* on the chance. Which gate did you
come to?”
I told him.
“I’ll go round to the others in the course of the day and destroy
the notes,” said Wemmick; “it’s a good rule never to leave documentary evidence if you can help it, because you don’t know when it
may be put in. I’m going to take a liberty with you.––Would you
mind toasting this sausage for the Aged P.?”
I said I should be delighted to do it.
“Then you can go about your work, Mary Anne,” said Wemmick
to the little servant; “which leaves us to ourselves, don’t you see, Mr.
Pip?” he added, winking, as she disappeared.
I thanked him for his friendship and caution, and our discourse
proceeded in a low tone, while I toasted the Aged’s sausage and he
buttered the crumb of the Aged’s roll.
“Now, Mr. Pip, you know,” said Wemmick, “you and I understand
one another. We are in our private and personal capacities, and we
have been engaged in a confidential transaction before to-day.
Official sentiments are one thing. We are extra official.”
I cordially assented. I was so very nervous, that I had already
lighted the Aged’s sausage like a torch, and been obliged to blow it
out.
“I accidentally heard, yesterday morning,” said Wemmick, “being
in a certain place where I once took you––even between you and me,
it’s as well not to mention names when avoidable––––”
“Much better not,” said I. “I understand you.”
“I heard there by chance, yesterday morning,” said Wemmick,
“that a certain person not altogether of uncolonial pursuits, and not
unpossessed of portable property––I don’t know who it may really
be––we won’t name this person––––”
“Not necessary,” said I.
“––had made some little stir in a certain part of the world where a
good many people go, not always in gratification of their own inclinations, and not quite irrespective of the government expense––––”
xlv] Volume III Chapter VI 337
In watching his face, I made quite a firework of the Aged’s
sausage, and greatly discomposed both my own attention and
Wemmick’s; for which I apologised.
“––by disappearing from such place, and being no more heard of
thereabouts. From which,” said Wemmick, “conjectures had been
raised and theories formed. I also heard that you at your chambers in
Garden-court, Temple, had been watched, and might be watched
again.”
“By whom?” said I.
“I wouldn’t go into that,” said Wemmick, evasively, “it might
clash with official responsibilities. I heard it, as I have in my time
heard other curious things in the same place. I don’t tell it you on
information received. I heard it.”
He took the toasting-fork and sausage from me as he spoke, and
set forth the Aged’s breakfast neatly on a little tray. Previous to
placing it before him, he went into the Aged’s room with a clean
white cloth, and tied the same under the old gentleman’s chin, and
propped him up, and put his nightcap on one side, and gave him
quite a rakish air. Then, he placed his breakfast before him with
great care, and said, “All right, ain’t you, Aged P.?” To which the
cheerful Aged replied, “All right, John, my boy, all right!” As there
seemed to be a tacit understanding that the Aged was not in a presentable state, and was therefore to be considered invisible, I made a
pretence of being in complete ignorance of these proceedings.
“This watching of me at my chambers (which I have once had
reason to suspect),” I said to Wemmick when he came back, “is
inseparable from the person to whom you have adverted; is it?”
Wemmick looked very serious. “I couldn’t undertake to say that,
of my own knowledge. I mean, I couldn’t undertake to say it was at
first. But it either is, or it will be, or it’s in great danger of being.”
As I saw he was restrained by fealty to Little Britain from saying
as much as he could, and as I knew with thankfulness to him how far
out of his way he went to say what he did, I could not press him. But
I told him, after a little meditation over the fire, that I would like to
ask him a question, subject to his answering or not answering, as he
deemed right, and sure that his course would be right. He paused in
his breakfast, and crossing his arms, and pinching his shirt-sleeves
(his notion of in-door comfort was to sit without any coat), he nodded to me once, to put my question.
338 Great Expectations
“You have heard of a man of bad character, whose true name is
Compeyson?”
He answered with one other nod.
“Is he living?”
One other nod.
“Is he in London?”
He gave me one other nod, compressed the post-office exceedingly, gave me one last nod, and went on with his breakfast.
“Now,” said Wemmick, “questioning being over;” which he
emphasised and repeated for my guidance; “I come to what I did,
after hearing what I heard. I went to Garden-court to find you; not
finding you, I went to Clarriker’s to find Mr. Herbert.”
“And him you found?” said I, with great anxiety.
“And him I found. Without mentioning any names or going into
any details, I gave him to understand that if he was aware of
anybody––Tom, Jack, or Richard––being about the chambers, or
about the immediate neighbourhood, he had better get Tom, Jack, or
Richard, out of the way while you were out of the way.”
“He would be greatly puzzled what to do?”
“He was puzzled what to do; not the less, because I gave him my
opinion that it was not safe to try to get Tom, Jack, or Richard, too
far out of the way at present. Mr. Pip, I’ll tell you something. Under
existing circumstances there is no place like a great city when you are
once in it. Don’t break cover too soon. Lie close. Wait till things
slacken, before you try the open, even for foreign air.”
I thanked him for his valuable advice, and asked him what Herbert
had done?
“Mr. Herbert,” said Wemmick, “after being all of a heap for half
an hour, struck out a plan. He mentioned to me as a secret, that he is
courting a young lady who has, as no doubt you are aware, a bedridden Pa. Which Pa, having been in the Purser line of life, lies a-bed in
a bow-window where he can see the ships sail up and down the river.
You are acquainted with the young lady, most probably?”
“Not personally,” said I.
The truth was, that she had objected to me as an expensive companion who did Herbert no good, and that, when Herbert had first
proposed to present me to her, she had received the proposal with
such very moderate warmth, that Herbert had felt himself obliged to
confide the state of the case to me, with a view to the lapse of a little
xlv] Volume III Chapter VI 339
time before I made her acquaintance. When I had begun to advance
Herbert’s prospects by stealth, I had been able to bear this with
cheerful philosophy; he and his affianced, for their part, had naturally not been very anxious to introduce a third person into their
interviews; and thus, although I was assured that I had risen in
Clara’s esteem, and although the young lady and I had long regularly
interchanged messages and remembrances by Herbert, I had never
seen her. However, I did not trouble Wemmick with these particulars.
“The house with the bow-window,” said Wemmick, “being by the
river-side, down the Pool* there between Limehouse and Greenwich, and being kept, it seems, by a very respectable widow who has
a furnished upper floor to let, Mr. Herbert put it to me, what did I
think of that as a temporary tenement for Tom, Jack, or Richard?
Now, I thought very well of it, for three reasons I’ll give you. That is
to say. Firstly. It’s altogether out of all your beats, and is well away
from the usual heap of streets great and small. Secondly. Without
going near it yourself, you could always hear of the safety of Tom,
Jack, or Richard, through Mr. Herbert. Thirdly. After a while and
when it might be prudent, if you should want to slip Tom, Jack, or
Richard, on board a foreign packet-boat,* there he is––ready.”
Much comforted by these considerations, I thanked Wemmick
again and again, and begged him to proceed.
“Well, sir! Mr. Herbert threw himself into the business with a
will, and by nine o’clock last night he housed Tom, Jack or
Richard––whichever it may be––you and I don’t want to know––
quite successfully. At the old lodgings it was understood that he was
summoned to Dover, and in fact he was taken down the Dover road
and cornered out of it. Now, another great advantage of all this, is,
that it was done without you, and when, if any one was concerning
himself about your movements, you must be known to be ever so
many miles off and quite otherwise engaged. This diverts suspicion
and confuses it; and for the same reason I recommended that even if
you came back last night, you should not go home. It brings in more
confusion, and you want confusion.”
Wemmick, having finished his breakfast, here looked at his watch,
and began to get his coat on.
“And now, Mr. Pip,” said he, with his hands still in the sleeves, “I
have probably done the most I can do; but if I can ever do more––
from a Walworth point of view, and in a strictly private and personal
340 Great Expectations
capacity––I shall be glad to do it. Here’s the address. There can be
no harm in your going here to-night and seeing for yourself that all is
well with Tom, Jack, or Richard, before you go home––which is
another reason for your not going home last night. But after you have
gone home, don’t go back here. You are very welcome, I am sure, Mr.
Pip;” his hands were now out of his sleeves, and I was shaking them:
“and let me finally impress one important point upon you.” He laid
his hands upon my shoulders, and added in a solemn whisper: “Avail
yourself of this evening to lay hold of his portable property. You
don’t know what may happen to him. Don’t let anything happen to
the portable property.”
Quite despairing of making my mind clear to Wemmick at this
point, I forbore to try.
“Time’s up,” said Wemmick, “and I must be off. If you had nothing more pressing to do than keep here till dark, that’s what I should
advise. You look very much worried, and it would do you good to
have a perfectly quiet day with the Aged––he’ll be up presently––
and a little bit of––––you remember the pig?”
“Of course,” said I.
“Well; and a little bit of him. That sausage you toasted was his, and
he was in all respects a first-rater. Do try him, if it is only for old
acquaintance sake. Good-by, Aged Parent!” in a cheery shout.
“All right, John; all right, my boy!” piped the old man from
within.
I soon fell asleep before Wemmick’s fire, and the Aged and I
enjoyed one another’s society by falling asleep before it more or less
all day. We had loin of pork for dinner, and greens grown on the
estate, and I nodded at the Aged with a good intention whenever I
failed to do it drowsily. When it was quite dark, I left the Aged
preparing the fire for toast; and I inferred from the number of teacups, as well as from his glances at the two little doors in the wall,
that Miss Skiffins was expected.
CHAPTER VII
Eight o ’clock had struck before I got into the air that was scented, not disagreeably, by the chips and shavings of the long-shore
boat-builders, and mast oar and block makers. All that water-side
xlvi] Volume III Chapter VII 341
region of the upper and lower Pool below Bridge, was unknown
ground to me, and when I struck down by the river, I found that the
spot I wanted was not where I had supposed it to be, and was anything but easy to find. It was called Mill Pond Bank, Chinks’s Basin;
and I had no other guide to Chinks’s Basin than the Old Green
Copper Rope-Walk.*
It matters not what stranded ships repairing in dry docks I lost
myself among, what old hulls of ships in course of being knocked to
pieces, what ooze and slime and other dregs of tide, what yards of
ship-builders and ship-breakers, what rusty anchors blindly biting
into the ground though for years off duty, what mountainous country of accumulated casks and timber, how many rope-walks that were
not the Old Green Copper. After several times falling short of my
destination and as often over-shooting it, I came unexpectedly round
a corner, upon Mill Pond Bank. It was a fresh kind of place, all
circumstances considered, where the wind from the river had room
to turn itself round; and there were two or three trees in it, and there
was the stump of a ruined windmill, and there was the Old Green
Copper Rope-Walk––whose long and narrow vista I could trace in
the moonlight, along a series of wooden frames set in the ground,
that looked like superannuated haymaking-rakes which had grown
old and lost most of their teeth.
Selecting from the few queer houses upon Mill Pond Bank, a
house with a wooden front and three stories of bow-window (not
bay-window,* which is another thing), I looked at the plate upon the
door, and read there, Mrs. Whimple. That being the name I wanted,
I knocked, and an elderly woman of a pleasant and thriving appearance responded. She was immediately deposed, however, by Herbert, who silently led me into the parlour and shut the door. It was an
odd sensation to see his very familiar face established quite at home in
that very unfamiliar room and region; and I found myself looking
at him, much as I looked at the corner-cupboard with the glass
and china, the shells upon the chimney-piece, and the coloured
engravings on the wall, representing the death of Captain Cook, a
ship-launch, and his Majesty King George the Third* in a statecoachman’s wig, leather-breeches, and top-boots, on the terrace at
Windsor.
“All is well, Handel,” said Herbert, “and he is quite satisfied,
though eager to see you. My dear girl is with her father; and if you’ll
342 Great Expectations
wait till she comes down, I’ll make you known to her, and then we’ll
go upstairs.––––That’s her father.”
I had become aware of an alarming growling overhead, and had
probably expressed the fact in my countenance.
“I am afraid he is a sad old rascal,” said Herbert, smiling, “but I
have never seen him. Don’t you smell rum? He is always at it.”
“At rum?” said I.
“Yes,” returned Herbert “and you may suppose how mild it makes
his gout. He persists, too, in keeping all the provisions up-stairs in
his room, and serving them out. He keeps them on shelves over his
head, and will weigh them all. His room must be like a chandler’s
shop.”*
While he thus spoke, the growling noise became a prolonged roar,
and then died away.
“What else can be the consequence,” said Herbert, in explanation,
“if he will cut the cheese? A man with the gout in his right hand––
and everywhere else––can’t expect to get through a Double Gloucester without hurting himself.”
He seemed to have hurt himself very much, for he gave another
furious roar.
“To have Provis for an upper lodger is quite a godsend to Mrs.
Whimple,” said Herbert, “for of course people in general won’t
stand that noise. A curious place, Handel; isn’t it?”
It was a curious place, indeed; but remarkably well kept and clean.
“Mrs. Whimple,” said Herbert, when I told him so, “is the best of
housewives, and I really do not know what my Clara would do without her motherly help. For, Clara has no mother of her own, Handel,
and no relation in the world but old Gruffandgrim.”
“Surely that’s not his name, Herbert?”
“No, no,” said Herbert, “that’s my name for him. His name is Mr.
Barley. But what a blessing it is for the son of my father and mother,
to love a girl who has no relations, and who can never bother herself,
or anybody else, about her family!”
Herbert had told me on former occasions, and now reminded me,
that he first knew Miss Clara Barley when she was completing her
education at an establishment at Hammersmith, and that on her
being recalled home to nurse her father, he and she had confided
their affection to the motherly Mrs. Whimple, by whom it had been
fostered and regulated with equal kindness and discretion, ever
xlvi] Volume III Chapter VII 343
since. It was understood that nothing of a tender nature could possibly be confided to old Barley, by reason of his being totally unequal
to the consideration of any subject more psychological than Gout,
Rum, and Purser’s stores.
As we were thus conversing in a low tone while Old Barley’s
sustained growl vibrated in the beam that crossed the ceiling, the
room door opened, and a very pretty slight dark-eyed girl of twenty
or so, came in with a basket in her hand: whom Herbert tenderly
relieved of the basket, and presented blushing, as “Clara.” She really
was a most charming girl, and might have passed for a captive fairy,
whom that truculent Ogre, Old Barley, had pressed into his service.
“Look here,” said Herbert, showing me the basket, with a compassionate and tender smile after we had talked a little; “here’s poor
Clara’s supper, served out every night. Here’s her allowance of
bread, and here’s her slice of cheese, and here’s her rum––which I
drink. This is Mr. Barley’s breakfast for to-morrow, served out to be
cooked. Two mutton chops, three potatoes, some split peas, a little
flour, two ounces of butter, a pinch of salt, and all this black pepper.
It’s stewed up together, and taken hot, and it’s a nice thing for the
gout, I should think!”
There was something so natural and winning in Clara’s resigned
way of looking at these stores in detail, as Herbert pointed them
out,––and something so confiding, loving, and innocent, in her modest manner of yielding herself to Herbert’s embracing arm––and
something so gentle in her, so much needing protection on Mill
Pond Bank, by Chinks’s Basin, and the Old Green Copper RopeWalk, with Old Barley growling in the beam––that I would not have
undone the engagement between her and Herbert, for all the money
in the pocket-book I had never opened.
I was looking at her with pleasure and admiration, when suddenly
the growl swelled into a roar again, and a frightful bumping noise
was heard above, as if a giant with a wooden leg were trying to bore it
through the ceiling to come at us. Upon this Clara said to Herbert,
“Papa wants me, darling!” and ran away.
“There is an unconscionable old shark for you!” said Herbert.
“What do you suppose he wants now, Handel?”
“I don’t know,” said I. “Something to drink?”
“That’s it!” cried Herbert, as if I had made a guess of extraordinary merit. “He keeps his grog* ready-mixed in a little tub on the
344 Great Expectations
table. Wait a moment, and you’ll hear Clara lift him up to take
some.––There he goes!” Another roar, with a prolonged shake at the
end. “Now,” said Herbert, as it was succeeded by silence, “he’s
drinking. Now,” said Herbert, as the growl resounded in the beam
once more, “he’s down again on his back!”
Clara returned soon afterwards, and Herbert accompanied me upstairs to see our charge. As we passed Mr. Barley’s door, he was heard
hoarsely muttering within, in a strain that rose and fell like wind, the
following Refrain; in which I substitute good wishes for something
quite the reverse.
“Ahoy! Bless your eyes, here’s old Bill Barley. Here’s old Bill
Barley, bless your eyes. Here’s old Bill Barley on the flat of his back,
by the Lord. Lying on the flat of his back, like a drifting old dead
flounder, here’s your old Bill Barley, bless your eyes. Ahoy! Bless
you.’’
In this strain of consolation, Herbert informed me the invisible
Barley would commune with himself by the day and night together;
often while it was light, having, at the same time, one eye at a telescope which was fitted on his bed for the convenience of sweeping
the river.
In his two cabin rooms at the top of the house, which were fresh
and airy, and in which Mr. Barley was less audible than below, I
found Provis comfortably settled. He expressed no alarm, and
seemed to feel none that was worth mentioning; but it struck me that
he was softened––indefinably, for I could not have said how, and
could never afterwards recal how when I tried; but certainly.
The opportunity that the day’s rest had given me for reflection,
had resulted in my fully determining to say nothing to him respecting Compeyson. For anything I knew, his animosity towards the man
might otherwise lead to his seeking him out and rushing on his own
destruction. Therefore, when Herbert and I sat down with him by
his fire, I asked him first of all whether he relied on Wemmick’s
judgment and sources of information?
“Ay, ay, dear boy!” he answered, with a grave nod, “Jaggers’s
knows.”
“Then, I have talked with Wemmick,” said I, “and have come to
tell you what caution he gave me and what advice.”
This I did accurately, with the reservation just mentioned; and I
told him how Wemmick had heard, in Newgate prison (whether
xlvi] Volume III Chapter VII 345
from officers or prisoners I could not say), that he was under some
suspicion, and that my chambers had been watched; how Wemmick
had recommended his keeping close for a time, and my keeping away
from him; and what Wemmick had said about getting him abroad. I
added, that of course, when the time came, I should go with him, or
should follow close upon him, as might be safest in Wemmick’s
judgment. What was to follow that, I did not touch upon; neither
indeed was I at all clear or comfortable about it in my own mind, now
that I saw him in that softer condition, and in declared peril for my
sake. As to altering my way of living, by enlarging my expenses, I put
it to him whether in our present unsettled and difficult circumstances, it would not be simply ridiculous, if it were no worse?
He could not deny this, and indeed was very reasonable throughout. His coming back was a venture, he said, and he had always
known it to be a venture. He would do nothing to make it a desperate
venture, and he had very little fear of his safety with such good help.
Herbert, who had been looking at the fire and pondering, here said
that something had come into his thoughts arising out of Wemmick’s
suggestion, which it might be worth while to pursue. “We are both
good watermen, Handel, and could take him down the river ourselves when the right time comes. No boat would then be hired for
the purpose, and no boatmen; that would save at least a chance of
suspicion, and any chance is worth saving. Never mind the season;
don’t you think it might be a good thing if you began at once to keep
a boat at the Temple stairs,* and were in the habit of rowing up and
down the river? You fall into the habit, and then who notices or
minds? Do it twenty or fifty times, and there is nothing special in
your doing it the twenty-first or fifty-first.”
I liked this scheme, and Provis was quite elated by it. We agreed
that it should be carried into execution, and that Provis should never
recognise us if we came below Bridge and rowed past Mill Pond
Bank. But, we further agreed that he should pull down the blind in
that part of his window which gave upon the east, whenever he saw
us and all was right.
Our conference being now ended, and everything agreed, I rose to
go; remarking to Herbert that he and I had better not go home
together, and that I would take half an hour’s start of him. “I don’t
like to leave you here,” I said to Provis, “though I cannot doubt your
being safer here than near me. Good-by!”
346 Great Expectations
“Dear boy,” he answered, clasping my hands, “I don’t know when
we may meet again, and I don’t like Good-by. Say Good Night!”
“Good-night! Herbert will go regularly between us, and when the
time comes you may be certain I shall be ready. Good night, Good
night!”
We thought it best that he should stay in his own rooms, and we
left him on the landing outside his door, holding a light over the
stair-rail to light us down stairs. Looking back at him, I thought of
the first night of his return when our positions were reversed, and
when I little supposed my heart could ever be as heavy and anxious
at parting from him as it was now.
Old Barley was growling and swearing when we repassed his door,
with no appearance of having ceased or of meaning to cease. When
we got to the foot of the stairs, I asked Herbert whether he had
preserved the name of Provis? He replied, certainly not, and that the
lodger was Mr. Campbell. He also explained that the utmost known
of Mr. Campbell there, was, that he (Herbert) had Mr. Campbell
consigned to him, and felt a strong personal interest in his being well
cared for, and living a secluded life. So, when we went into the
parlour where Mrs. Whimple and Clara were seated at work, I said
nothing of my own interest in Mr. Campbell, but kept it to myself.
When I had taken leave of the pretty gentle dark-eyed girl, and of
the motherly woman who had not outlived her honest sympathy with
a little affair of true love, I felt as if the Old Green Copper RopeWalk had grown quite a different place. Old Barley might be as old as
the hills, and might swear like a whole field of troopers, but there
were redeeming youth and trust and hope enough in Chinks’s Basin
to fill it to overflowing. And then I thought of Estella, and of our
parting, and went home very sadly.
All things were as quiet in the Temple as ever I had seen them.
The windows of the rooms on that side, lately occupied by Provis,
were dark and still, and there was no lounger in Garden-court. I
walked past the fountain twice or thrice before I descended the steps
that were between me and my rooms, but I was quite alone. Herbert
coming by my bedside when he came in––for I went straight to bed,
dispirited and fatigued––made the same report. Opening one of the
windows after that, he looked out into the moonlight, and told me
that the pavement was as solemnly empty as the pavement of any
Cathedral at that same hour.
xlvi] Volume III Chapter VII 347
Next day, I set myself to get the boat. It was soon done, and the
boat was brought round to the Temple-stairs, and lay where I could
reach her within a minute or two. Then, I began to go out as for
training and practice: sometimes alone, sometimes with Herbert. I
was often out in cold, rain, and sleet, but nobody took much note of
me after I had been out a few times. At first, I kept above Blackfriars
Bridge; but as the hours of the tide changed, I took towards London
Bridge. It was Old London Bridge* in those days, and at certain
states of the tide there was a race and a fall of water there which gave
it a bad reputation. But I knew well enough how to “shoot” the
bridge after seeing it done, and so began to row about among the
shipping in the Pool, and down to Erith. The first time I passed Mill
Pond Bank, Herbert and I were pulling a pair of oars; and, both in
going and returning, we saw the blind towards the east come down.
Herbert was rarely there less frequently than three times a week, and
he never brought me a single word of intelligence that was at all
alarming. Still, I knew that there was cause for alarm, and I could not
get rid of the notion of being watched. Once received, it is a haunting idea; how many undesigning persons I suspected of watching
me, it would be hard to calculate.
In short, I was always full of fears for the rash man who was in
hiding. Herbert had sometimes said to me that he found it pleasant
to stand at one of our windows after dark, when the tide was running
down, and to think that it was flowing, with everything it bore,
towards Clara. But I thought with dread that it was flowing towards
Magwitch, and that any black mark on its surface might be his pursuers, going swiftly, silently, and surely, to take him.
CHAPTER VIII
Some weeks passed without bringing any change. We waited for
Wemmick, and he made no sign. If I had never known him out of
Little Britain, and had never enjoyed the privilege of being on a
familiar footing at the Castle, I might have doubted him; not so for a
moment, knowing him as I did.
My worldly affairs began to wear a gloomy appearance, and I was
pressed for money by more than one creditor. Even I myself began to
know the want of money (I mean of ready money in my own pocket),
348 Great Expectations
and to relieve it by converting some easily spared articles of jewellery
into cash. But I had quite determined that it would be a heartless
fraud to take more money from my patron in the existing state of
my uncertain thoughts and plans. Therefore, I had sent him the
unopened pocket-book by Herbert, to hold in his own keeping, and I
felt a kind of satisfaction––whether it was a false kind or a true, I
hardly know––in not having profited by his generosity since his
revelation of himself.
As the time wore on, an impression settled heavily upon me that
Estella was married. Fearful of having it confirmed, though it was all
but a conviction, I avoided the newspapers, and begged Herbert (to
whom I had confided the circumstances of our last interview) never
to speak of her to me. Why I hoarded up this last wretched little rag
of the robe of hope that was rent and given to the winds, how do I
know! Why did you who read this, commit that not dissimilar
inconsistency of your own, last year, last month, last week?
It was an unhappy life that I lived, and its one dominant anxiety,
towering over all its other anxieties like a high mountain above a
range of mountains, never disappeared from my view. Still, no new
cause for fear arose. Let me start from my bed as I would, with the
terror fresh upon me that he was discovered; let me sit listening as I
would, with dread, for Herbert’s returning step at night, lest it should
be fleeter than ordinary, and winged with evil news; for all that, and
much more to like purpose, the round of things went on. Condemned
to inaction and a state of constant restlessness and suspense, I rowed
about in my boat, and waited, waited, waited, as I best could.
There were states of the tide when, having been down the river, I
could not get back through the eddy-chafed arches and starlings* of
old London Bridge; then, I left my boat at a wharf near the Custom
House,* to be brought up afterwards to the Temple stairs. I was not
averse to doing this, as it served to make me and my boat a commoner incident among the water-side people there. From this slight
occasion, sprang two meetings that I have now to tell of.
One afternoon, late in the month of February, I came ashore at the
wharf at dusk. I had pulled down as far as Greenwich with the ebb
tide, and had turned with the tide. It had been a fine bright day, but
had become foggy as the sun dropped, and I had had to feel my way
back among the shipping, pretty carefully. Both in going and returning, I had seen the signal in his window, All well.
xlvii] Volume III Chapter VIII 349
As it was a raw evening and I was cold, I thought I would comfort
myself with dinner at once; and as I had hours of dejection and
solitude before me if I went home to the Temple, I thought I would
afterwards go to the play. The theatre where Mr. Wopsle had
achieved his questionable triumph, was in that waterside neighbourhood (it is nowhere now), and to that theatre I resolved to go. I
was aware that Mr. Wopsle had not succeeded in reviving the
Drama, but, on the contrary, had rather partaken of its decline. He
had been ominously heard of, through the playbills, as a faithful
Black, in connexion with a little girl of noble birth, and a monkey.
And Herbert had seen him as a predatory Tartar of comic propensities, with a face like a red brick, and an outrageous hat all
over bells.*
I dined at what Herbert and I used to call a Geographical chophouse––where there were maps of the world in porter-pot rims on
every half-yard of the tablecloths, and charts of gravy on every one
of the knives––to this day there is scarcely a single chop-house within the Lord Mayor’s dominions which is not Geographical––and
wore out the time in dozing over crumbs, staring at gas, and baking
in a hot blast of dinners. By-and-by, I roused myself and went to the
play.
There, I found a virtuous boatswain in his Majesty’s service––a
most excellent man, though I could have wished his trousers not
quite so tight in some places and not quite so loose in others––who
knocked all the little men’s hats over their eyes, though he was very
generous and brave, and who wouldn’t hear of anybody’s paying
taxes, though he was very patriotic.* He had a bag of money in his
pocket, like a pudding in the cloth, and on that property married a
young person in bed-furniture,* with great rejoicings; the whole
population of Portsmouth (nine in number at the last Census) turning out on the beach, to rub their own hands and shake everybody
else’s, and sing “Fill, fill!”* A certain dark-complexioned Swab,*
however, who wouldn’t fill, or do anything else that was proposed to
him, and whose heart was openly stated (by the boatswain) to be as
black as his figure-head,* proposed to two other Swabs to get all
mankind into difficulties; which was so effectually done (the Swab
family having considerable political influence) that it took half the
evening to set things right, and then it was only brought about
through an honest little grocer with a white hat, black gaiters, and
350 Great Expectations
red nose, getting into a clock, with a gridiron, and listening, and
coming out, and knocking everybody down from behind with the
gridiron whom he couldn’t confute with what he had overheard.
This led to Mr. Wopsle’s (who had never been heard of before)
coming in with a star and garter* on, as a plenipotentiary of great
power direct from the Admiralty, to say that the Swabs were all to go
to prison on the spot, and that he had brought the boatswain down
the Union Jack, as a slight acknowledgment of his public services.
The boatswain, unmanned for the first time, respectfully dried his
eyes on the Jack, and then cheering up and addressing Mr. Wopsle as
Your Honour, solicited permission to take him by the fin. Mr.
Wopsle conceding his fin with a gracious dignity, was immediately
shoved into a dusty corner while everybody danced a hornpipe; and
from that corner, surveying the public with a discontented eye,
became aware of me.
The second piece was the last new grand comic Christmas pantomime, in the first scene of which, it pained me to suspect that I
detected Mr. Wopsle with red worsted legs under a highly magnified
phosphoric countenance and a shock of red curtain-fringe for his
hair, engaged in the manufacture of thunderbolts in a mine, and
displaying great cowardice when his gigantic master came home
(very hoarse) to dinner. But he presently presented himself under
worthier circumstances; for, the Genius of Youthful Love being in
want of assistance––on account of the parental brutality of an ignorant farmer who opposed the choice of his daughter’s heart, by purposely falling upon the object, in a flour sack, out of the first-floor
window––summoned a sententious Enchanter; and he, coming up
from the antipodes* rather unsteadily, after an apparently violent
journey, proved to be Mr. Wopsle in a high-crowned hat, with a
necromantic work in one volume under his arm. The business of this
enchanter on earth, being principally to be talked at, sung at, butted
at, danced at, and flashed at with fires of various colours, he had a
good deal of time on his hands. And I observed with great surprise,
that he devoted it to staring in my direction as if he were lost in
amazement.
There was something so remarkable in the increasing glare of Mr.
Wopsle’s eye, and he seemed to be turning so many things over in his
mind and to grow so confused, that I could not make it out. I sat
thinking of it, long after he had ascended to the clouds in a large
xlvii] Volume III Chapter VIII 351
watch-case,* and still I could not make it out. I was still thinking of it
when I came out of the theatre an hour afterwards, and found him
waiting for me near the door.
“How do you do?” said I, shaking hands with him as we turned
down the street together. “I saw that you saw me.”
“Saw you, Mr. Pip!” he returned. “Yes, of course I saw you. But
who else was there?”
“Who else?”
“It is the strangest thing,” said Mr. Wopsle, drifting into his lost
look again; “and yet I could swear to him.”
Becoming alarmed, I entreated Mr. Wopsle to explain his
meaning.
“Whether I should have noticed him at first but for your being
there,” said Mr. Wopsle, going on in the same lost way, “I can’t be
positive; yet I think I should.”
Involuntarily I looked round me, as I was accustomed to look
round me when I went home; for, these mysterious words gave me a
chill.
“Oh! He can’t be in sight,” said Mr. Wopsle. “He went out, before
I went off, I saw him go.”
Having the reason that I had, for being suspicious, I even suspected this poor actor. I mistrusted a design to entrap me into some
admission. Therefore, I glanced at him as we walked on together, but
said nothing.
“I had a ridiculous fancy that he must be with you, Mr. Pip, till I
saw that you were quite unconscious of him, sitting behind you
there, like a ghost.”
My former chill crept over me again, but I was resolved not to
speak yet, for it was quite consistent with his words that he might be
set on to induce me to connect these references with Provis. Of
course, I was perfectly sure and safe that Provis had not been there.
“I dare say you wonder at me, Mr. Pip; indeed I see you do. But it
is so very strange! You’ll hardly believe what I am going to tell you. I
could hardly believe it myself, if you told me.”
“Indeed?” said I.
“No, indeed. Mr. Pip, you remember in old times a certain
Christmas Day, when you were quite a child, and I dined at Gargery’s, and some soldiers came to the door to get a pair of handcuffs
mended?”
352 Great Expectations
“I remember it very well.”
“And you remember that there was a chase after two convicts, and
that we joined in it, and that Gargery took you on his back, and that I
took the lead and you kept up with me as well as you could?”
“I remember it all very well.” Better than he thought––except the
last clause.
“And you remember that we came up with the two in a ditch, and
that there was a scuffle between them, and that one of them had been
severely handled and much mauled about the face, by the other?”
“I see it all before me.”
“And that the soldiers lighted torches, and put the two in the
centre, and that we went on to see the last of them, over the black
marshes, with the torchlight shining on their faces––I am particular
about that; with the torchlight shining on their faces, when there was
an outer ring of dark night all about us?”
“Yes,” said I. “I remember all that.”
“Then, Mr. Pip, one of those two prisoners sat behind you tonight. I saw him over your shoulder.”
“Steady!” I thought. I asked him then, “Which of the two do you
suppose you saw?”
“The one who had been mauled,” he answered readily, “and I’ll
swear I saw him! The more I think of him, the more certain I am of
him.”
“This is very curious!” said I, with the best assumption I could
put on, of its being nothing more to me. “Very curious indeed!”
I cannot exaggerate the enhanced disquiet into which this conversation threw me, or the special and peculiar terror I felt at Compeyson’s having been behind me “like a ghost.” For, if he had ever been
out of my thoughts for a few moments together since the hiding had
begun, it was in those very moments when he was closest to me; and
to think that I should be so unconscious and off my guard after all
my care, was as if I had shut an avenue of a hundred doors to keep
him out, and then had found him at my elbow. I could not doubt
either that he was there, because I was there, and that however slight
an appearance of danger there might be about us, danger was always
near and active.
I put such questions to Mr. Wopsle as, When did the man come
in? He could not tell me that; he saw me, and over my shoulder he
saw the man. It was not until he had seen him for some time that he
xlvii] Volume III Chapter VIII 353
began to identify him; but he had from the first vaguely associated
him with me, and known him as somehow belonging to me in the old
village time. How was he dressed? Prosperously, but not noticeably
otherwise; he thought, in black. Was his face at all disfigured? No, he
believed not. I believed not, too, for, although in my brooding state I
had taken no especial notice of the people behind me, I thought it
likely that a face at all disfigured would have attracted my attention.
When Mr. Wopsle had imparted to me all that he could recal or I
extract, and when I had treated him to a little appropriate refreshment after the fatigues of the evening, we parted. It was between
twelve and one o’clock when I reached the Temple, and the gates
were shut. No one was near me when I went in and went home.
Herbert had come in, and we held a very serious council by the
fire. But there was nothing to be done, saving to communicate to
Wemmick what I had that night found out, and to remind him that
we waited for his hint. As I thought that I might compromise him if I
went too often to the Castle, I made this communication by letter. I
wrote it before I went to bed, and went out and posted it; and again
no one was near me. Herbert and I agreed that we could do nothing
else but be very cautious. And we were very cautious indeed––more
cautious than before, if that were possible––and I for my part never
went near Chinks’s Basin, except when I rowed by, and then I only
looked at Mill Pond Bank as I looked at anything else.
CHAPTER IX
The second of the two meetings referred to in the last chapter,
occurred about a week after the first. I had again left my boat at the
wharf below Bridge; the time was an hour earlier in the afternoon;
and, undecided where to dine, I had strolled up into Cheapside, and
was strolling along it, surely the most unsettled person in all the busy
concourse, when a large hand was laid upon my shoulder, by some
one overtaking me. It was Mr. Jaggers’s hand, and he passed it
through my arm.
“As we are going in the same direction, Pip, we may walk together.
Where are you bound for?”
“For the Temple, I think,” said I.
“Don’t you know?” said Mr. Jaggers.
354 Great Expectations
“Well,” I returned, glad for once to get the better of him in crossexamination, “I do not know, for I have not made up my mind.”
“You are going to dine?” said Mr. Jaggers. “You don’t mind
admitting that, I suppose?”
“No,” I returned, “I don’t mind admitting that.”
“And are not engaged?”
“I don’t mind admitting also, that I am not engaged.”
“Then,” said Mr. Jaggers, “come and dine with me.”
I was going to excuse myself, when he added, “Wemmick’s coming.” So, I changed my excuse into an acceptance––the few words I
had uttered, serving for the beginning of either––and we went along
Cheapside and slanted off to Little Britain, while the lights were
springing up brilliantly in the shop windows, and the street lamplighters, scarcely finding ground enough to plant their ladders on in
the midst of the afternoon’s bustle, were skipping up and down and
running in and out, opening more red eyes in the gathering fog than
my rush-light tower at the Hummums had opened white eyes in the
ghostly wall.
At the office in Little Britain there was the usual letter-writing,
hand-washing, candle-snuffing, and safe-locking, that closed the
business of the day. As I stood idle by Mr. Jaggers’s fire, its rising and
falling flame made the two casts on the shelf look as if they were
playing a diabolical game at bo-beep with me; while the pair of
coarse fat office candles that dimly lighted Mr. Jaggers as he wrote in
a corner, were decorated with dirty winding-sheets,* as if in remembrance of a host of hanged clients.
We went to Gerrard-street, all three together, in a hackney-coach:
and as soon as we got there, dinner was served. Although I should not
have thought of making, in that place, the most distant reference by
so much as a look to Wemmick’s Walworth sentiments, yet I should
have had no objection to catching his eye now and then in a friendly
way. But it was not to be done. He turned his eyes on Mr. Jaggers
when ever he raised them from the table, and was as dry and distant
to me as if there were twin Wemmicks and this was the wrong one.
“Did you send that note of Miss Havisham’s to Mr. Pip, Wemmick?” Mr. Jaggers asked, soon after we began dinner.
“No, sir,” returned Wemmick; “it was going by post, when you
brought Mr. Pip into the office. Here it is.” He handed it to his
principal, instead of to me.
xlviii] Volume III Chapter IX 355
“It’s a note of two lines, Pip,” said Mr. Jaggers, handing it on,
“sent up to me by Miss Havisham, on account of her not being sure
of your address. She tells me that she wants to see you on a little
matter of business you mentioned to her. You’ll go down?”
“Yes,” said I, casting my eyes over the note, which was exactly in
those terms.
“When do you think of going down?”
“I have an impending engagement,” said I, glancing at Wemmick,
who was putting fish into the post-office, “that renders me rather
uncertain of my time. At once, I think.”
“If Mr. Pip has the intention of going at once,” said Wemmick to
Mr. Jaggers, “he needn’t write an answer, you know.”
Receiving this as an intimation that it was best not to delay, I
settled that I would go to-morrow, and said so. Wemmick drank a
glass of wine and looked with a grimly satisfied air at Mr. Jaggers,
but not at me.
“So, Pip! Our friend the Spider,” said Mr. Jaggers, “has played his
cards. He has won the pool.”
It was as much as I could do to assent.
“Hah! He is a promising fellow––in his way––but he may not
have it all his own way. The stronger will win in the end, but the
stronger has to be found out first. If he should turn to, and beat
her––––”
“Surely,” I interrupted, with a burning face and heart, “you do
not seriously think that he is scoundrel enough for that, Mr.
Jaggers?”
“I didn’t say so, Pip. I am putting a case. If he should turn to and
beat her, he may possibly get the strength on his side; if it should be a
question of intellect, he certainly will not. It would be chance work
to give an opinion how a fellow of that sort will turn out in such
circumstances, because it’s a toss-up between two results.”
“May I ask what they are?”
“A fellow like our friend the Spider,” answered Mr. Jaggers,
“either beats, or cringes. He may cringe and growl, or cringe and not
growl; but he either beats or cringes. Ask Wemmick his opinion.”
“Either beats or cringes,” said Wemmick, not at all addressing
himself to me.
“So, here’s to Mrs. Bentley Drummle,” said Mr. Jaggers, taking a
decanter of choicer wine from his dumb-waiter, and filling for each
356 Great Expectations
of us and for himself, “and may the question of supremacy be settled
to the lady’s satisfaction! To the satisfaction of the lady and the
gentleman, it never will be. Now, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, how
slow you are to-day!”
She was at his elbow when he addressed her, putting a dish upon
the table. As she withdrew her hands from it, she fell back a step or
two, nervously muttering some excuse. And a certain action of her
fingers as she spoke arrested my attention.
“What’s the matter?” said Mr. Jaggers.
“Nothing. Only the subject we were speaking of,” said I, “was
rather painful to me.”
The action of her fingers was like the action of knitting. She stood
looking at her master, not understanding whether she was free to go,
or whether he had more to say to her and would call her back if she
did go. Her look was very intent. Surely, I had seen exactly such eyes
and such hands, on a memorable occasion very lately!
He dismissed her, and she glided out of the room. But she
remained before me, as plainly as if she were still there. I looked at
those hands, I looked at those eyes, I looked at that flowing hair; and
I compared them with other hands, other eyes, other hair, that I
knew of, and with what those might be after twenty years of a brutal
husband and a stormy life. I looked again at those hands and eyes of
the housekeeper, and thought of the inexplicable feeling that had
come over me when I last walked––not alone––in the ruined garden,
and through the deserted brewery. I thought how the same feeling
had come back when I saw a face looking at me, and a hand waving to
me, from a stage-coach window; and how it had come back again and
had flashed about me like Lightning, when I had passed in a
carriage––not alone––through a sudden glare of light in a dark
street. I thought how one link of association had helped that identification in the theatre, and how such a link, wanting before, had been
riveted for me now, when I had passed by a chance, swift from
Estella’s name to the fingers with their knitting action, and the attentive eyes. And I felt absolutely certain that this woman was Estella’s
mother.
Mr. Jaggers had seen me with Estella, and was not likely to have
missed the sentiments I had been at no pains to conceal. He nodded
when I said the subject was painful to me, clapped me on the back,
put round the wine again, and went on with his dinner.
xlviii] Volume III Chapter IX 357
Only twice more, did the housekeeper reappear, and then her stay
in the room was very short, and Mr. Jaggers was sharp with her. But
her hands were Estella’s hands, and her eyes were Estella’s eyes, and
if she had reappeared a hundred times I could have been neither
more sure nor less sure that my conviction was the truth.
It was a dull evening, for Wemmick drew his wine when it came
round, quite as a matter of business––just as he might have drawn
his salary when that came round––and with his eyes on his chief, sat
in a state of perpetual readiness for cross-examination. As to the
quantity of wine, his post-office was as indifferent and ready as any
other post-office for its quantity of letters. From my point of view, he
was the wrong twin all the time, and only externally like the Wemmick of Walworth.
We took our leave early, and left together. Even when we were
groping among Mr. Jaggers’s stock of boots for our hats, I felt that
the right twin was on his way back; and we had not gone half a dozen
yards down Gerrard-street in the Walworth direction before I found
that I was walking arm-in-arm with the right twin, and that the
wrong twin had evaporated into the evening air.
“Well!” said Wemmick, “that’s over! He’s a wonderful man, without his living likeness; but I feel that I have to screw myself up when
I dine with him––and I dine more comfortably unscrewed.”
I felt that this was a good statement of the case, and told him so.
“Wouldn’t say it to anybody but yourself,” he answered. “I know
that what is said between you and me, goes no further.”
I asked him if he had ever seen Miss Havisham’s adopted daughter, Mrs. Bentley Drummle? He said no. To avoid being too abrupt, I
then spoke of the Aged, and of Miss Skiffins. He looked rather sly
when I mentioned Miss Skiffins, and stopped in the street to blow
his nose, with a roll of the head and a flourish not quite free from
latent boastfulness.
“Wemmick,” said I, “do you remember telling me before I first
went to Mr. Jaggers’s private house, to notice that housekeeper?”
“Did I?” he replied. “Ah, I dare say I did. Deuce take me,” he
added, suddenly, “I know I did. I find I am not quite unscrewed yet.”
“A wild beast tamed, you called her.”
“And what do you call her?”
“The same. How did Mr. Jaggers tame her, Wemmick?”
“That’s his secret. She has been with him many a long year.”
358 Great Expectations
“I wish you would tell me her story. I feel a particular interest in
being acquainted with it. You know that what is said between you
and me goes no further.”
“Well!” Wemmick replied, “I don’t know her story––that is, I
don’t know all of it. But what I do know, I’ll tell you. We are in our
private and personal capacities, of course.”
“Of course.”
“A score or so of years ago, that woman was tried at the Old Bailey
for murder, and was acquitted. She was a very handsome young
woman, and I believe had some gipsy blood in her. Anyhow, it was
hot enough when it was up, as you may suppose.”
“But she was acquitted.”
“Mr. Jaggers was for her,” pursued Wemmick, with a look full of
meaning, “and worked the case in a way quite astonishing. It was a
desperate case, and it was comparatively early days with him then,
and he worked it to general admiration; in fact, it may almost be said
to have made him. He worked it himself at the police-office, day after
day for many days, contending against even a committal; and at the
trial where he couldn’t work it himself, sat under Counsel, and––
every one knew––put in all the salt and pepper. The murdered person was a woman; a woman, a good ten years older, very much larger,
and very much stronger. It was a case of jealousy. They both led
tramping lives, and this woman in Gerrard-street here had been
married very young, over the broomstick* (as we say), to a tramping
man, and was a perfect fury in point of jealousy. The murdered
woman––more a match for the man, certainly, in point of years––was
found dead in a barn near Hounslow Heath. There had been a violent struggle, perhaps a fight. She was bruised and scratched and
torn, and had been held by the throat at last and choked. Now, there
was no reasonable evidence to implicate any person but this woman,
and, on the improbabilities of her having been able to do it, Mr.
Jaggers principally rested his case. You may be sure,” said Wemmick,
touching me on the sleeve, “that he never dwelt upon the strength of
her hands then, though he sometimes does now.”
I had told Wemmick of his showing us her wrists, that day of the
dinner party.
“Well, sir!” Wemmick went on; “it happened––happened, don’t
you see?––that this woman was so very artfully dressed from the
time of her apprehension, that she looked much slighter than she
xlviii] Volume III Chapter IX 359
really was; in particular, her sleeves are always remembered to have
been so skilfully contrived that her arms had quite a delicate look.
She had only a bruise or two about her––nothing for a tramp––but
the backs of her hands were lacerated, and the question was, was it
with finger-nails? Now, Mr. Jaggers showed that she had struggled
through a great lot of brambles which were not as high as her face;
but which she could not have got through and kept her hands out of;
and bits of those brambles were actually found in her skin and put in
evidence, as well as the fact that the brambles in question were found
on examination to have been broken through, and to have little
shreds of her dress and little spots of blood upon them here and
there. But the boldest point he made, was this. It was attempted to be
set up in proof of her jealousy, that she was under strong suspicion
of having, at about the time of the murder, frantically destroyed her
child by this man––some three years old––to revenge herself upon
him. Mr. Jaggers worked that, in this way. ‘We say these are not
marks of finger-nails, but marks of brambles, and we show you the
brambles. You say they are marks of finger-nails, and you set up the
hypothesis that she destroyed her child. You must accept all consequences of that hypothesis. For anything we know, she may have
destroyed her child, and the child in clinging to her may have
scratched her hands. What then? You are not trying her for the
murder of her child; why don’t you? As to this case, if you will
have scratches, we say that, for anything we know, you may have
accounted for them, assuming for the sake of argument that you
have not invented them?’ To sum up, sir,” said Wemmick, “Mr.
Jaggers was altogether too many for the Jury, and they gave in.”
“Has she been in his service ever since?”
“Yes; but not only that,” said Wemmick. “She went into his service immediately after her acquittal, tamed as she is now. She has
since been taught one thing and another in the way of her duties, but
she was tamed from the beginning.”
“Do you remember the sex of the child?”
“Said to have been a girl.”
“You have nothing more to say to me to-night?”
“Nothing. I got your letter and destroyed it. Nothing.”
We exchanged a cordial Good Night, and I went home, with new
matter for my thoughts, though with no relief from the old.
360 Great Expectations
CHAPTER X
Putting Miss Havisham’s note in my pocket, that it might serve as
my credentials for so soon reappearing at Satis house, in case her
waywardness should lead her to express any surprise at seeing me, I
went down again by the coach next day. But, I alighted at the Halfway House, and breakfasted there, and walked the rest of the distance; for, I sought to get into the town quietly by the unfrequented
ways, and to leave it in the same manner.
The best light of the day was gone when I passed along the quiet
echoing courts behind the High-street. The nooks of ruin where the
old monks had once had their refectories and gardens, and where the
strong walls were now pressed into the service of humble sheds and
stables, were almost as silent as the old monks in their graves. The
cathedral chimes had at once a sadder and a more remote sound to
me, as I hurried on avoiding observation, than they had ever had
before; so, the swell of the old organ was borne to my ears like funeral
music; and the rooks, as they hovered about the grey tower and swung
in the bare high trees of the priory-garden, seemed to call to me that
the place was changed, and that Estella was gone out of it for ever.
An elderly woman whom I had seen before as one of the servants
who lived in the supplementary house across the back court-yard
opened the gate. The lighted candle stood in the dark passage within, as of old, and I took it up and ascended the staircase alone. Miss
Havisham was not in her own room, but was in the larger room
across the landing. Looking in at the door, after knocking in vain, I
saw her sitting on the hearth in a ragged chair, close before, and lost
in the contemplation of, the ashy fire.
Doing as I had often done, I went in, and stood, touching the old
chimney-piece, where she could see me when she raised her eyes.
There was an air of utter loneliness upon her, that would have moved
me to pity though she had wilfully done me a deeper injury than I
could charge her with. As I stood compassionating her, and thinking
how in the progress of time I too had come to be a part of the
wrecked fortunes of that house, her eyes rested on me. She stared,
and said in a low voice, “Is it real!”
“It is I, Pip. Mr. Jaggers gave me your note yesterday, and I have
lost no time.”
xlix] Volume III Chapter X 361
“Thank you. Thank you.”
As I brought another of the ragged chairs to the hearth and sat
down, I remarked a new expression on her face, as if she were afraid
of me.
“I want,” she said, “to pursue that subject you mentioned to me
when you were last here, and to show you that I am not all stone. But
perhaps you can never believe, now, that there is anything human in
my heart?”
When I said some reassuring words, she stretched out her tremulous right hand, as though she was going to touch me; but she
recalled it again before I understood the action, or knew how to
receive it.
“You said, speaking for your friend, that you could tell me how to
do something useful and good. Something that you would like done,
is it not?”
“Something that I would like done very much.”
“What is it?”
I began explaining to her that secret history of the partnership. I
had not got far into it, when I judged from her looks that she was
thinking in a discursive way of me, rather than of what I said. It
seemed to be so, for, when I stopped speaking, many moments
passed before she showed that she was conscious of the fact.
“Do you break off,” she asked then, with her former air of being
afraid of me, “because you hate me too much to bear to speak to
me?”
“No, no,” I answered, “how can you think so, Miss Havisham! I
stopped because I thought you were not following what I said.”
“Perhaps I was not,” she answered, putting a hand to her head.
“Begin again, and let me look at something else. Stay! Now tell
me.”
She set her hand upon her stick, in the resolute way that sometimes was habitual to her, and looked at the fire with a strong expression of forcing herself to attend. I went on with my explanation, and
told her how I had hoped to complete the transaction out of my
means, but how in this I was disappointed. That part of the subject (I
reminded her) involved matters which could form no part of my
explanation, for they were the weighty secrets of another.
“So!” said she, assenting with her head, but not looking at me.
“And how much money is wanting to complete the purchase?”
362 Great Expectations
I was rather afraid of stating it, for it sounded a large sum. “Nine
hundred pounds.”
“If I give you the money for this purpose, will you keep my secret
as you have kept your own?”
“Quite as faithfully.”
“And your mind will be more at rest?”
“Much more at rest.”
“Are you very unhappy now?”
She asked this question, still without looking at me, but in an
unwonted tone of sympathy. I could not reply at the moment, for my
voice failed me. She put her left arm across the head of her stick, and
softly laid her forehead on it.
“I am far from happy, Miss Havisham; but I have other causes of
disquiet than any you know of. They are the secrets I have
mentioned.”
After a little while, she raised her head and looked at the fire again.
“It is noble in you to tell me that you have other causes of unhappiness. Is it true?”
“Too true.”
“Can I only serve you, Pip, by serving your friend? Regarding that
as done, is there nothing I can do for you yourself ?”
“Nothing. I thank you for the question. I thank you even more for
the tone of the question. But, there is nothing.”
She presently rose from her seat, and looked about the blighted
room for the means of writing. There were none there, and she took
from her pocket a yellow set of ivory tablets,* mounted in tarnished
gold, and wrote upon them with a pencil in a case of tarnished gold
that hung from her neck.
“You are still on friendly terms with Mr. Jaggers?”
“Quite. I dined with him yesterday.”
“This is an authority to him to pay you that money, to lay out at
your irresponsible* discretion for your friend. I keep no money here;
but if you would rather Mr. Jaggers knew nothing of the matter, I
will send it to you.”
“Thank you, Miss Havisham; I have not the least objection to
receiving it from him.”
She read me what she had written, and it was direct and clear, and
evidently intended to absolve me from any suspicion of profiting by
the receipt of the money. I took the tablets from her hand, and it
xlix] Volume III Chapter X 363
trembled again, and it trembled more as she took off the chain to
which the pencil was attached, and put it in mine. All this she did,
without looking at me.
“My name is on the first leaf. If you can ever write under my
name, ‘I forgive her,’ though ever so long after my broken heart is
dust––pray do it!”
“O Miss Havisham,” said I, “I can do it now. There have been sore
mistakes; and my life has been a blind and thankless one; and I want
forgiveness and direction far too much, to be bitter with you.”
She turned her face to me for the first time since she had averted
it, and, to my amazement, I may even add to my terror, dropped on
her knees at my feet; with her folded hands raised to me in the
manner in which, when her poor heart was young and fresh and
whole, they must often have been raised to heaven from her mother’s
side.
To see her with her white hair and her worn face kneeling at my
feet, gave me a shock through all my frame. I entreated her to rise,
and got my arms about her to help her up; but she only pressed that
hand of mine which was nearest to her grasp, and hung her head over
it and wept. I had never seen her shed a tear before, and, in the hope
that the relief might do her good, I bent over her without speaking.
She was not kneeling now, but was down upon the ground.
“O!” she cried, despairingly. “What have I done! What have I
done!”
“If you mean, Miss Havisham, what have you done to injure me,
let me answer. Very little. I should have loved her under any
circumstances––Is she married?”
“Yes.”
It was a needless question, for a new desolation in the desolate
house had told me so.
“What have I done! What have I done!” She wrung her hands, and
crushed her white hair, and returned to this cry over and over again.
“What have I done!”
I knew not how to answer, or how to comfort her. That she had
done a grievous thing in taking an impressionable child to mould
into the form that her wild resentment, spurned affection, and
wounded pride, found vengeance in, I knew full well. But that, in
shutting out the light of day, she had shut out infinitely more; that, in
seclusion, she had secluded herself from a thousand natural and
364 Great Expectations
healing influences; that, her mind, brooding solitary, had grown diseased, as all minds do and must and will that reverse the appointed
order of their Maker; I knew equally well. And could I look upon her
without compassion, seeing her punishment in the ruin she was, in
her profound unfitness for this earth on which she was placed, in the
vanity of sorrow which had become a master mania, like the vanity of
penitence, the vanity of remorse, the vanity of unworthiness, and
other monstrous vanities that have been curses in this world?
“Until you spoke to her the other day, and until I saw in you a
looking-glass that showed me what I once felt myself, I did not know
what I had done. What have I done! What have I done!” And so
again, twenty, fifty times over, What had she done!
“Miss Havisham,” I said, when her cry had died away, “you may
dismiss me from your mind and conscience. But Estella is a different
case, and if you can ever undo any scrap of what you have done amiss
in keeping a part of her right nature away from her, it will be better
to do that, than to bemoan the past through a hundred years.”
“Yes, yes, I know it. But, Pip––my Dear!” There was an earnest
womanly compassion for me in her new affection. “My Dear! Believe
this: when she first came to me, I meant to save her from misery like
my own. At first I meant no more.”
“Well, well!” said I. “I hope so.”
“But as she grew, and promised to be very beautiful, I gradually did
worse, and with my praises, and with my jewels, and with my teachings, and with this figure of myself always before her a warning to back
and point my lessons, I stole her heart away and put ice in its place.”
“Better,” I could not help saying, “to have left her a natural heart,
even to be bruised or broken.”
With that, Miss Havisham looked distractedly at me for a while,
and then burst out again, What had she done!
“If you knew all my story,” she pleaded, “you would have some
compassion for me and a better understanding of me.”
“Miss Havisham,” I answered, as delicately as I could, “I believe I
may say that I do know your story, and have known it ever since I
first left this neighbourhood. It has inspired me with great commiseration, and I hope I understand it and its influences. Does what
has passed between us give me any excuse for asking you a question
relative to Estella? Not as she is, but as she was when she first came
here?”
xlix] Volume III Chapter X 365
She was seated on the ground, with her arms on the ragged chair,
and her head leaning on them. She looked full at me when I said this,
and replied, “Go on.”
“Whose child was Estella?”
She shook her head.
“You don’t know?”
She shook her head again.
“But Mr. Jaggers brought her here, or sent her here?”
“Brought her here.”
“Will you tell me how that came about?”
She answered in a low whisper and with caution: “I had been shut
up in these rooms a long time (I don’t know how long; you know
what time the clocks keep here), when I told him that I wanted a
little girl to rear and love, and save from my fate. I had first seen him
when I sent for him to lay this place waste for me; having read of him
in the newspapers, before I and the world parted. He told me that he
would look about for such an orphan child. One night he brought her
here asleep, and I called her Estella.”
“Might I ask her age then?”
“Two or three. She herself knows nothing, but that she was left an
orphan and I adopted her.”
So convinced I was of that woman’s being her mother, that I
wanted no evidence to establish the fact in my own mind. But, to any
mind, I thought, the connexion here was clear and straight.
What more could I hope to do by prolonging the interview? I had
succeeded on behalf of Herbert, Miss Havisham had told me all she
knew of Estella, I had said and done what I could to ease her mind.
No matter with what other words we parted; we parted.
Twilight was closing in when I went down stairs into the natural
air. I called to the woman who had opened the gate when I entered,
that I would not trouble her just yet, but would walk round the
place before leaving. For, I had a presentiment that I should never
be there again, and I felt that the dying light was suited to my last
view of it.
By the wilderness of casks that I had walked on long ago, and on
which the rain of years had fallen since, rotting them in many places,
and leaving miniature swamps and pools of water upon those that
stood on end, I made my way to the ruined garden. I went all round
it; round by the corner where Herbert and I had fought our battle;
366 Great Expectations
round by the paths where Estella and I had walked. So cold, so
lonely, so dreary all!
Taking the brewery on my way back, I raised the rusty latch of a
little door at the garden end of it, and walked through. I was going
out at the opposite door––not easy to open now, for the damp wood
had started and swelled, and the hinges were yielding, and the
threshold was encumbered with a growth of fungus––when I turned
my head to look back. A childish association revived with wonderful
force in the moment of the slight action, and I fancied that I saw
Miss Havisham hanging to the beam. So strong was the impression,
that I stood under the beam shuddering from head to foot before I
knew it was a fancy––though to be sure I was there in an instant.
The mournfulness of the place and time, and the great terror of
this illusion, though it was momentary, caused me to feel an
indescribable awe as I came out between the open wooden gates
where I had once wrung my hair after Estella had wrung my heart.
Passing on into the front court-yard, I hesitated whether to call the
woman to let me out at the locked gate of which she had the key, or
first to go upstairs and assure myself that Miss Havisham was as safe
and well as I had left her. I took the latter course and went up.
I looked into the room where I had left her, and I saw her seated in
the ragged chair upon the hearth close to the fire, with her back
towards me. In the moment when I was withdrawing my head to go
quietly away, I saw a great flaming light spring up. In the same
moment, I saw her running at me, shrieking, with a whirl of fire
blazing all about her, and soaring at least as many feet above her head
as she was high.
I had a double-caped great-coat on, and over my arm another
thick coat. That I got them off, closed with her, threw her down, and
got them over her; that I dragged the great cloth from the table for
the same purpose, and with it dragged down the heap of rottenness
in the midst, and all the ugly things that sheltered there; that we
were on the ground struggling like desperate enemies, and that the
closer I covered her, the more wildly she shrieked and tried to free
herself; that this occurred I knew through the result, but not through
anything I felt, or thought, or knew I did. I knew nothing until I
knew that we were on the floor by the great table, and that patches of
tinder yet were floating in the smoky air, which, a moment ago, had
been her faded bridal dress.
xlix] Volume III Chapter X 367
Then, I looked round and saw the disturbed beetles and spiders
running away over the floor, and the servants coming in with breathless cries at the door. I still held her forcibly down with all my
strength, like a prisoner who might escape; and I doubt if I even
knew who she was, or why we had struggled, or that she had been in
flames, or that the flames were out, until I saw the patches of tinder
that had been her garments, no longer alight but falling in a black
shower around us.
She was insensible, and I was afraid to have her moved, or even
touched. Assistance was sent for and I held her until it came, as if I
unreasonably fancied (I think I did) that if I let her go, the fire would
break out again and consume her. When I got up, on the surgeon’s
coming to her with other aid, I was astonished to see that both my
hands were burnt; for, I had no knowledge of it through the sense of
feeling.
On examination it was pronounced that she had received serious
hurts, but that they of themselves were far from hopeless; the danger
lay mainly in the nervous shock. By the surgeon’s directions, her bed
was carried into that room and laid upon the great table: which
happened to be well suited to the dressing of her injuries. When I
saw her again, an hour afterwards, she lay indeed where I had seen
her strike her stick, and had heard her say that she would lie one day.
Though every vestige of her dress was burnt, as they told me, she
still had something of her old ghastly bridal appearance; for, they
had covered her to the throat with white cotton-wool, and as she lay
with a white sheet loosely overlying that, the phantom air of something that had been and was changed, was still upon her.
I found, on questioning the servants, that Estella was in Paris, and
I got a promise from the surgeon that he would write to her by the
next post. Miss Havisham’s family I took upon myself; intending to
communicate with Mr. Matthew Pocket only, and leave him to do as
he liked about informing the rest. This I did next day, through
Herbert, as soon as I returned to town.
There was a stage, that evening, when she spoke collectedly of
what had happened, though with a certain terrible vivacity. Towards
midnight she began to wander in her speech, and after that it gradually set in that she said innumerable times in a low solemn voice,
“What have I done!” And then, “When she first came, I meant to
save her from misery like mine.” And then, “Take the pencil and
368 Great Expectations
write under my name, ‘I forgive her!’ ” She never changed the order
of these three sentences, but she sometimes left out a word in one or
other of them; never putting in another word, but always leaving a
blank and going on to the next word.
As I could do no service there, and as I had, nearer home, that
pressing reason for anxiety and fear which even her wanderings
could not drive out of my mind, I decided in the course of the night
that I would return by the early morning coach: walking on a mile or
so, and being taken up clear of the town. At about six o’clock of the
morning, therefore, I leaned over her and touched her lips with
mine, just as they said, not stopping for being touched, “Take the
pencil and write under my name, ‘I forgive her.’ ”
CHAPTER XI
My hands had been dressed twice or thrice in the night, and again
in the morning. My left arm was a good deal burned to the elbow,
and, less severely, as high as the shoulder; it was very painful, but the
flames had set in that direction, and I felt thankful it was no worse.
My right hand was not so badly burnt but that I could move the
fingers. It was bandaged, of course, but much less inconveniently
than my left hand and arm; those I carried in a sling; and I could only
wear my coat like a cloak, loose over my shoulders and fastened at the
neck. My hair had been caught by the fire, but not my head or face.
When Herbert had been down to Hammersmith and seen his
father, he came back to me at our chambers, and devoted the day to
attending on me. He was the kindest of nurses, and at stated times
took off the bandages, and steeped them in the cooling liquid that
was kept ready, and put them on again, with a patient tenderness
that I was deeply grateful for.
At first, as I lay quiet on the sofa, I found it painfully difficult, I
might say impossible, to get rid of the impression of the glare of the
flames, their hurry and noise, and the fierce burning smell. If I dozed
for a minute, I was awakened by Miss Havisham’s cries, and by her
running at me with all that height of fire above her head. This pain
of the mind was much harder to strive against than any bodily pain I
suffered; and Herbert, seeing that, did his utmost to hold my attention engaged.
l] Volume III Chapter XI 369
Neither of us spoke of the boat, but we both thought of it.
That was made apparent by our avoidance of the subject, and
by our agreeing––without agreement––to make my recovery of
the use of my hands, a question of so many hours, not of so many
weeks.
My first question when I saw Herbert had been of course, whether
all was well down the river? As he replied in the affirmative, with
perfect confidence and cheerfulness, we did not resume the subject
until the day was wearing away. But then, as Herbert changed the
bandages, more by the light of the fire than by the outer light, he
went back to it spontaneously.
“I sat with Provis last night, Handel, two good hours.”
“Where was Clara?”
“Dear little thing!” said Herbert. “She was up and down with
Gruffandgrim all the evening. He was perpetually pegging at the
floor, the moment she left his sight. I doubt if he can hold out long
though. What with rum and pepper––and pepper and rum––I
should think his pegging must be nearly over.”
“And then you will be married, Herbert?”
“How can I take care of the dear child otherwise?––Lay your arm
out upon the back of the sofa, my dear boy, and I’ll sit down here,
and get the bandage off so gradually that you shall not know when it
comes. I was speaking of Provis. Do you know, Handel, he
improves?”
“I said to you I thought he was softened when I last saw him.”
“So you did. And so he is. He was very communicative last night,
and told me more of his life. You remember his breaking off here
about some woman that he had had great trouble with.––Did I hurt
you?”
I had started, but not under his touch. His words had given me a
start.
“I had forgotten that, Herbert, but I remember it now you speak
of it.”
“Well! He went into that part of his life, and a dark wild part it is.
Shall I tell you? Or would it worry you just now?”
“Tell me by all means. Every word.”
Herbert bent forward to look at me more nearly, as if my reply had
been rather more hurried or more eager than he could quite account
for. “Your head is cool?” he said, touching it.
370 Great Expectations
“Quite,” said I. “Tell me what Provis said, my dear Herbert.”
“It seems,” said Herbert, “––there’s a bandage off most charmingly, and now comes the cool one––makes you shrink at first, my
poor dear fellow, don’t it? but it will be comfortable presently––it
seems that the woman was a young woman, and a jealous woman,
and a revengeful woman; revengeful, Handel, to the last degree.”
“To what last degree?”
“Murder.––Does it strike too cold on that sensitive place?”
“I don’t feel it. How did she murder? Whom did she murder?”
“Why, the deed may not have merited quite so terrible a name,”
said Herbert, “but, she was tried for it, and Mr. Jaggers defended
her, and the reputation of that defence first made his name known to
Provis. It was another and a stronger woman who was the victim, and
there had been a struggle––in a barn. Who began it, or how fair it
was, or how unfair, may be doubtful; but how it ended, is certainly
not doubtful, for the victim was found throttled.”
“Was the woman brought in guilty?”
“No; she was acquitted.––My poor Handel, I hurt you!”
“It is impossible to be gentler, Herbert. Yes? What else?”
“This acquitted young woman and Provis,” said Herbert, “had a
little child: a little child of whom Provis was exceedingly fond. On
the evening of the very night when the object of her jealousy was
strangled as I tell you, the young woman presented herself before
Provis for one moment, and swore that she would destroy the child
(which was in her possession), and he should never see it again; then,
she vanished.––There’s the worst arm comfortably in the sling once
more, and now there remains but the right hand, which is a far easier
job. I can do it better by this light than by a stronger, for my hand is
steadiest when I don’t see the poor blistered patches too distinctly.––
You don’t think your breathing is affected, my dear boy? You seem to
breathe quickly.”
“Perhaps I do, Herbert. Did the woman keep her oath?”
“There comes the darkest part of Provis’s life. She did.”
“That is, he says she did.”
“Why, of course, my dear boy,” returned Herbert, in a tone of
surprise, and again bending forward to get a nearer look at me. “He
says it all. I have no other information.”
“No, to be sure.”
“Now, whether,” pursued Herbert, “he had used the child’s
l] Volume III Chapter XI 371
mother ill, or whether he had used the child’s mother well, Provis
doesn’t say; but, she had shared some four or five years of the
wretched life he described to us at this fireside, and he seems to have
felt pity for her, and forbearance towards her. Therefore, fearing he
should be called upon to depose about this destroyed child, and so
be the cause of her death, he hid himself (much as he grieved for the
child), kept himself dark, as he says, out of the way and out of the
trial, and was only vaguely talked of as a certain man called Abel, out
of whom the jealousy arose. After the acquittal she disappeared, and
thus he lost the child and the child’s mother.”
“I want to ask––––”
“A moment, my dear boy,” said Herbert, “and I have done. That
evil genius, Compeyson, the worst of scoundrels among many
scoundrels, knowing of his keeping out of the way at that time, and
of his reasons for doing so, of course afterwards held the knowledge
over his head as a means of keeping him poorer, and working him
harder. It was clear last night that this barbed the point of Provis’s
animosity.”
“I want to know,” said I, “and particularly, Herbert, whether he
told you when this happened?”
“Particularly? Let me remember, then, what he said as to that. His
expression was, ‘a round score o’ year ago, and a’most directly after I
took up wi’ Compeyson.’ How old were you when you came upon
him in the little churchyard?”
“I think in my seventh year.”
“Ay. It had happened some three or four years then, he said, and
you brought into his mind the little girl so tragically lost, who would
have been about your age.”
“Herbert,” said I, after a short silence, in a hurried way, “can you
see me best by the light of the window, or the light of the fire?”
“By the firelight,” answered Herbert, coming close again.
“Look at me.”
“I do look at you, my dear boy.”
“Touch me.”
“I do touch you, my dear boy.”
“You are not afraid that I am in any fever, or that my head is much
disordered by the accident of last night?”
“N-no, my dear boy,” said Herbert, after taking time to examine
me. “You are rather excited, but you are quite yourself.”
372 Great Expectations
“I know I am quite myself. And the man we have in hiding down
the river, is Estella’s Father.”
CHAPTER XII
What purpose I had in view when I was hot on tracing out and
proving Estella’s parentage, I cannot say. It will presently be seen
that the question was not before me in a distinct shape, until it was
put before me by a wiser head than my own.
But, when Herbert and I had held our momentous conversation, I
was seized with a feverish conviction that I ought to hunt the matter
down––that I ought not to let it rest, but that I ought to see Mr.
Jaggers, and come at the bare truth. I really do not know whether I
felt that I did this for Estella’s sake, or whether I was glad to transfer
to the man in whose preservation I was so much concerned, some
rays of the romantic interest that had so long surrounded her. Perhaps the latter possibility may be the nearer to the truth.
Any way, I could scarcely be withheld from going out to Gerrardstreet that night. Herbert’s representations that if I did, I should
probably be laid up and stricken useless, when our fugitive’s safety
would depend upon me, alone restrained my impatience. On the
understanding, again and again reiterated, that come what would, I
was to go to Mr. Jaggers to-morrow, I at length submitted to keep
quiet, and to have my hurts looked after, and to stay at home. Early
next morning we went out together, and at the corner of Giltspurstreet by Smithfield, I left Herbert to go his way into the City, and
took my way to Little Britain.
There were periodical occasions when Mr. Jaggers and Wemmick
went over the office accounts, and checked off the vouchers, and put
all things straight. On those occasions Wemmick took his books and
papers into Mr. Jaggers’s room, and one of the up-stairs clerks came
down into the outer office. Finding such clerk on Wemmick’s post
that morning, I knew what was going on; but, I was not sorry to have
Mr. Jaggers and Wemmick together, as Wemmick would then hear
for himself that I said nothing to compromise him.
My appearance with my arm bandaged and my coat loose over my
shoulders, favoured my object. Although I had sent Mr. Jaggers a
brief account of the accident as soon as I had arrived in town, yet I
li] Volume III Chapter XII 373
had to give him all the details now; and the speciality of the occasion
caused our talk to be less dry and hard, and less strictly regulated by
the rules of evidence, than it had been before. While I described the
disaster, Mr. Jaggers stood, according to his wont, before the fire.
Wemmick leaned back in his chair, staring at me, with his hands in
the pockets of his trousers, and his pen put horizontally into the
post. The two brutal casts, always inseparable in my mind from the
official proceedings, seemed to be congestively considering whether
they didn’t smell fire at the present moment.
My narrative finished, and their questions exhausted, I then produced Miss Havisham’s authority to receive the nine hundred
pounds for Herbert. Mr. Jaggers’s eyes retired a little deeper into his
head when I handed him the tablets, but he presently handed them
over to Wemmick, with instructions to draw the cheque for his signature. While that was in course of being done, I looked on at Wemmick as he wrote, and Mr. Jaggers, poising and swaying himself on
his well-polished boots, looked at me. “I am sorry, Pip,” said he, as I
put the cheque in my pocket, when he had signed it, “that we do
nothing for you.”
“Miss Havisham was good enough to ask me,” I returned,
“whether she could do nothing for me, and I told her No.”
“Everybody should know his own business,” said Mr Jaggers. And
I saw Wemmick’s lips form the words “portable property.”
“I should not have told her No, if I had been you,” said Mr.
Jaggers; “but every man ought to know his own business best.”
“Every man’s business,” said Wemmick, rather reproachfully,
towards me, “is portable property.”
As I thought the time was now come for pursuing the theme I had
at heart, I said, turning on Mr. Jaggers:
“I did ask something of Miss Havisham, however, sir. I asked her
to give me some information relative to her adopted daughter, and
she gave me all she possessed.”
“Did she?” said Mr. Jaggers, bending forward to look at his boots
and then straightening himself. “Hah! I don’t think I should have
done so, if I had been Miss Havisham. But she ought to know her
own business best.”
“I know more of the history of Miss Havisham’s adopted child,
than Miss Havisham herself does, sir. I know her mother.”
Mr. Jaggers looked at me inquiringly, and repeated “Mother?”
374 Great Expectations
“I have seen her mother within these three days.”
“Yes?” said Mr. Jaggers.
“And so have you, sir. And you have seen her still more recently.”
“Yes?” said Mr. Jaggers.
“Perhaps I know more of Estella’s history than even you do,” said
I. “I know her father too.”
A certain stop that Mr. Jaggers came to in his manner––he was too
self-possessed to change his manner, but he could not help its being
brought to an indefinably attentive stop––assured me that he did not
know who her father was. This I had strongly suspected from Provis’s account (as Herbert had repeated it) of his having kept himself
dark; which I pieced on to the fact that he himself was not Mr.
Jaggers’s client until some four years later, and when he could have
no reason for claiming his identity. But, I could not be sure of this
unconsciousness on Mr. Jaggers’s part before, though I was quite
sure of it now.
“So! You know the young lady’s father, Pip?” said Mr. Jaggers.
“Yes,” I replied, “And his name is Provis––from New South
Wales.”
Even Mr. Jaggers started when I said those words. It was the
slightest start that could escape a man, the most carefully repressed
and the soonest checked, but he did start, though he made it a part of
the action of taking out his pocket-handkerchief. How Wemmick
received the announcement I am unable to say, for I was afraid to
look at him just then, lest Mr. Jaggers’s sharpness should detect that
there had been some communication unknown to him between us.
“And on what evidence, Pip?” asked Mr. Jaggers, very coolly, as
he paused with his handkerchief half way to his nose, “does Provis
make this claim?”
“He does not make it,” said I, “and has never made it, and has no
knowledge or belief that his daughter is in existence.”
For once, the powerful pocket-handkerchief failed. My reply was
so unexpected that Mr. Jaggers put the handkerchief back into his
pocket without completing the usual performance, folded his arms,
and looked at me with stern attention, though with an immovable
face.
Then I told him all I knew, and how I knew it; with the one
reservation that I left him to infer that I knew from Miss Havisham
what I in fact knew from Wemmick. I was very careful indeed as to
li] Volume III Chapter XII 375
that. Nor, did I look towards Wemmick until I had finished all I had
to tell, and had been for some time silently meeting Mr. Jaggers’s
look. When I did at last turn my eyes in Wemmick’s direction, I
found that he had unposted his pen, and was intent upon the table
before him.
“Hah!” said Mr. Jaggers at last, as he moved towards the papers
on the table. “––What item was it you were at, Wemmick, when Mr.
Pip came in?”
But I could not submit to be thrown off in that way, and I made a
passionate, almost an indignant, appeal to him to be more frank and
manly with me. I reminded him of the false hopes into which I had
lapsed, the length of time they had lasted, and the discovery I had
made: and I hinted at the danger that weighed upon my spirits. I
represented myself as being surely worthy of some little confidence
from him, in return for the confidence I had just now imparted. I
said that I did not blame him, or suspect him, or mistrust him, but
I wanted assurance of the truth from him. And if he asked me why I
wanted it and why I thought I had any right to it, I would tell him,
little as he cared for such poor dreams, that I had loved Estella dearly
and long, and that, although I had lost her and must live a bereaved
life, whatever concerned her was still nearer and dearer to me than
anything else in the world. And seeing that Mr. Jaggers stood quite
still and silent, and apparently quite obdurate, under this appeal, I
turned to Wemmick, and said, “Wemmick, I know you to be a man
with a gentle heart. I have seen your pleasant home, and your old
father, and all the innocent cheerful playful ways with which you
refresh your business life. And I entreat you to say a word for me
to Mr. Jaggers, and to represent to him that, all circumstances
considered, he ought to be more open with me!”
I have never seen two men look more oddly at one another than
Mr. Jaggers and Wemmick did after this apostrophe. At first, a misgiving crossed me that Wemmick would be instantly dismissed from
his employment; but, it melted as I saw Mr. Jaggers relax into something like a smile, and Wemmick become bolder.
“What’s all this?” said Mr. Jaggers. “You with an old father, and
you with pleasant and playful ways?”
“Well!” returned Wemmick. “If I don’t bring ’em here, what does
it matter?”
“Pip,” said Mr. Jaggers, laying his hand upon my arm, and
376 Great Expectations
smiling openly, “this man must be the most cunning impostor in all
London.”
“Not a bit of it,” returned Wemmick, growing bolder and bolder.
“I think you’re another.”
Again they exchanged their former odd looks, each apparently still
distrustful that the other was taking him in.
“You with a pleasant home?” said Mr. Jaggers.
“Since it don’t interfere with business,” returned Wemmick, “let
it be so. Now, I look at you, sir, I shouldn’t wonder if you might be
planning and contriving to have a pleasant home of your own, one of
these days, when you’re tired of all this work.”
Mr. Jaggers nodded his head retrospectively two or three times,
and actually drew a sigh. “Pip,” said he, “we won’t talk about ‘poor
dreams;’ you know more about such things than I, having much
fresher experience of that kind. But now, about this other matter. I’ll
put a case to you. Mind! I admit nothing.”
He waited for me to declare that I quite understood that he
expressly said that he admitted nothing.
“Now, Pip,” said Mr. Jaggers, “put this case. Put the case that a
woman, under such circumstances as you have mentioned, held her
child concealed, and was obliged to communicate the fact to her legal
adviser, on his representing to her that he must know, with an eye to
the latitude of his defence, how the fact stood about that child. Put
the case that at the same time he held a trust to find a child for an
eccentric rich lady to adopt and bring up.”
“I follow you, sir.”
“Put the case that he lived in an atmosphere of evil, and that all he
saw of children, was, their being generated in great numbers for
certain destruction. Put the case that he often saw children solemnly
tried at a criminal bar, where they were held up to be seen; put the
case that he habitually knew of their being imprisoned, whipped,
transported, neglected, cast out, qualified in all ways for the hangman, and growing up to be hanged. Put the case that pretty nigh all
the children he saw in his daily business life, he had reason to look
upon as so much spawn, to develop into the fish that were to come
to his net––to be prosecuted, defended, forsworn, made orphans,
be-devilled somehow.”
“I follow you, sir.”
“Put the case, Pip, that here was one pretty little child out of the
li] Volume III Chapter XII 377
heap, who could be saved; whom the father believed dead, and dared
make no stir about; as to whom, over the mother, the legal adviser
had this power: ‘I know what you did, and how you did it. You came
so and so, this was your manner of attack and this the manner of
resistance, you went so and so, you did such and such things to divert
suspicion. I have tracked you through it all, and I tell it you all. Part
with the child, unless it should be necessary to produce it to clear
you, and then it shall be produced. Give the child into my hands, and
I will do my best to bring you off. If you are saved, your child is saved
too; if you are lost, your child is still saved.’ Put the case that this was
done, and that the woman was cleared.”
“I understand you perfectly.”
“But that I make no admissions?”
“That you make no admissions.” And Wemmick repeated, “No
admissions.”
“Put the case, Pip, that passion and the terror of death had a little
shaken the woman’s intellects, and that when she was set at liberty,
she was scared out of the ways of the world and went to him to be
sheltered. Put the case that he took her in, and that he kept down the
old wild violent nature whenever he saw an inkling of its breaking
out, by asserting his power over her in the old way. Do you comprehend the imaginary case?”
“Quite.”
“Put the case that the child grew up, and was married for money.
That the mother was still living. That the father was still living. That
the mother and father unknown to one another, were dwelling within
so many miles, furlongs, yards if you like, of one another. That the
secret was still a secret, except that you had got wind of it. Put that
last case to yourself very carefully.”
“I do.”
“I ask Wemmick to put it to himself very carefully.”
And Wemmick said, “I do.”
“For whose sake would you reveal the secret? For the father’s? I
think he would not be much the better for the mother. For the
mother’s? I think if she had done such a deed she would be safer
where she was. For the daughter’s? I think it would hardly serve her,
to establish her parentage for the information of her husband, and to
drag her back to disgrace, after an escape of twenty years, pretty
secure to last for life. But, add the case that you had loved her, Pip,
378 Great Expectations
and had made her the subject of those ‘poor dreams’ which have, at
one time or another, been in the heads of more men than you think
likely, then I tell you that you had better––and would much sooner
when you had thought well of it––chop off that bandaged left hand
of yours with your bandaged right hand, and then pass the chopper
on to Wemmick there, to cut that off, too.”
I looked at Wemmick, whose face was very grave. He gravely
touched his lips with his forefinger. I did the same. Mr. Jaggers did
the same. “Now, Wemmick,” said the latter then, resuming his usual
manner, “what item was it you were at, when Mr. Pip came in?”
Standing by for a little, while they were at work, I observed that
the odd looks they had cast at one another were repeated several
times: with this difference now, that each of them seemed suspicious,
not to say conscious, of having shown himself in a weak and
unprofessional light to the other. For this reason, I suppose, they
were now inflexible with one another; Mr. Jaggers being highly dictatorial, and Wemmick obstinately justifying himself whenever there
was the smallest point in abeyance for a moment. I had never seen
them on such ill terms; for generally they got on very well indeed
together.
But, they were both happily relieved by the opportune appearance
of Mike, the client with the fur cap and the habit of wiping his nose
on his sleeve, whom I had seen on the very first day of my appearance within those walls. This individual, who, either in his own
person or in that of some member of his family, seemed to be always
in trouble (which in that place meant Newgate), called to announce
that his eldest daughter was taken up on suspicion of shoplifting. As
he imparted this melancholy circumstance to Wemmick, Mr. Jaggers
standing magisterially before the fire and taking no share in the
proceedings, Mike’s eye happened to twinkle with a tear.
“What are you about?” demanded Wemmick, with the utmost
indignation. “What do you come snivelling here for?”
“I did’t* go to do it, Mr. Wemmick.”
“You did,” said Wemmick. “How dare you? You’re not in a fit
state to come here, if you can’t come here without spluttering like a
bad pen. What do you mean by it?”
“A man can’t help his feelings, Mr. Wemmick,” pleaded Mike.
“His what?” demanded Wemmick, quite savagely. “Say that
again!”
li] Volume III Chapter XII 379
“Now, look here my man,” said Mr. Jaggers, advancing a step, and
pointing to the door. “Get out of this office. I’ll have no feelings here.
Get out.”
“It serves you right,” said Wemmick. “Get out.”
So the unfortunate Mike very humbly withdrew, and Mr. Jaggers
and Wemmick appeared to have re-established their good understanding, and went to work again with an air of refreshment upon
them as if they had just had lunch.
CHAPTER XIII
From Little Britain, I went, with my cheque in my pocket, to
Miss Skiffins’s brother, the accountant; and Miss Skiffins’s brother,
the accountant, going straight to Clarriker’s and bringing Clarriker
to me, I had the great satisfaction of concluding that arrangement. It
was the only good thing I had done, and the only completed thing I
had done, since I was first apprised of my great expectations.
Clarriker informing me on that occasion that the affairs of the
House were steadily progressing, that he would now be able to establish a small branch-house in the East which was much wanted for the
extension of the business, and that Herbert in his new partnership
capacity would go out and take charge of it, I found that I must have
prepared for a separation from my friend, even though my own
affairs had been more settled. And now indeed I felt as if my last
anchor were loosening its hold, and I should soon be driving with the
winds and waves.
But, there was recompense in the joy with which Herbert would
come home of a night and tell me of these changes, little imagining
that he told me no news, and would sketch airy pictures of himself
conducting Clara Barley to the land of the Arabian Nights, and of
me going out to join them (with a caravan of camels, I believe), and
of our all going up the Nile and seeing wonders. Without being
sanguine as to my own part in these bright plans, I felt that Herbert’s
way was clearing fast, and that old Bill Barley had but to stick to his
pepper and rum, and his daughter would soon be happily provided
for.
We had now got into the month of March. My left arm, though it
presented no bad symptoms, took in the natural course so long to
380 Great Expectations
heal that I was still unable to get a coat on. My right arm was
tolerably restored;––disfigured, but fairly serviceable.
On a Monday morning, when Herbert and I were at breakfast, I
received the following letter from Wemmick by the post.
“Walworth. Burn this as soon as read. Early in the week, or say Wednesday, you might do what you know of, if you felt disposed to try it. Now
burn.”
When I had shown this to Herbert and had put it on the fire––but
not before we had both got it by heart––we considered what to do.
For, of course my being disabled could now be no longer kept out of
view.
“I have thought it over, again and again,” said Herbert, “and I
think I know a better course than taking a Thames waterman. Take
Startop. A good fellow, a skilled hand, fond of us, and enthusiastic
and honourable.”
I had thought of him, more than once.
“But how much would you tell him, Herbert?”
“It is necessary to tell him very little. Let him suppose it a mere
freak, but a secret one, until the morning comes: then let him know
that there is urgent reason for your getting Provis aboard and away.
You go with him?”
“No doubt.”
“Where?”
It seemed to me, in the many anxious considerations I had given
the point, almost indifferent what port we made for––Hamburg,
Rotterdam, Antwerp––the place signified little, so that he was got
out of England. Any foreign steamer that fell in our way and would
take us up, would do. I had always proposed to myself to get him well
down the river in the boat: certainly well beyond Gravesend,* which
was a critical place for search or inquiry if suspicion were afoot. As
foreign steamers would leave London at about the same time of
high-water, our plan would be to get down the river by a previous
ebb-tide, and lie by in some quiet spot until we could pull off to one.
The time when one would be due where we lay, wherever that might
be, could be calculated pretty nearly, if we made inquiries
beforehand.
Herbert assented to all this, and we went out immediately after
breakfast to pursue our investigations. We found that a steamer for
lii] Volume III Chapter XIII 381
Hamburg was likely to suit our purpose best, and we directed our
thoughts chiefly to that vessel. But we noted down what other foreign steamers would leave London with the same tide, and we satisfied ourselves that we knew the build and colour of each. We then
separated for a few hours; I, to get at once such passports as were
necessary; Herbert, to see Startop at his lodgings. We both did what
we had to do without any hindrance, and when we met again at one
o’clock reported it done. I, for my part, was prepared with passports;
Herbert had seen Startop, and he was more than ready to join.
Those two should pull a pair of oars, we settled, and I would steer;
our charge would be sitter, and keep quiet; as speed was not our
object, we should make way enough. We arranged that Herbert
should not come home to dinner before going to Mill Pond Bank that
evening; that he should not go there at all, to-morrow evening,
Tuesday; that he should prepare Provis to come down to some Stairs
hard by the house, on Wednesday, when he saw us approach, and not
sooner; that all the arrangements with him should be concluded that
Monday night; and that he should be communicated with no more in
any way, until we took him on board.
These precautions well understood by both of us, I went home.
On opening the door of our chambers with my key, I found a letter
in the box, directed to me; a very dirty letter, though not ill-written.
It had been delivered by hand (of course since I left home), and its
contents were these:
“If you are not afraid to come to the old marshes to-night or to-morrow
night at Nine, and to come to the little sluice-house by the limekiln, you
had better come. If you want information regarding your uncle Provis, you
had much better come and tell no one and lose no time. You must come
alone. Bring this with you.”
I had had load enough upon my mind before the receipt of this
strange letter. What to do now, I could not tell. And the worst was,
that I must decide quickly, or I should miss the afternoon coach,
which would take me down in time for to-night. To-morrow night I
could not think of going, for it would be too close upon the time of
the flight. And again, for anything I knew, the proffered information
might have some important bearing on the flight itself.
If I had had ample time for consideration, I believe I should still
have gone. Having hardly any time for consideration––my watch
382 Great Expectations
showing me that the coach started within half an hour––I resolved to
go. I should certainly not have gone, but for the reference to my
Uncle Provis; that, coming on Wemmick’s letter and the morning’s
busy preparation, turned the scale.
It is so difficult to become clearly possessed of the contents of
almost any letter, in a violent hurry, that I had to read this mysterious
epistle again, twice, before its injunction to me to be secret got
mechanically into my mind. Yielding to it in the same mechanical
kind of way, I left a note in pencil for Herbert, telling him that as I
should be so soon going away, I knew not for how long, I had decided
to hurry down and back, to ascertain for myself how Miss Havisham
was faring. I had then barely time to get my great-coat, lock up the
chambers, and make for the coach-office by the short by-ways. If I
had taken a hackney-chariot and gone by the streets, I should have
missed my aim; going as I did, I caught the coach just as it came out
of the yard. I was the only inside passenger, jolting away knee-deep
in straw, when I came to myself.
For, I really had not been myself since the receipt of the letter; it
had so bewildered me ensuing on the hurry of the morning. The
morning hurry and flutter had been great, for, long and anxiously as
I had waited for Wemmick, his hint had come like a surprise at last.
And now, I began to wonder at myself for being in the coach, and to
doubt whether I had sufficient reason for being there, and to consider whether I should get out presently and go back, and to argue
against ever heeding an anonymous communication, and, in short, to
pass through all those phases of contradiction and indecision to
which I suppose very few hurried people are strangers. Still, the
reference to Provis by name, mastered everything. I reasoned as I
had reasoned already without knowing it––if that be reasoning––in
case any harm should befal him through my not going, how could I
ever forgive myself !
It was dark before we got down, and the journey seemed long and
dreary to me who could see little of it inside, and who could not go
outside in my disabled state. Avoiding the Blue Boar, I put up at an
inn of minor reputation down the town, and ordered some dinner.
While it was preparing, I went to Satis House and inquired for Miss
Havisham; she was still very ill, though considered something better.
My inn had once been a part of an ancient ecclesiastical house,
and I dined in a little octagonal common-room, like a font. As I was
lii] Volume III Chapter XIII 383
not able to cut my dinner, the old landlord with a shining bald head
did it for me. This bringing us into conversation, he was so good as
to entertain me with my own story––of course with the popular
feature that Pumblechook was my earliest benefactor and the
founder of my fortunes.
“Do you know the young man?” said I.
“Know him!” repeated the landlord. “Ever since he was––no
height at all.”
“Does he ever come back to this neighbourhood?”
“Ay, he comes back,” said the landlord, “to his great friends, now
and again, and gives the cold shoulder to the man that made him.”
“What man is that?”
“Him that I speak of,” said the landlord. “Mr. Pumblechook.”
“Is he ungrateful to no one else?”
“No doubt he would be, if he could,” returned the landlord, “but
he can’t. And why? Because Pumblechook done everything for him.”
“Does Pumblechook say so?”
“Say so!” replied the landlord. “He han’t no call to say so.”
“But does he say so?”
“It would turn a man’s blood to white wine winegar to hear him
tell of it, sir,” said the landlord.
I thought, “Yet Joe, dear Joe, you never tell of it. Long-suffering
and loving, Joe, you never complain. Nor you, sweet-tempered
Biddy!”
“Your appetite’s been touched like, by your accident,” said the
landlord, glancing at the bandaged arm under my coat. “Try a tenderer bit.”
“No thank you,” I replied, turning from the table to brood over
the fire. “I can eat no more. Please take it away.”
I had never been struck at so keenly, for my thanklessness to Joe,
as through the brazen impostor Pumblechook. The falser he, the
truer Joe; the meaner he, the nobler Joe.
My heart was deeply and most deservedly humbled as I mused
over the fire for an hour or more. The striking of the clock aroused
me, but not from my dejection or remorse, and I got up and had my
coat fastened round my neck, and went out. I had previously sought
in my pockets for the letter, that I might refer to it again, but I could
not find it, and was uneasy to think that it must have been dropped in
the straw of the coach. I knew very well, however, that the appointed
384 Great Expectations
place was the little sluice-house by the limekiln on the marshes, and
the hour nine. Towards the marshes I now went straight, having no
time to spare.
CHAPTER XIV
It was a dark night, though the full moon rose as I left the enclosed
lands, and passed out upon the marshes. Beyond their dark line there
was a ribbon of clear sky, hardly broad enough to hold the red large
moon. In a few minutes she had ascended out of that clear field, in
among the piled mountains of cloud.
There was a melancholy wind, and the marshes were very dismal.
A stranger would have found them insupportable, and even to me
they were so oppressive that I hesitated, half inclined to go back.
But, I knew them well, and could have found my way on a far darker
night, and had no excuse for returning, being there. So, having come
there against my inclination, I went on against it.
The direction that I took, was not that in which my old home lay,
nor that in which we had pursued the convicts. My back was turned
towards the distant Hulks as I walked on, and, though I could see the
old lights away on the spits of sand, I saw them over my shoulder. I
knew the limekiln as well as I knew the old Battery, but they were
miles apart; so that if a light had been burning at each point that
night, there would have been a long strip of blank horizon between
the two bright specks.
At first, I had to shut some gates after me, and now and then to
stand still while the cattle that were lying in the banked-up pathway,
arose and blundered down among the grass and reeds. But after a
little while, I seemed to have the whole flats to myself.
It was another half-hour before I drew near to the kiln. The lime
was burning with a sluggish stifling smell, but the fires were made up
and left, and no workmen were visible. Hard by, was a small stonequarry. It lay directly in my way, and had been worked that day, as I
saw by the tools and barrows that were lying about.
Coming up again to the marsh level out of this excavation––for
the rude path lay through it––I saw a light in the old sluice-house. I
quickened my pace, and knocked at the door with my hand. Waiting
for some reply, I looked about me, noticing how the sluice was
liii] Volume III Chapter XIV 385
abandoned and broken, and how the house––of wood with a tiled
roof––would not be proof against the weather much longer, if it were
so even now, and how the mud and ooze were coated with lime, and
how the choking vapour of the kiln crept in a ghostly way towards
me. Still there was no answer, and I knocked again. No answer still,
and I tried the latch.
It rose under my hand, and the door yielded. Looking in, I saw a
lighted candle on a table, a bench, and a mattress on a truckle bedstead. As there was a loft above, I called, “Is there any one here?” but
no voice answered. Then, I looked at my watch, and, finding that it
was past nine, called again, “Is there any one here?” There being still
no answer, I went out at the door, irresolute what to do.
It was beginning to rain fast. Seeing nothing save what I had seen
already, I turned back into the house, and stood just within the
shelter of the doorway, looking out into the night. While I was considering that some one must have been there lately and must soon be
coming back, or the candle would not be burning, it came into my
head to look if the wick were long. I turned round to do so, and had
taken up the candle in my hand, when it was extinguished by some
violent shock, and the next thing I comprehended, was, that I had
been caught in a strong running noose, thrown over my head from
behind.
“Now,” said a suppressed voice with an oath, “I’ve got you!”
“What is this?” I cried, struggling. “Who is it? Help, help, help!”
Not only were my arms pulled close to my sides, but the pressure
on my bad arm caused me exquisite pain. Sometimes, a strong man’s
hand, sometimes a strong man’s breast, was set against my mouth to
deaden my cries, and with a hot breath always close to me, I struggled ineffectually in the dark, while I was fastened tight to the wall.
“And now,” said the suppressed voice with another oath, “call out
again, and I’ll make short work of you!”
Faint and sick with the pain of my injured arm, bewildered by the
surprise, and yet conscious how easily his threat could be put in
execution, I desisted, and tried to ease my arm were it ever so little.
But, it was bound too tight for that. I felt as if, having been burnt
before, it were now being boiled.
The sudden exclusion of the night and the substitution of black
darkness in its place, warned me that the man had closed a shutter.
After groping about for a little, he found the flint and steel he
386 Great Expectations
wanted, and began to strike a light. I strained my sight upon the
sparks that fell among the tinder, and upon which he breathed and
breathed, match in hand, but I could only see his lips, and the blue
point of the match; even those, but fitfully. The tinder was damp––
no wonder there––and one after another the sparks died out.
The man was in no hurry, and struck again with the flint and steel.
As the sparks fell thick and bright about him, I could see his hands,
and touches of his face, and could make out that he was seated and
bending over the table; but nothing more. Presently I saw his blue
lips again, breathing on the tinder, and then a flare of light flashed
up, and showed me Orlick.
Whom I had looked for, I don’t know. I had not looked for him.
Seeing him, I felt that I was in a dangerous strait indeed, and I kept
my eyes upon him.
He lighted the candle from the flaring match with great deliberation, and dropped the match, and trod it out. Then, he put the
candle away from him on the table, so that he could see me, and sat
with his arms folded on the table and looked at me. I made out that I
was fastened to a stout perpendicular ladder a few inches from the
wall––a fixture there––the means of ascent to the loft above.
“Now,” said he, when we had surveyed one another for some time,
“I’ve got you.”
“Unbind me. Let me go!”
“Ah!” he returned, “I ’ll let you go. I’ll let you go to the moon, I’ll
let you go to the stars. All in good time.”
“Why have you lured me here?”
“Don’t you know?” said he, with a deadly look.
“Why have you set upon me in the dark?”
“Because I mean to do it all myself. One keeps a secret better than
two. Oh you enemy, you enemy!”
His enjoyment of the spectacle I furnished, as he sat with his arms
folded on the table, shaking his head at me and hugging himself, had
a malignity in it that made me tremble. As I watched him in silence,
he put his hand into the corner at his side, and took up a gun with a
brass-bound stock.
“Do you know this?” said he, making as if he would aim at me.
“Do you know where you saw it afore? Speak, wolf !”
“Yes,” I answered.
“You cost me that place. You did. Speak!”
liii] Volume III Chapter XIV 387
“What else could I do?”
“You did that, and that would be enough, without more. How
dared you come betwixt me and a young woman I liked?”
“When did I?”
“When didn’t you? It was you as always give Old Orlick a bad
name to her.”
“You gave it to yourself; you gained it for yourself. I could have
done you no harm, if you had done yourself none.”
“You’re a liar. And you’ll take any pains, and spend any money, to
drive me out of this country, will you?” said he, repeating my words
to Biddy in the last interview I had with her. “Now, I’ll tell you a
piece of information. It was never so well worth your while to get me
out of this country as it is to-night. Ah! If it was all your money
twenty times told, to the last brass farden!” As he shook his heavy
hand at me, with his mouth snarling like a tiger’s, I felt that it was
true.
“What are you going to do to me?”
“I’m a going,” said he, bringing his fist down upon the table with a
heavy blow, and rising as the blow fell, to give it greater force, “I’m a
going to have your life!”
He leaned forward staring at me, slowly unclenched his hand and
drew it across his mouth as if his mouth watered for me, and sat
down again.
“You was always in Old Orlick’s way since ever you was a child.
You goes out of his way, this present night. He’ll have no more on
you. You’re dead.”
I felt that I had come to the brink of my grave. For a moment I
looked wildly round my trap for any chance of escape; but there was
none.
“More than that,” said he, folding his arms on the table again, “I
won’t have a rag of you, I won’t have a bone of you, left on earth. I’ll
put your body in the kiln––I’d carry two such to it, on my
shoulders––and, let people suppose what they may of you, they shall
never know nothing.”
My mind, with inconceivable rapidity, followed out all the consequences of such a death. Estella’s father would believe I had deserted him, would be taken, would die accusing me; even Herbert
would doubt me, when he compared the letter I had left for him,
with the fact that I had called at Miss Havisham’s gate for only a
388 Great Expectations
moment; Joe and Biddy would never know how sorry I had been that
night; none would ever know what I had suffered, how true I had
meant to be, what an agony I had passed through. The death close
before me was terrible, but far more terrible than death was the
dread of being misremembered after death. And so quick were my
thoughts, that I saw myself despised by unborn generations––
Estella’s children, and their children––while the wretch’s words
were yet on his lips.
“Now, wolf,” said he, “afore I kill you like any other beast––which
is wot I mean to do and wot I have tied you up for––I’ll have a good
look at you and a good goad at you. Oh, you enemy!”
It had passed through my thoughts to cry out for help again;
though few could know better than I, the solitary nature of the spot,
and the hopelessness of aid. But as he sat gloating over me, I was
supported by a scornful detestation of him that sealed my lips.
Above all things, I resolved that I would not entreat him, and that I
would die making some last poor resistance to him. Softened as my
thoughts of all the rest of men were in that dire extremity; humbly
beseeching pardon, as I did, of Heaven; melted at heart, as I was, by
the thought that I had taken no farewell, and never never now could
take farewell, of those who were dear to me, or could explain myself
to them, or ask for their compassion on my miserable errors; still, if I
could have killed him, even in dying, I would have done it.
He had been drinking, and his eyes were red and bloodshot.
Around his neck was slung a tin bottle, as I had often seen his meat
and drink slung about him in other days. He brought the bottle to his
lips, and took a fiery drink from it; and I smelt the strong spirits that
I saw flash into his face.
“Wolf !” said he, folding his arms again, “Old Orlick’s a going to
tell you somethink. It was you as did for your shrew sister.”
Again my mind, with its former inconceivable rapidity, had
exhausted the whole subject of the attack upon my sister, her illness,
and her death, before his slow and hesitating speech had formed
those words.
“It was you, villain,” said I.
“I tell you it was your doing––I tell you it was done through you,”
he retorted, catching up the gun, and making a blow with the stock at
the vacant air between us. “I come upon her from behind, as I come
upon you to-night. I giv’ it her! I left her for dead, and if there had
liii] Volume III Chapter XIV 389
been a lime kiln as nigh her as there is nigh you, she shouldn’t have
come to life again. But it warn’t Old Orlick as did it; it was you. You
was favoured, and he was bullied and beat. Old Orlick bullied and
beat, eh? Now you pays for it. You done it; now you pays for it.”
He drank again, and became more ferocious. I saw by his tilting of
the bottle that there was no great quantity left in it. I distinctly
understood that he was working himself up with its contents, to
make an end of me. I knew that every drop it held was a drop of my
life. I knew that when I was changed into a part of the vapour that
had crept towards me but a little while before, like my own warning
ghost, he would do as he had done in my sister’s case––make all haste
to the town, and be seen slouching about there, drinking at the alehouses. My rapid mind pursued him to the town, made a picture of
the street with him in it, and contrasted its lights and life with the
lonely marsh and the white vapour creeping over it, into which I
should have dissolved.
It was not only that I could have summed up years and years and
years while he said a dozen words, but that what he did say presented
pictures to me, and not mere words. In the excited and exalted state
of my brain, I could not think of a place without seeing it, or of
persons without seeing them. It is impossible to over-state the vividness of these images, and yet I was so intent, all the time, upon him
himself––who would not be intent on the tiger crouching to
spring!––that I knew of the slightest action of his fingers.
When he had drunk this second time, he rose from the bench on
which he sat, and pushed the table aside. Then, he took up the
candle, and shading it with his murderous hand so as to throw its
light on me, stood before me, looking at me and enjoying the sight.
“Wolf, I’ll tell you something more. It was Old Orlick as you
tumbled over on your stairs that night.”
I saw the staircase with its extinguished lamps. I saw the shadows
of the heavy stair-rails, thrown by the watchman’s lantern on the
wall. I saw the rooms that I was never to see again; here, a door half
open; there, a door closed; all the articles of furniture around.
“And why was Old Orlick there? I’ll tell you something more,
wolf. You and her have pretty well hunted me out of this country, so
far as getting a easy living in it goes, and I’ve took up with new
companions, and new masters. Some of ’em writes my letters when I
wants ’em wrote––do you mind?––writes my letters, wolf ! They
390 Great Expectations
writes fifty hands; they’re not like sneaking you, as writes but one.
I’ve had a firm mind and a firm will to have your life, since you was
down here at your sister’s burying. I han’t seen a way to get you safe,
and I’ve looked arter you to know your ins and outs. For, says Old
Orlick to himself, ‘Somehow or another I’ll have him!’ What! When I
looks for you, I finds your uncle Provis, eh?”
Mill Pond Bank, and Chinks’s Basin, and the Old Green Copper
Rope-Walk, all so clear and plain! Provis in his rooms, the signal
whose use was over, pretty Clara, the good motherly woman, old Bill
Barley on his back, all drifting by, as on the swift stream of my life
fast running out to sea!
“You with an uncle too! Why, I know’d you at Gargery’s when you
was so small a wolf that I could have took your weazen* betwixt this
finger and thumb and chucked you away dead (as I’d thoughts o’
doing, odd times, when I see you loitering amongst the pollards on a
Sunday), and you hadn’t found no uncles then. No, not you! But
when Old Orlick come for to hear that your uncle Provis had mostlike wore the leg-iron wot Old Orlick had picked up, filed asunder,
on these meshes ever so many year ago, and wot he kep by him till he
dropped your sister with it, like a bullock, as he means to drop you––
hey?––when he come for to hear that––hey?”––––
In his savage taunting, he flared the candle so close at me, that I
turned my face aside, to save it from the flame.
“Ah!” he cried, laughing, after doing it again, “the burnt child
dreads the fire!* Old Orlick knowed you was burnt, Old Orlick
knowed you was a smuggling your uncle Provis away, Old Orlick’s a
match for you and knowed you’d come to-night! Now I’ll tell you
something more, wolf, and this ends it. There’s them that’s as good a
match for your uncle Provis as Old Orlick has been for you. Let him
’ware them, when he’s lost his nevvy! Let him ’ware them when no
man can’t find a rag of his dear relation’s clothes, nor yet a bone of
his body? There’s them that can’t and that won’t have Magwitch––
yes, I know the name!––alive in the same land with them, and that’s
had such sure information of him when he was alive in another land,
as that he couldn’t and shouldn’t leave it unbeknown and put them
in danger. P’raps it’s them that writes fifty hands, and that’s not like
sneaking you as writes but one. ’Ware Compeyson, Magwitch, and
the gallows!”
He flared the candle at me again, smoking my face and hair, and
liii] Volume III Chapter XIV 391
for an instant blinding me, and turned his powerful back as he
replaced the light on the table. I had thought a prayer, and had been
with Joe and Biddy and Herbert, before he turned towards me again.
There was a clear space of a few feet between the table and the
opposite wall. Within this space, he now slouched backwards and
forwards. His great strength seemed to sit stronger upon him than
ever before, as he did this with his hands hanging loose and heavy at
his sides, and with his eyes scowling at me. I had no grain of hope
left. Wild as my inward hurry was, and wonderful the force of the
pictures that rushed by me instead of thoughts, I could yet clearly
understand that unless he had resolved that I was within a few
moments of surely perishing out of all human knowledge, he would
never have told me what he had told.
Of a sudden, he stopped, took the cork out of his bottle, and
tossed it away. Light as it was, I heard it fall like a plummet. He
swallowed slowly, tilting up the bottle by little and little, and now he
looked at me no more. The last few drops of liquor he poured into
the palm of his hand, and licked up. Then, with a sudden hurry of
violence and swearing horribly, he threw the bottle from him, and
stooped; and I saw in his hand a stone-hammer with a long heavy
handle.
The resolution I had made did not desert me, for, without uttering
one vain word of appeal to him, I shouted out with all my might, and
struggled with all my might. It was only my head and my legs that I
could move, but to that extent I struggled with all the force, until
then unknown, that was within me. In the same instant I heard
responsive shouts, saw figures and a gleam of light dash in at the
door, heard voices and tumult, and saw Orlick emerge from a struggle of men, as if it were tumbling water, clear the table at a leap, and
fly out into the night.
After a blank, I found that I was lying unbound, on the floor, in
the same place, with my head on some one’s knee. My eyes were
fixed on the ladder against the wall, when I came to myself––had
opened on it before my mind saw it––and thus as I recovered consciousness, I knew that I was in the place where I had lost it.
Too indifferent at first, even to look round and ascertain who
supported me, I was lying looking at the ladder, when there came
between me and it, a face. The face of Trabb’s boy!
392 Great Expectations
“I think he’s all right!” said Trabb’s boy, in a sober voice; “but
ain’t he just pale though!”
At these words, the face of him who supported me looked over
into mine, and I saw my supporter to be––––
“Herbert! Great Heaven!”
“Softly,” said Herbert. “Gently, Handel. Don’t be too eager.”
“And our old comrade, Startop!” I cried, as he too bent over me.
“Remember what he is going to assist us in,” said Herbert, “and
be calm.”
The allusion made me spring up; though I dropped again from
the pain in my arm. “The time has not gone by, Herbert, has it?
What night is to-night? How long have I been here?” For, I had a
strange and strong misgiving that I had been lying there a long
time––a day and a night––two days and nights––more.
“The time has not gone by. It is still Monday night.”
“Thank God!”
“And you have all to-morrow, Tuesday, to rest in,” said Herbert.
“But you can’t help groaning, my dear Handel. What hurt have you
got? Can you stand?”
“Yes, yes,” said I, “I can walk. I have no hurt but in this throbbing
arm.”
They laid it bare, and did what they could. It was violently swollen
and inflamed, and I could scarcely endure to have it touched. But,
they tore up their handkerchiefs to make fresh bandages, and carefully replaced it in the sling, until we could get to the town and
obtain some cooling lotion to put upon it. In a little while we had
shut the door of the dark and empty sluice-house, and were passing
through the quarry on our way back. Trabb’s boy––Trabb’s overgrown young man now––went before us with a lantern, which was
the light I had seen come in at the door. But, the moon was a good
two hours higher than when I had last seen the sky, and the night
though rainy was much lighter. The white vapour of the kiln was
passing from us as we went by, and, as I had thought a prayer before,
I thought a thanksgiving now.
Entreating Herbert to tell me how he had come to my rescue––
which at first he had flatly refused to do, but had insisted on my
remaining quiet––I learnt that I had in my hurry dropped the letter,
open, in our chambers, where he, coming home to bring with him
Startop whom he had met in the street on his way to me, found it,
liii] Volume III Chapter XIV 393
very soon after I was gone. Its tone made him uneasy, and the more
so because of the inconsistency between it and the hasty letter I had
left for him. His uneasiness increasing instead of subsiding after a
quarter of an hour’s consideration, he set off for the coach-office,
with Startop, who volunteered his company, to make inquiry when
the next coach went down. Finding that the afternoon coach was
gone, and finding that his uneasiness grew into positive alarm, as
obstacles came in his way, he resolved to follow in a post-chaise. So,
he and Startop arrived at the Blue Boar, fully expecting there to find
me, or tidings of me; but, finding neither, went to Miss Havisham’s,
where they lost me. Hereupon they went back to the hotel (doubtless
at about the time when I was hearing the popular local version of my
own story), to refresh themselves and to get some one to guide them
out upon the marshes. Among the loungers under the Boar’s archway, happened to be Trabb’s boy––true to his ancient habit of happening to be everywhere where he had no business––and Trabb’s
boy had seen me passing from Miss Havisham’s in the direction of
my dining-place. Thus, Trabb’s boy became their guide, and with
him they went out to the sluice-house: though by the town way to
the marshes, which I had avoided. Now, as they went along, Herbert
reflected, that I might, after all, have been brought there on some
genuine and serviceable errand tending to Provis’s safety, and,
bethinking himself that in that case interruption must be mischievous, left his guide and Startop on the edge of the quarry, and went on
by himself, and stole round the house two or three times, endeavouring to ascertain whether all was right within. As he could hear nothing but indistinct sounds of one deep rough voice (this was while my
mind was so busy), he even at last began to doubt whether I was
there, when suddenly I cried out loudly, and he answered the cries,
and rushed in, closely followed by the other two.
When I told Herbert what had passed within the house, he was for
our immediately going before a magistrate in the town, late at night
as it was, and getting out a warrant. But, I had already considered
that such a course, by detaining us there, or binding us to come back,
might be fatal to Provis. There was no gainsaying this difficulty, and
we relinquished all thoughts of pursuing Orlick at that time. For the
present, under the circumstances, we deemed it prudent to make
rather light of the matter to Trabb’s boy; who I am convinced would
have been much affected by disappointment, if he had known that
394 Great Expectations
his intervention saved me from the limekiln. Not that Trabb’s boy
was of a malignant nature, but that he had too much spare vivacity,
and that it was in his constitution to want variety and excitement at
anybody’s expense. When we parted, I presented him with two
guineas (which seemed to meet his views), and told him that I was
sorry ever to have had an ill opinion of him (which made no impression on him at all).
Wednesday being so close upon us, we determined to go back to
London that night, three in the post-chaise; the rather, as we should
then be clear away, before the night’s adventure began to be talked of.
Herbert got a large bottle of stuff for my arm, and by dint of having
this stuff dropped over it all the night through, I was just able to bear
its pain on the journey. It was daylight when we reached the Temple,
and I went at once to bed, and lay in bed all day.
My terror, as I lay there, of falling ill and being unfitted for tomorrow, was so besetting, that I wonder it did not disable me of
itself. It would have done so, pretty surely, in conjunction with the
mental wear and tear I had suffered, but for the unnatural strain
upon me that to-morrow was. So anxiously looked forward to,
charged with such consequences, its results so impenetrably hidden
though so near.
No precaution could have been more obvious than our refraining
from communication with him that day; yet this again increased my
restlessness. I started at every footstep and every sound, believing
that he was discovered and taken, and this was the messenger to tell
me so. I persuaded myself that I knew he was taken; that there was
something more upon my mind than a fear or a presentiment; that
the fact had occurred, and I had a mysterious knowledge of it. As the
day wore on and no ill news came, as the day closed in and darkness
fell, my overshadowing dread of being disabled by illness before tomorrow morning, altogether mastered me. My burning arm
throbbed, and my burning head throbbed, and I fancied I was beginning to wander. I counted up to high numbers, to make sure of
myself, and repeated passages that I knew in prose and verse. It
happened sometimes that in the mere escape of a fatigued mind, I
dozed for some moments or forgot; then I would say to myself with a
start, “Now it has come, and I am turning delirious!”
They kept me very quiet all day, and kept my arm constantly
dressed, and gave me cooling drinks. Whenever I fell asleep, I awoke
liii] Volume III Chapter XIV 395
with the notion I had had in the sluice-house, that a long time had
elapsed and the opportunity to save him was gone. About midnight I
got out of bed and went to Herbert, with the conviction that I had
been asleep for four-and-twenty hours, and that Wednesday was
past. It was the last self-exhausting effort of my fretfulness, for, after
that, I slept soundly.
Wednesday morning was dawning when I looked out of the
window. The winking lights upon the bridges were already pale, the
coming sun was like a marsh of fire on the horizon. The river, still
dark and mysterious, was spanned by bridges that were turning
coldly grey, with here and there at top a warm touch from the
burning in the sky. As I looked along the clustered roofs, with
Church towers and spires shooting into the unusually clear air, the
sun rose up, and a veil seemed to be drawn from the river, and
millions of sparkles burst out upon its waters. From me too, a veil
seemed to be drawn, and I felt strong and well.
Herbert lay asleep in his bed, and our old fellow-student lay asleep
on the sofa. I could not dress myself without help, but I made up the
fire, which was still burning, and got some coffee ready for them. In
good time they too started up strong and well, and we admitted the
sharp morning air at the windows, and looked at the tide that was
still flowing towards us.
“When it turns at nine o’clock,” said Herbert, cheerfully, “look
out for us, and stand ready, you over there at Mill Pond Bank!”
CHAPTER XV
It was one of those March days when the sun shines hot and the
wind blows cold: when it is summer in the light, and winter in the
shade. We had our pea-coats with us, and I took a bag. Of all my
worldly possessions I took no more than the few necessaries that
filled the bag. Where I might go, what I might do, or when I might
return, were questions utterly unknown to me; nor did I vex my
mind with them, for it was wholly set on Provis’s safety. I only
wondered for the passing moment, as I stopped at the door and
looked back, under what altered circumstances I should next see
those rooms, if ever.
We loitered down to the Temple stairs, and stood loitering there,
396 Great Expectations
as if we were not quite decided to go upon the water at all. Of course
I had taken care that the boat should be ready and everything in
order. After a little show of indecision, which there were none to see
but the two or three amphibious creatures belonging to our Temple
stairs, we went on board and cast off; Herbert in the bow, I steering.
It was then about high-water––half-past eight.
Our plan* was this. The tide, beginning to run down at nine, and
being with us until three, we intended still to creep on after it had
turned, and row against it until dark. We should then be well in
those long reaches below Gravesend, between Kent and Essex,
where the river is broad and solitary, where the water-side inhabitants are very few, and where lone public-houses are scattered here
and there, of which we could choose one for a resting-place. There,
we meant to lie by, all night. The steamer for Hamburg, and the
steamer for Rotterdam, would start from London at about nine on
Thursday morning. We should know at what time to expect them,
according to where we were, and would hail the first; so that if by any
accident we were not taken aboard, we should have another chance.
We knew the distinguishing marks of each vessel.
The relief of being at last engaged in the execution of the purpose,
was so great to me that I felt it difficult to realise the condition in
which I had been a few hours before. The crisp air, the sunlight, the
movement on the river, and the moving river itself––the road that
ran with us, seeming to sympathise with us, animate us, and encourage us on––freshened me with new hope. I felt mortified to be of so
little use in the boat; but, there were few better oarsmen than my two
friends, and they rowed with a steady stroke that was to last all day.
At that time, the steam-traffic on the Thames was far below its
present extent, and watermen’s boats were far more numerous. Of
barges, sailing colliers, and coasting-traders,* there were perhaps as
many as now; but, of steam-ships, great and small, not a tithe or a
twentieth part so many. Early as it was, there were plenty of scullers
going here and there that morning, and plenty of barges dropping
down with the tide; the navigation of the river between bridges, in
an open boat, was a much easier and commoner matter in those
days than it is in these; and we went ahead among many skiffs and
wherries,* briskly.
Old London Bridge was soon passed, and old Billingsgate market
with its oyster-boats and Dutchmen,* and the White Tower and
liv] Volume III Chapter XV 397
Traitors’ Gate, and we were in among the tiers of shipping. Here,
were the Leith, Aberdeen, and Glasgow steamers, loading and
unloading goods, and looking immensely high out of the water as we
passed alongside; here, were colliers by the score and score, with the
coal-whippers* plunging off stages on deck, as counterweights to
measures of coal swinging up, which were then rattled over the side
into barges; here, at her moorings was to-morrow’s steamer for Rotterdam, of which we took good notice; and here to-morrow’s for
Hamburg, under whose bowsprit we crossed. And now I, sitting in
the stern, could see with a faster beating heart, Mill Pond Bank and
Mill Pond stairs.
“Is he there?” said Herbert.
“Not yet.”
“Right! He was not to come down till he saw us. Can you see his
signal?”
“Not well from here; but I think I see it.––Now, I see him! Pull
both. Easy, Herbert. Oars!”
We touched the stairs lightly for a single moment, and he was on
board and we were off again. He had a boat-cloak with him, and a
black canvas bag, and he looked as like a river-pilot* as my heart
could have wished.
“Dear boy!” he said, putting his arm on my shoulder as he took
his seat. “Faithful dear boy, well done. Thankye, thankye!”
Again among the tiers of shipping, in and out, avoiding rusty
chain-cables, frayed hempen hawsers* and bobbing buoys, sinking
for the moment floating broken baskets, scattering floating chips of
wood and shaving, cleaving floating scum of coal, in and out, under
the figure-head of the John of Sunderland making a speech to the
winds (as is done by many Johns),* and the Betsy of Yarmouth with a
firm formality of bosom and her knobby eyes starting two inches out
of her head, in and out, hammers going in ship-builders’ yards, saws
going at timber, clashing engines going at things unknown, pumps
going in leaky ships, capstans going, ships going out to sea, and
unintelligible sea-creatures roaring curses over the bulwarks at
respondent lightermen,* in and out––out at last upon the clearer
river, where the ships’ boys might take their fenders in, no longer
fishing in troubled waters with them over the side, and where the
festooned sails might fly out to the wind.
At the Stairs where we had taken him aboard, and ever since, I had
398 Great Expectations
looked warily for any token of our being suspected. I had seen none.
We certainly had not been, and at the time as certainly we were not,
either attended or followed by any boat. If we had been waited on by
any boat, I should have run in to shore, and have obliged her to go
on, or to make her purpose evident. But, we held our own, without
any appearance of molestation.
He had his boat-cloak on him, and looked, as I have said, a natural
part of the scene. It was remarkable (but perhaps the wretched life he
had led, accounted for it), that he was the least anxious of any of us.
He was not indifferent, for he told me that he hoped to live to see his
gentleman one of the best of gentlemen in a foreign country; he was
not disposed to be passive or resigned, as I understood it; but he had
no notion of meeting danger half way. When it came upon him, he
confronted it, but it must come before he troubled himself.
“If you knowed, dear boy,” he said to me, “what it is to sit here
alonger my dear boy and have my smoke, arter having been day by
day betwixt four walls, you’d envy me. But you don’t know what it
is.”
“I think I know the delights of freedom,” I answered.
“Ah,” said he, shaking his head gravely. “But you don’t know it
equal to me. You must have been under lock and key, dear boy, to
know it equal to me––but I ain’t a going to be low.”
It occurred to me as inconsistent, that for any mastering idea, he
should have endangered his freedom and even his life. But I reflected
that perhaps freedom without danger was too much apart from all
the habit of his existence to be to him what it would be to another
man. I was not far out, since he said, after smoking a little:
“You see, dear boy, when I was over yonder, t’other side the world,
I was always a looking to this side; and it come flat to be there, for all
I was a growing rich. Everybody knowed Magwitch, and Magwitch
could come, and Magwitch could go, and nobody’s head would be
troubled about him. They ain’t so easy concerning me here, dear
boy––wouldn’t be, leastwise, if they knowed where I was.”
“If all goes well,” said I, “you will be perfectly free and safe again,
within a few hours.”
“Well,” he returned, drawing a long breath, “I hope so.”
“And think so?”
He dipped his hand in the water over the boat’s gunwale, and said,
smiling with that softened air upon him which was not new to me:
liv] Volume III Chapter XV 399
“Ay, I s’pose I think so, dear boy. We’d be puzzled to be more quiet
and easy-going than we are at present. But––it’s a flowing so soft and
pleasant through the water, p’raps, as makes me think it––I was a
thinking through my smoke just then, that we can no more see to the
bottom of the next few hours, than we can see to the bottom of this
river what I catches hold of. Nor yet we can’t no more hold their tide
than I can hold this. And it’s run through my fingers and gone, you
see!” holding up his dripping hand.
“But for your face, I should think you were a little despondent,”
said I.
“Not a bit on it, dear boy! It comes of flowing on so quiet, and of
that there rippling at the boat’s head making a sort of a Sunday tune.
Maybe I’m a growing a trifle old besides.”
He put his pipe back in his mouth with an undisturbed expression
of face, and sat as composed and contented as if we were already out
of England. Yet he was as submissive to a word of advice as if he had
been in constant terror, for, when we ran ashore to get some bottles
of beer into the boat, and he was stepping out, I hinted that I
thought he would be safest where he was, and he said, “Do you, dear
boy?” and quietly sat down again.
 The air felt cold upon the river, but it was a bright day, and the
sunshine was very cheering. The tide ran strong, I took care to lose
none of it, and our steady stroke carried us on thoroughly well. By
imperceptible degrees, as the tide ran out, we lost more and more of
the nearer woods and hills, and dropped lower and lower between the
muddy banks, but the tide was yet with us when we were off Gravesend. As our charge was wrapped in his cloak, I purposely passed
within a boat or two’s length of the floating Custom House, and so
out to catch the stream, alongside of two emigrant ships, and under
the bows of a large transport with troops on the forecastle looking
down at us. And soon the tide began to slacken, and the craft lying at
anchor to swing, and presently they had all swung round, and the
ships that were taking advantage of the new tide to get up to the
Pool, began to crowd upon us in a fleet, and we kept under the shore,
as much out of the strength of the tide now as we could, standing
carefully off from low shallows and mud-banks.
Our oarsmen were so fresh, by dint of having occasionally let her
drive with the tide for a minute or two, that a quarter of an hour’s
rest proved full as much as they wanted. We got ashore among some
400 Great Expectations
slippery stones while we ate and drank what we had with us, and
looked about. It was like my own marsh country, flat and monotonous, and with a dim horizon; while the winding river turned and
turned, and the great floating buoys upon it turned and turned, and
everything else seemed stranded and still. For, now, the last of the
fleet of ships was round the last low point we had headed; and the
last green barge, straw-laden, with a brown sail, had followed; and
some ballast-lighters,* shaped like a child’s first rude imitation of a
boat, lay low in the mud; and a little squat shoal-lighthouse on open
piles, stood crippled in the mud on stilts and crutches; and slimy
stakes stuck out of the mud, and slimy stones stuck out of the mud,
and red landmarks and tidemarks stuck out of the mud, and an old
landing-stage and an old roofless building slipped into the mud, and
all about us was stagnation and mud.
We pushed off again, and made what way we could. It was much
harder work now, but Herbert and Startop persevered, and rowed,
and rowed, and rowed, until the sun went down. By that time the
river had lifted us a little, so that we could see above the bank. There
was the red sun, on the low level of the shore, in a purple haze, fast
deepening into black; and there was the solitary flat marsh; and far
away there were the rising grounds, between which and us there
seemed to be no life, save here and there in the foreground a melancholy gull.
As the night was fast falling, and as the moon, being past the full,
would not rise early, we held a little council: a short one, for clearly
our course was to lie by at the first lonely tavern we could find. So,
they plied their oars once more, and I looked out for anything like a
house. Thus we held on, speaking little, for four or five dull miles. It
was very cold, and, a collier coming by us, with her galley-fire smoking and flaring, looked like a comfortable home. The night was as
dark by this time as it would be until morning; and what light we
had, seemed to come more from the river than the sky, as the oars in
their dipping struck at a few reflected stars.
At this dismal time we were evidently all possessed by the idea
that we were being followed. As the tide made, it flapped heavily at
irregular intervals against the shore; and whenever such a sound
came, one or other of us was sure to start and look in that direction.
Here and there, the set of the current had worn down the bank into a
little creek, and we were all suspicious of such places, and eyed them
liv] Volume III Chapter XV 401
nervously. Sometimes, “What was that ripple!” one of us would say
in a low voice. Or another, “Is that a boat yonder?” And afterwards,
we would fall into a dead silence, and I would sit impatiently thinking with what an unusual amount of noise the oars worked in the
thowels.*
At length we descried a light and a roof, and presently afterwards
ran alongside a little causeway made of stones that had been picked
up hard-by. Leaving the rest in the boat, I stepped ashore, and found
the light to be in a window of a public-house. It was a dirty place
enough, and I dare say not unknown to smuggling adventurers; but
there was a good fire in the kitchen, and there were eggs and bacon to
eat, and various liquors to drink. Also, there were two doublebedded rooms––“such as they were,” the landlord said. No other
company was in the house than the landlord, his wife, and a grizzled
male creature, the “Jack”* of the little causeway, who was as slimy and
smeary as if he had been low-water mark too.
With this assistant, I went down to the boat again, and we all came
ashore, and brought out the oars, and rudder, and boat-hook, and all
else, and hauled her up for the night. We made a very good meal by
the kitchen fire, and then apportioned the bedrooms: Herbert and
Startop were to occupy one; I and our charge the other. We found
the air as carefully excluded from both, as if air were fatal to life; and
there were more dirty clothes and bandboxes* under the beds than I
should have thought the family possessed. But, we considered ourselves well off, notwithstanding, for a more solitary place we could
not have found.
While we were comforting ourselves by the fire after our meal, the
Jack––who was sitting in a corner, and who had a bloated pair of
shoes on, which he had exhibited while we were eating our eggs and
bacon, as interesting relics that he had taken a few days ago from the
feet of a drowned seaman washed ashore––asked me if we had seen a
four-oared galley going up with the tide? When I told him No, he
said she must have gone down then, and yet she “took up too,” when
she left there.
“They must ha’ thought better on’t for some reason or another,”
said the Jack, “and gone down.”
“A four-oared galley, did you say?” said I.
“A four,” said the Jack, “and two sitters.”
“Did they come ashore here?”
402 Great Expectations
“They put in with a stone two-gallon jar, for some beer. I’d ha’
been glad to pison the beer myself,” said the Jack, “or put some
rattling physic* in it.”
“Why?”
“I know why,” said the Jack. He spoke in a slushy voice, as if much
mud had washed into his throat.
“He thinks,” said the landlord: a weakly meditative man with a
pale eye, who seemed to rely greatly on his Jack: “he thinks they was,
what they wasn’t.”
“I knows what I thinks,” observed the Jack.
“You thinks Custum ’Us, Jack?” said the landlord.
“I do,” said the Jack.
“Then you’re wrong, Jack.”
“Am I!”
In the infinite meaning of his reply and his boundless confidence
in his views, the Jack took one of his bloated shoes off, looked into it,
knocked a few stones out of it on the kitchen floor, and put it on
again. He did this with the air of a Jack who was so right that he
could afford to do anything.
“Why, what do you make out that they done with their buttons
then, Jack?” asked the landlord, vacillating weakly.
“Done with their buttons?” returned the Jack. “Chucked ’em
overboard. Swallered ’em. Sowed ’em, to come up small salad.*
Done with their buttons!”
“Don’t be cheeky, Jack,” remonstrated the landlord, in a melancholy and pathetic way.
“A Custum ’Us officer knows what to do with his Buttons,” said
the Jack, repeating the obnoxious word with the greatest contempt,
“when they comes betwixt him and his own light. A Four and two
sitters don’t go hanging and hovering, up with one tide and down
with another, and both with and against another, without there being
Custum ’Us at the bottom of it.” Saying which he went out in
disdain; and the landlord, having no one to rely upon, found it
impracticable to pursue the subject.
This dialogue made us all uneasy, and me very uneasy. The dismal
wind was muttering round the house, the tide was flapping at the
shore, and I had a feeling that we were caged and threatened. A fouroared galley hovering about in so unusual a way as to attract this
notice, was an ugly circumstance that I could not get rid of. When I
liv] Volume III Chapter XV 403
had induced Provis to go up to bed, I went outside with my two
companions (Startop by this time knew the state of the case), and
held another council. Whether we should remain at the house until
near the steamer’s time, which would be about one in the afternoon;
or whether we should put off early in the morning; was the question
we discussed. On the whole we deemed it the better course to lie
where we were, until within an hour or so of the steamer’s time, and
then to get out in her track, and drift easily with the tide. Having
settled to do this, we returned into the house and went to bed.
I lay down with the greater part of my clothes on, and slept well
for a few hours. When I awoke, the wind had risen, and the sign of
the house (the Ship) was creaking and banging about, with noises
that startled me. Rising softly, for my charge lay fast asleep, I looked
out of the window. It commanded the causeway where we had hauled
up our boat, and, as my eyes adapted themselves to the light of the
clouded moon, I saw two men looking into her. They passed by
under the window, looking at nothing else, and they did not go down
to the landing-place which I could discern to be empty, but struck
across the marsh in the direction of the Nore.*
My first impulse was to call up Herbert, and show him the two
men going away. But, reflecting before I got into his room, which was
at the back of the house and adjoined mine, that he and Startop had
had a harder day than I, and were fatigued, I forbore. Going back to
my window, I could see the two men moving over the marsh. In that
light, however, I soon lost them, and feeling very cold, lay down to
think of the matter, and fell asleep again.
We were up early. As we walked to and fro, all four together, before
breakfast, I deemed it right to recount what I had seen. Again our
charge was the least anxious of the party. It was very likely that the
men belonged to the Custom House, he said quietly, and that they
had no thought of us. I tried to persuade myself that it was so––as,
indeed, it might easily be. However, I proposed that he and I should
walk away together to a distant point we could see, and that the boat
should take us aboard there, or as near there as might prove feasible,
at about noon. This being considered a good precaution, soon after
breakfast he and I set forth, without saying anything at the tavern.
He smoked his pipe as we went along, and sometimes stopped to
clap me on the shoulder. One would have supposed that it was I who
was in danger, not he, and that he was reassuring me. We spoke very
404 Great Expectations
little. As we approached the point, I begged him to remain in a
sheltered place, while I went on to reconnoitre; for, it was towards it
that the men had passed in the night. He complied, and I went on
alone. There was no boat off the point, nor any boat drawn up
anywhere near it, nor were there any signs of the men having
embarked there. But, to be sure the tide was high, and there might
have been some footprints under water.
When he looked out from his shelter in the distance, and saw that
I waved my hat to him to come up, he rejoined me, and there we
waited: sometimes lying on the bank wrapped in our coats, and
sometimes moving about to warm ourselves: until we saw our boat
coming round. We got aboard easily, and rowed out into the track of
the steamer. By that time it wanted but ten minutes of one o’clock,
and we began to look out for her smoke.
But, it was half-past one before we saw her smoke, and soon
afterwards we saw behind it the smoke of another steamer. As they
were coming on at full speed, we got the two bags ready, and took
that opportunity of saying good-by to Herbert and Startop. We had
all shaken hands cordially, and neither Herbert’s eyes nor mine
were quite dry, when I saw a four-oared galley shoot out from
under the bank but a little way ahead of us, and row out into the
same track.
A stretch of shore had been as yet between us and the steamer’s
smoke, by reason of the bend and wind of the river; but now she was
visible, coming head on. I called to Herbert and Startop to keep
before the tide, that she might see us lying by for her, and I adjured
Provis to sit quite still, wrapped in his cloak. He answered cheerily,
“Trust to me, dear boy,” and sat like a statue. Meantime the galley,
which was very skilfully handled, had crossed us, let us come up with
her, and fallen alongside. Leaving just room enough for the play of
the oars, she kept alongside, drifting when we drifted, and pulling a
stroke or two when we pulled. Of the two sitters, one held the rudder
lines, and looked at us attentively––as did all the rowers; the other
sitter was wrapped up, much as Provis was, and seemed to shrink,
and whisper some instruction to the steerer as he looked at us. Not a
word was spoken in either boat.
Startop could make out, after a few minutes, which steamer was
first, and gave me the word “Hamburg,” in a low voice as we sat face
to face. She was nearing us very fast, and the beating of her paddles
liv] Volume III Chapter XV 405
grew louder and louder. I felt as if her shadow were absolutely upon
us, when the galley hailed us. I answered.
“You have a returned Transport there,” said the man who held the
lines. “That’s the man, wrapped in the cloak. His name is Abel
Magwitch, otherwise Provis. I apprehend that man, and call upon
him to surrender, and you to assist.”
At the same moment, without giving any audible direction to his
crew, he ran the galley aboard of us. They had pulled one sudden
stroke ahead, had got their oars in, had run athwart us, and were
holding on to our gunwale, before we knew what they were doing.
This caused great confusion on board the steamer, and I heard them
calling to us, and heard the order given to stop the paddles, and
heard them stop, but felt her driving down upon us irresistibly. In
the same moment, I saw the steersman of the galley lay his hand on
his prisoner’s shoulder, and saw that both boats were swinging round
with the force of the tide, and saw that all hands on board the
steamer were running forward quite frantically. Still in the same
moment, I saw the prisoner start up, lean across his captor, and pull
the cloak from the neck of the shrinking sitter in the galley. Still in
the same moment, I saw that the face disclosed, was the face of the
other convict of long ago. Still in the same moment, I saw the face tilt
backward with a white terror on it that I shall never forget, and heard
a great cry on board the steamer and a loud splash in the water, and
felt the boat sink from under me.
It was but for an instant that I seemed to struggle with a thousand
mill-weirs and a thousand flashes of light; that instant past, I was
taken on board the galley. Herbert was there, and Startop was there;
but our boat was gone, and the two convicts were gone.
What with the cries aboard the steamer, and the furious blowingoff of her steam, and her driving on, and our driving on, I could not
at first distinguish sky from water or shore from shore; but, the crew
of the galley righted her with great speed, and, pulling certain swift
strong strokes ahead, lay upon their oars, every man looking silently
and eagerly at the water astern. Presently a dark object was seen in it,
bearing towards us on the tide. No man spoke, but the steersman
held up his hand, and all softly backed water, and kept the boat
straight and true before it. As it came nearer, I saw it to be Magwitch, swimming, but not swimming freely. He was taken on board,
and instantly manacled at the wrists and ankles.
406 Great Expectations
The galley was kept steady, and the silent eager look-out at the
water was resumed. But, the Rotterdam steamer now came up, and
apparently not understanding what had happened, came on at speed.
By the time she had been hailed and stopped, both steamers were
drifting away from us, and we were rising and falling in a troubled
wake of water. The look-out was kept, long after all was still again
and the two steamers were gone; but, everybody knew that it was
hopeless now.
At length we gave it up, and pulled under the shore towards the
tavern we had lately left, where we were received with no little surprise. Here, I was able to get some comforts for Magwitch––Provis
no longer––who had received some very severe injury in the chest
and a deep cut in the head.
He told me that he believed himself to have gone under the keel of
the steamer, and to have been struck on the head in rising. The
injury to his chest (which rendered his breathing extremely painful)
he thought he had received against the side of the galley. He added
that he did not pretend to say what he might or might not have done
to Compeyson, but, that in the moment of his laying his hand on his
cloak to identify him, that villain had staggered up and staggered
back, and they had both gone overboard together; when the sudden
wrenching of him (Magwitch) out of our boat, and the endeavour of
his captor to keep him in it, had capsized us. He told me in a whisper
that they had gone down fiercely locked in each other’s arms, and
that there had been a struggle under the water, and that he had
disengaged himself, struck out, and swum away.
I never had any reason to doubt the exact truth of what he thus
told me. The officer who steered the galley gave the same account of
their going overboard.
When I asked this officer’s permission to change the prisoner’s
wet clothes by purchasing any spare garments I could get at the
public-house, he gave it readily: merely observing that he must take
charge of everything his prisoner had about him. So the pocket-book
which had once been in my hands, passed into the officer’s. He
further gave me leave to accompany the prisoner to London; but,
declined to accord that grace to my two friends.
The Jack at the Ship was instructed where the drowned man had
gone down, and undertook to search for the body in the places where
it was likeliest to come ashore. His interest in its recovery seemed to
liv] Volume III Chapter XV 407
me to be much heightened when he heard that it had stockings on.
Probably, it took about a dozen drowned men to fit him out completely; and that may have been the reason why the different articles
of his dress were in various stages of decay.
We remained at the public-house until the tide turned, and then
Magwitch was carried down to the galley and put on board. Herbert
and Startop were to get to London by land, as soon as they could. We
had a doleful parting, and when I took my place by Magwitch’s side,
I felt that that was my place henceforth while he lived.
For now, my repugnance to him had all melted away, and in the
hunted wounded shackled creature who held my hand in his, I only
saw a man who had meant to be my benefactor, and who had felt
affectionately, gratefully, and generously, towards me with great constancy through a series of years. I only saw in him a much better man
than I had been to Joe.
His breathing became more difficult and painful as the night drew
on, and often he could not repress a groan. I tried to rest him on the
arm I could use, in any easy position; but, it was dreadful to think
that I could not be sorry at heart for his being badly hurt, since it was
unquestionably best that he should die. That there were, still living,
people enough who were able and willing to identify him, I could not
doubt. That he would be leniently treated, I could not hope. He who
had been presented in the worst light at his trial, who had since
broken prison and been tried again, who had returned from transportation under a life sentence, and who had occasioned the death of
the man who was the cause of his arrest.
As we returned towards the setting sun we had yesterday left behind us, and as the stream of our hopes seemed all running back, I told
him how grieved I was to think that he had come home for my sake.
“Dear boy,” he answered, “I’m quite content to take my chance.
I’ve seen my boy, and he can be a gentleman without me.”
No. Apart from any inclinations of my own, I had thought about
that, while we had been there side by side. I understood Wemmick’s
hint now. I foresaw that, being convicted, his possessions would be
forfeited to the Crown.
“Lookee here, dear boy,” said he. “It’s best as a gentleman should
not be knowed to belong to me now. Only come to see me as if you
come by chance alonger Wemmick. Sit where I can see you when I
am swore to, for the last o’ many times, and I don’t ask no more.”
408 Great Expectations
“I will never stir from your side,” said I, “when I am suffered to be
near you. Please God, I will be as true to you, as you have been to
me!”
I felt his hand tremble as it held mine, and he turned his face away
as he lay in the bottom of the boat, and I heard that old sound in his
throat––softened now, like all the rest of him. It was a good thing
that he had touched this point, for it put into my mind what I might
not otherwise have thought of until too late: That he need never
know how his hopes of enriching me had perished.
CHAPTER XVI
He was taken to the Police Court next day, and would have been
immediately committed for trial, but that it was necessary to send
down for an old officer of the prison-ship from which he had once
escaped, to speak to his identity. Nobody doubted it; but Compeyson, who had meant to depose to it, was tumbling on the tides, dead,
and it happened that there was not at that time any prison officer in
London who could give the required evidence. I had gone direct to
Mr. Jaggers at his private house, on my arrival over-night, to retain
his assistance, and Mr. Jaggers on the prisoner’s behalf would admit
nothing. It was the sole resource, for he told me that the case must be
over in five minutes when the witness was there, and that no power
on earth could prevent its going against us.
I imparted to Mr. Jaggers my design of keeping him in ignorance
of the fate of his wealth. Mr. Jaggers was querulous and angry with
me for having “let it slip through my fingers,” and said we must
memorialise* by-and-by, and try at all events for some of it. But, he
did not conceal from me that although there might be many cases in
which the forfeiture would not be exacted, there were no circumstances in this case to make it one of them. I understood that, very
well. I was not related to the outlaw, or connected with him by any
recognisable tie; he had put his hand to no writing or settlement in
my favour before his apprehension, and to do so now would be idle. I
had no claim, and I finally resolved, and ever afterwards abided by
the resolution, that my heart should never be sickened with the
hopeless task of attempting to establish one.
There appeared to be reason for supposing that the drowned
lv] Volume III Chapter XVI 409
informer had hoped for a reward out of this forfeiture, and had
obtained some accurate knowledge of Magwitch’s affairs. When his
body was found, many miles from the scene of his death, and so
horribly disfigured that he was only recognisable by the contents of
his pockets, notes were still legible, folded in a case he carried.
Among these, were the name of a banking-house in New South
Wales where a sum of money was, and the designation of certain
lands of considerable value. Both these heads of information were in
a list that Magwitch, while in prison, gave to Mr. Jaggers, of the
possessions he supposed I should inherit. His ignorance, poor fellow,
at last served him; he never mistrusted but that my inheritance was
quite safe, with Mr. Jaggers’s aid.
After three days’ delay, during which the crown prosecution stood
over for the production of the witness from the prison-ship, the
witness came, and completed the easy case. He was committed to
take his trial at the next Sessions, which would come on in a month.
It was at this dark time of my life that Herbert returned home one
evening, a good deal cast down, and said:
“My dear Handel, I fear I shall soon have to leave you.”
His partner having prepared me for that, I was less surprised than
he thought.
“We shall lose a fine opportunity if I put off going to Cairo, and I
am very much afraid I must go, Handel, when you most need me.”
“Herbert, I shall always need you, because I shall always love you;
but my need is no greater now, than at another time.”
“You will be so lonely.”
“I have not leisure to think of that,” said I. “You know that I am
always with him to the full extent of the time allowed, and that I
should be with him all day long, if I could. And when I come away
from him, you know that my thoughts are with him.”
The dreadful condition to which he was brought, was so appalling
to both of us, that we could not refer to it in plainer words.
“My dear fellow,” said Herbert, “let the near prospect of our
separation––for, it is very near––be my justification for troubling
you about yourself. Have you thought of your future?”
“No, for I have been afraid to think of any future.”
“But yours cannot be dismissed; indeed, my dear dear Handel, it
must not be dismissed. I wish you would enter on it now, as far as a
few friendly words go, with me.”
410 Great Expectations
“I will,” said I.
“In this branch house of ours, Handel, we must have a––––”
I saw that his delicacy was avoiding the right word, so I said, “A
clerk.”
“A clerk. And I hope it is not at all unlikely that he may expand (as
a clerk of your acquaintance has expanded) into a partner. Now,
Handel––in short, my dear boy, will you come to me?”
There was something charmingly cordial and engaging in the
manner in which after saying “Now, Handel,” as if it were the grave
beginning of a portentous business exordium, he had suddenly given
up that tone, stretched out his honest hand, and spoken like a
schoolboy.
“Clara and I have talked about it again and again,” Herbert pursued, “and the dear little thing begged me only this evening, with
tears in her eyes, to say to you that if you will live with us when we
come together, she will do her best to make you happy, and to convince her husband’s friend that he is her friend too. We should get on
so well, Handel!”
I thanked her heartily, and I thanked him heartily, but said I could
not yet make sure of joining him as he so kindly offered. Firstly, my
mind was too preoccupied to be able to take in the subject clearly.
Secondly––––Yes! Secondly, there was a vague something lingering
in my thoughts that will come out very near the end of this slight
narrative.
“But if you thought, Herbert, that you could, without doing
any injury in your business, leave the question open for a little
while––––”
“For any while,” cried Herbert. “Six months, a year!”
“Not so long as that,” said I. “Two or three months at most.”
Herbert was highly delighted when we shook hands on this
arrangement, and said he could now take courage to tell me that he
believed he must go away at the end of the week.
“And Clara?” said I.
“The dear little thing,” returned Herbert, “holds dutifully to her
father as long as he lasts; but he won’t last long. Mrs. Whimple
confides to me that he is certainly going.”
“Not to say an unfeeling thing,” said I, “he cannot do better than
go.”
“I am afraid that must be admitted,” said Herbert: “and then I
lv] Volume III Chapter XVI 411
shall come back for the dear little thing, and the dear little thing and
I will walk quietly into the nearest church. Remember! The blessed
darling comes of no family, my dear Handel, and never looked into
the red book,* and hasn’t a notion about her grandpapa. What a
fortune for the son of my mother!”
On the Saturday in that same week, I took my leave of Herbert––
full of bright hope, but sad and sorry to leave me––as he sat on one
of the seaport mail coaches. I went into a coffee-house to write a little
note to Clara, telling her he had gone off, sending his love to her over
and over again, and then went to my lonely home––if it deserved the
name, for it was now no home to me, and I had no home anywhere.
On the stairs I encountered Wemmick, who was coming down,
after an unsuccessful application of his knuckles to my door. I had
not seen him alone, since the disastrous issue of the attempted flight;
and he had come, in his private and personal capacity, to say a few
words of explanation in reference to that failure.
“The late Compeyson,” said Wemmick, “had by little and little
got at the bottom of half of the regular business now transacted, and
it was from the talk of some of his people in trouble (some of his
people always being in trouble) that I heard what I did. I kept my
ears open, seeming to have them shut, until I heard that he was
absent, and I thought that would be the best time for making the
attempt. I can only suppose now, that it was a part of his policy, as a
very clever man, habitually to deceive his own instruments. You
don’t blame me, I hope, Mr. Pip? I am sure I tried to serve you, with
all my heart.”
“I am as sure of that, Wemmick, as you can be, and I thank you
most earnestly for all your interest and friendship.”
“Thank you, thank you very much. It’s a bad job,” said Wemmick,
scratching his head, “and I assure you I haven’t been so cut up for a
long time. What I look at, is the sacrifice of so much portable property. Dear me!”
“What I think of, Wemmick, is the poor owner of the property.”
“Yes, to be sure,” said Wemmick. “Of course there can be no
objection to your being sorry for him, and I’d put down a five-pound
note myself to get him out of it. But what I look at, is this. The late
Compeyson having been beforehand with him in intelligence of his
return, and being so determined to bring him to book, I do not think
he could have been saved. Whereas, the portable property certainly
412 Great Expectations
could have been saved. That’s the difference between the property
and the owner, don’t you see?”
I invited Wemmick to come up-stairs, and refresh himself with a
glass of grog before walking to Walworth. He accepted the invitation.
While he was drinking his moderate allowance, he said, with nothing
to lead up to it, and after having appeared rather fidgety:
“What do you think of my meaning to take a holiday on Monday,
Mr. Pip?”
“Why, I suppose you have not done such a thing these twelve
months.”
“These twelve years, more likely,” said Wemmick. “Yes. I’m going
to take a holiday. More than that; I’m going to take a walk. More than
that; I’m going to ask you to take a walk with me.”
I was about to excuse myself, as being but a bad companion just
then, when Wemmick anticipated me.
“I know your engagements,” said he, “and I know you are out of
sorts, Mr. Pip. But if you could oblige me, I should take it as a
kindness. It ain’t a long walk, and it’s an early one. Say it might
occupy you (including breakfast on the walk) from eight to twelve.
Couldn’t you stretch a point and manage it?”
 He had done so much for me at various times, that this was very
little to do for him. I said I could manage it––would manage it––and
he was so very much pleased by my acquiescence, that I was pleased
too. At his particular request, I appointed to call for him at the Castle
at half-past eight on Monday morning, and so we parted for the
time.
Punctual to my appointment, I rang at the Castle gate on the
Monday morning, and was received by Wemmick himself: who struck
me as looking tighter than usual, and having a sleeker hat on. Within,
there were two glasses of rum-and-milk prepared, and two biscuits.
The Aged must have been stirring with the lark, for, glancing into the
perspective of his bedroom, I observed that his bed was empty.
When we had fortified ourselves with the rum-and-milk and biscuits, and were going out for the walk with that training preparation
on us, I was considerably surprised to see Wemmick take up a
fishing-rod, and put it over his shoulder. “Why, we are not going
fishing!” said I. “No.” returned Wemmick, “but I like to walk with
one.”
I thought this odd; however, I said nothing, and we set off. We
lv] Volume III Chapter XVI 413
went towards Camberwell Green, and when we were thereabouts,
Wemmick said suddenly:
“Halloa! Here’s a church!”
There was nothing very surprising in that; but again, I was rather
surprised, when he said, as if he were animated by a brilliant idea:
“Let’s go in!”
We went in, Wemmick leaving his fishing-rod in the porch, and
looked all round. In the mean time, Wemmick was diving into his
coat-pockets, and getting something out of paper there.
“Halloa!” said he. “Here’s a couple of pair of gloves! Let’s put ’em
on!”
As the gloves were white kid gloves, and as the post-office was
widened to its utmost extent, I now began to have my strong suspicions. They were strengthened into certainty when I beheld the
Aged enter at a side door, escorting a lady.
“Halloa!” said Wemmick. “Here’s Miss Skiffins! Let’s have a
wedding.”
That discreet damsel was attired as usual, except that she was now
engaged in substituting for her green kid gloves, a pair of white. The
Aged was likewise occupied in preparing a similar sacrifice for the
altar of Hymen.* The old gentleman, however, experienced so much
difficulty in getting his gloves on, that Wemmick found it necessary
to put him with his back against a pillar, and then to get behind the
pillar himself and pull away at them, while I for my part held the old
gentleman round the waist, that he might present an equal and safe
resistance. By dint of this ingenious scheme, his gloves were got on
to perfection.
The clerk and clergyman then appearing, we were ranged in order
at those fatal rails. True to his notion of seeming to do it all without
preparation, I heard Wemmick say to himself as he took something
out of his waistcoat-pocket before the service began, “Halloa! Here’s
a ring!”
I acted in the capacity of backer, or best-man, to the bridegroom;
while a little limp pew opener* in a soft bonnet like a baby’s, made a
feint of being the bosom friend of Miss Skiffins. The responsibility
of giving the lady away, devolved upon the Aged, which led to the
clergyman’s being unintentionally scandalised, and it happened
thus. When he said, “Who giveth this woman to be married to this
man?” the old gentleman, not in the least knowing what point of the
414 Great Expectations
ceremony we had arrived at, stood most amiably beaming at the ten
commandments. Upon which, the clergyman said again, “Who
giveth this woman to be married to this man?” The old gentleman
being still in a state of most estimable unconsciousness, the bridegroom cried out in his accustomed voice, “Now Aged P. you know;
who giveth?” To which the Aged replied with great briskness, before
saying that he gave, “All right, John, all right, my boy!” And the
clergyman came to so gloomy a pause upon it, that I had doubts for
the moment whether we should get completely married that day.
It was completely done, however, and when we were going out of
church, Wemmick took the cover off the font, and put his white
gloves in it, and put the cover on again. Mrs. Wemmick, more heedful of the future, put her white gloves in her pocket and assumed her
green. “Now, Mr. Pip,” said Wemmick, triumphantly shouldering
the fishing-rod as we came out, “let me ask you whether anybody
would suppose this to be a wedding party!”
Breakfast had been ordered at a pleasant little tavern, a mile or so
away upon the rising-ground beyond the Green; and there was a
bagatelle board in the room, in case we should desire to unbend our
minds after the solemnity. It was pleasant to observe that Mrs.
Wemmick no longer unwound Wemmick’s arm when it adapted
itself to her figure, but sat in a high-backed chair against the wall,
like a violoncello in its case, and submitted to be embraced as that
melodious instrument might have done.
We had an excellent breakfast, and when any one declined anything on table, Wemmick said, “Provided by contract, you know;
don’t be afraid of it!” I drank to the new couple, drank to the Aged,
drank to the Castle, saluted the bride at parting and made myself as
agreeable as I could.
Wemmick came down to the door with me, and I again shook
hands with him, and wished him joy.
“Thankee!” said Wemmick, rubbing his hands. “She’s such a
manager of fowls you have no idea. You shall have some eggs, and
judge for yourself. I say, Mr. Pip!” calling me back, and speaking low.
“This is altogether a Walworth sentiment, please.”
“I understand. Not to be mentioned in Little Britain,” said I.
Wemmick nodded. “After what you let out the other day, Mr.
Jaggers may as well not know of it. He might think my brain was
softening, or something of the kind.”
lv] Volume III Chapter XVI 415
CHAPTER XVII
He lay in prison very ill, during the whole interval between his
committal for trial, and the coming round of the Sessions. He had
broken two ribs, they had wounded one of his lungs, and he breathed
with great pain and difficulty, which increased daily. It was a consequence of his hurt, that he spoke so low as to be scarcely audible;
therefore, he spoke very little. But, he was ever ready to listen to me,
and it became the first duty of my life to say to him, and read to him,
what I knew he ought to hear.
Being far too ill to remain in the common prison, he was removed,
after the first day or so, into the infirmary. This gave me opportunities of being with him that I could not otherwise have had. And but
for his illness he would have been put in irons, for he was regarded as
a determined prison-breaker, and I know not what else.
Although I saw him every day, it was for only a short time; hence,
the regularly recurring spaces of our separation were long enough to
record on his face any slight changes that occurred in his physical
state. I do not recollect that I once saw any change in it for the better;
he wasted, and became slowly weaker and worse, day by day, from
the day when the prison door closed upon him.
The kind of submission or resignation that he showed, was that of
a man who was tired out. I sometimes derived an impression, from
his manner or from a whispered word or two which escaped him,
that he pondered over the question whether he might have been a
better man under better circumstances. But, he never justified himself by a hint tending that way, or tried to bend the past out of its
eternal shape.
It happened on two or three occasions in my presence, that his
desperate reputation was alluded to by one or other of the people in
attendance on him. A smile crossed his face then, he turned his eyes
on me with a trustful look, as if he were confident that I had seen
some small redeeming touch in him, even so long ago as when I was a
little child. As to all the rest, he was humble and contrite, and I never
knew him complain.
When the Sessions came round, Mr. Jaggers caused an application
to be made for the postponement of his trial until the following
Sessions. It was obviously made with the assurance that he could not
416 Great Expectations
live so long, and was refused. The trial came on at once, and, when
he was put to the bar, he was seated in a chair. No objection was
made to my getting close to the dock, on the outside of it, and
holding the hand that he stretched forth to me.
The trial was very short and very clear. Such things as could be
said for him, were said––how he had taken to industrious habits, and
had thriven lawfully and reputably. But, nothing could unsay the fact
that he had returned, and was there in presence of the Judge and
Jury. It was impossible to try him for that, and do otherwise than find
him Guilty.
At that time, it was the custom (as I learnt from my terrible
experience of that Sessions) to devote a concluding day to the passing of Sentences, and to make a finishing effect with the Sentence of
Death. But for the indelible picture that my remembrance now holds
before me, I could scarcely believe, even as I write these words, that I
saw two-and-thirty men and women put before the Judge to receive
that sentence together. Foremost among the two-and-thirty, was he;
seated, that he might get breath enough to keep life in him.
The whole scene starts out again in the vivid colours of the
moment, down to the drops of April rain* on the windows of the
court, glittering in the rays of April sun. Penned in the dock, as I
again stood outside it at the corner with his hand in mine, were the
two-and-thirty men and women; some defiant, some stricken with
terror, some sobbing and weeping, some covering their faces, some
staring gloomily about. There had been shrieks from among the
women convicts, but they had been stilled, and a hush had succeeded. The sheriffs with their great chains and nosegays,* other
civic gewgaws and monsters, criers, ushers, a great gallery full of
people––a large theatrical audience––looked on, as the two-andthirty and the Judge were solemnly confronted. Then, the Judge
addressed them. Among the wretched creatures before him whom he
must single out for special address, was one who almost from his
infancy had been an offender against the laws; who, after repeated
imprisonments and punishments, had been at length sentenced to
exile for a term of years; and who, under circumstances of great
violence and daring had made his escape and been re-sentenced to
exile for life. That miserable man would seem for a time to have
become convinced of his errors, when far removed from the scenes
of his old offences, and to have lived a peaceable and honest life. But
lvi] Volume III Chapter XVII 417
in a fatal moment, yielding to those propensities and passions, the
indulgence of which had so long rendered him a scourge to society,
he had quitted his haven of rest and repentance, and had come back
to the country where he was proscribed. Being here presently
denounced, he had for a time succeeded in evading the officers of
Justice, but being at length seized while in the act of flight, he had
resisted them, and had––he best knew whether by express design, or
in the blindness of his hardihood––caused the death of his
denouncer, to whom his whole career was known. The appointed
punishment for his return to the land that had cast him out, being
Death, and his case being this aggravated case, he must prepare
himself to Die.
The sun was striking in at the great windows of the court, through
the glittering drops of rain upon the glass, and it made a broad shaft
of light between the two-and-thirty and the Judge, linking both
together, and perhaps reminding some among the audience, how
both were passing on, with absolute equality, to the greater Judgment
that knoweth all things and cannot err. Rising for a moment, a distinct speck of face in this way of light, the prisoner said, “My Lord, I
have received my sentence of Death from the Almighty, but I bow to
yours,” and sat down again. There was some hushing, and the Judge
went on with what he had to say to the rest. Then, they were all
formally doomed, and some of them were supported out, and some of
them sauntered out with a haggard look of bravery, and a few nodded
to the gallery, and two or three shook hands, and others went out
chewing the fragments of herb they had taken from the sweet herbs
lying about. He went last of all, because of having to be helped from
his chair and to go very slowly; and he held my hand while all the
others were removed, and while the audience got up (putting their
dresses right, as they might at church or elsewhere) and pointed
down at this criminal or that, and most of all at him and me.
I earnestly hoped and prayed that he might die before the
Recorder’s Report was made, but, in the dread of his lingering on, I
began that night to write out a petition to the Home Secretary of
State, setting forth my knowledge of him, and how it was that he had
come back for my sake. I wrote it as fervently and pathetically as I
could, and when I had finished it and sent it in, I wrote out other
petitions to such men in authority as I hoped were the most merciful,
and drew up one to the Crown itself. For several days and nights
418 Great Expectations
after he was sentenced I took no rest except when I fell asleep in my
chair, but was wholly absorbed in these appeals. And after I had sent
them in, I could not keep away from the places where they were, but
felt as if they were more hopeful and less desperate when I was near
them. In this unreasonable restlessness and pain of mind, I would
roam the streets of an evening, wandering by those offices and
houses where I had left the petitions. To the present hour, the weary
western streets of London on a cold dusty spring night, with their
ranges of stern shut-up mansions and their long rows of lamps, are
melancholy to me from this association.
The daily visits I could make him were shortened now, and he was
more strictly kept. Seeing, or fancying, that I was suspected of an
intention of carrying poison to him, I asked to be searched before I
sat down at his bedside, and told the officer who was always there,
that I was willing to do anything that would assure him of the singleness of my designs. Nobody was hard with him, or with me. There
was duty to be done, and it was done, but not harshly. The officer
always gave me the assurance that he was worse, and some other sick
prisoners in the room, and some other prisoners who attended on
them as sick nurses (malefactors, but not incapable of kindess, God
be thanked!), always joined in the same report.
As the days went on, I noticed more and more that he would lie
placidly looking at the white ceiling, with an absence of light in his
face, until some word of mine brightened it for an instant, and then it
would subside again. Sometimes he was almost, or quite, unable to
speak; then, he would answer me with slight pressures on my hand,
and I grew to understand his meaning very well.
The number of the days had risen to ten, when I saw a greater
change in him than I had seen yet. His eyes were turned towards the
door, and lighted up as I entered.
“Dear boy,” he said, as I sat down by his bed: “I thought you was
late. But I knowed you couldn’t be that.”
“It is just the time,” said I. “I waited for it at the gate.”
“You always waits at the gate; don’t you, dear boy?”
“Yes. Not to lose a moment of the time.”
“Thank’ee dear boy, thank’ee. God bless you! You’ve never deserted me, dear boy.”
I pressed his hand in silence, for I could not forget that I had once
meant to desert him.
lvi] Volume III Chapter XVII 419
“And what’s the best of all,” he said, “you’ve been more comfortable alonger me, since I was under a dark cloud, than when the sun
shone. That’s best of all.”
He lay on his back, breathing with great difficulty. Do what he
would, and love me though he did, the light left his face ever and
again, and a film came over the placid look at the white ceiling.
“Are you in much pain to-day?”
“I don’t complain of none, dear boy.”
“You never do complain.”
He had spoken his last words. He smiled, and I understood his
touch to mean that he wished to lift my hand, and lay it on his breast.
I laid it there, and he smiled again, and put both his hands upon it.
The allotted time ran out, while we were thus; but, looking round,
I found the governor of the prison standing near me, and he whispered, “You needn’t go yet.” I thanked him gratefully, and asked,
“Might I speak to him, if he can hear me?”
The governor stepped aside, and beckoned the officer away. The
change, though it was made without noise, drew back the film from
the placid look at the white ceiling, and he looked most affectionately
at me.
“Dear Magwitch, I must tell you, now at last. You understand
what I say?”
A gentle pressure on my hand.
“You had a child once, whom you loved and lost.”
A stronger pressure on my hand.
“She lived and found powerful friends. She is living now. She is a
lady and very beautiful. And I love her!”
With a last faint effort, which would have been powerless but for
my yielding to it and assisting it, he raised my hand to his lips. Then,
he gently let it sink upon his breast again, with his own hands lying
on it. The placid look at the white ceiling came back, and passed
away, and his head dropped quietly on his breast.
Mindful, then, of what we had read together, I thought of the two
men who went up into the Temple to pray, and I knew there were no
better words that I could say beside his bed, than “O Lord, be
merciful to him, a sinner!”*
420 Great Expectations
CHAPTER XVIII
Now that I was left wholly to myself, I gave notice of my intention
to quit the chambers in the Temple as soon as my tenancy could
legally determine, and in the mean while to underlet* them. At once
I put bills up in the windows; for, I was in debt, and had scarcely any
money, and began to be seriously alarmed by the state of my affairs. I
ought rather to write that I should have been alarmed if I had had
energy and concentration enough to help me to the clear perception
of any truth beyond the fact that I was falling very ill. The late stress
upon me had enabled me to put off illness, but not to put it away; I
knew that it was coming on me now, and I knew very little else, and
was even careless as to that.
For a day or two, I lay on the sofa, or on the floor––anywhere,
according as I happened to sink down––with a heavy head and aching limbs, and no purpose, and no power. Then there came, one
night which appeared of great duration, and which teemed with
anxiety and horror; and when in the morning I tried to sit up in my
bed and think of it, I found I could not do so.
Whether I really had been down in Garden-court in the dead of
the night, groping about for the boat that I supposed to be there;
whether I had two or three times come to myself on the staircase
with great terror, not knowing how I had got out of bed; whether I
had found myself lighting the lamp, possessed by the idea that he
was coming up the stairs, and that the lights were blown out;
whether I had been inexpressibly harassed by the distracted talking,
laughing, and groaning, of some one, and had half suspected those
sounds to be of my own making; whether there had been a closed
iron furnace in a dark corner of the room, and a voice had called out
over and over again that Miss Havisham was consuming within it;
these were things that I tried to settle with myself and get into some
order, as I lay that morning on my bed. But, the vapour of a limekiln
would come between me and them, disordering them all, and it was
through the vapour at last that I saw two men looking at me.
“What do you want?” I asked, starting; “I don’t know you.”
“Well, sir,” returned one of them, bending down and touching me
on the shoulder, “this is a matter that you’ll soon arrange, I dare say,
but you’re arrested.”
lvii] Volume III Chapter XVIII 421
“What is the debt?”
“Hundred and twenty-three pound, fifteen, six. Jeweller’s
account, I think.”
“What is to be done?”
“You had better come to my house,*” said the man. “I keep a very
nice house.”
I made some attempt to get up and dress myself. When I next
attended to them, they were standing a little off from the bed, looking at me. I still lay there.
“You see my state,” said I. “I would come with you if I could; but
indeed I am quite unable. If you take me from here, I think I shall die
by the way.”
Perhaps they replied, or argued the point, or tried to encourage
me to believe that I was better than I thought. Forasmuch as they
hang in my memory by only this one slender thread, I don’t know
what they did, except that they forbore to remove me.
That I had a fever and was avoided, that I suffered greatly, that I
often lost my reason, that the time seemed interminable, that I confounded impossible existences with my own identity; that I was a
brick in the house-wall, and yet entreating to be released from the
giddy place where the builders had set me; that I was a steel beam of
a vast engine, clashing and whirling over a gulf, and yet that I
implored in my own person to have the engine stopped, and my part
in it hammered off; that I passed through these phases of disease, I
know of my own remembrance, and did in some sort know at the
time. That I sometimes struggled with real people, in the belief that
they were murderers, and that I would all at once comprehend that
they meant to do me good, and would then sink exhausted in their
arms, and suffer them to lay me down, I also knew at the time. But,
above all, I knew that there was a consistent tendency in all these
people––who, when I was very ill, would present all kinds of extraordinary transformations of the human face, and would be much
dilated in size––above all, I say, I knew that there was an extraordinary tendency in all these people sooner or later to settle down into
the likeness of Joe.
After I had turned the worst point of my illness, I began to notice
that while all its other features changed, this one consistent feature
did not change. Whoever came about me, still settled down into Joe.
I opened my eyes in the night, and I saw in the great chair at the
422 Great Expectations
bedside, Joe. I opened my eyes in the day, and, sitting on the
window-seat, smoking his pipe in the shaded open window, still I
saw Joe. I asked for cooling drink, and the dear hand that gave it me
was Joe’s. I sank back on my pillow after drinking, and the face that
looked so hopefully and tenderly upon me was the face of Joe.
At last, one day, I took courage, and said, “Is it Joe?”
And the dear old home-voice answered, “Which it air, old chap.”
“O Joe, you break my heart! Look angry at me, Joe. Strike me, Joe.
Tell me of my ingratitude. Don’t be so good to me!”
For, Joe had actually laid his head down on the pillow at my side
and put his arm round my neck, in his joy that I knew him.
“Which dear old Pip, old chap,” said Joe, “you and me was ever
friends. And when you’re well enough to go out for a ride––what larks!”
After which, Joe withdrew to the window, and stood with his back
towards me, wiping his eyes. And as my extreme weakness prevented
me from getting up and going to him, I lay there, penitently whispering, “O God bless him! O God bless this gentle Christian man!”
Joe’s eyes were red when I next found him beside me; but, I was
holding his hand, and we both felt happy.
“How long, dear Joe?”
“Which you meantersay, Pip, how long have your illness lasted,
dear old chap?”
“Yes, Joe.”
“It’s the end of May, Pip. To-morrow is the first of June.”
“And have you been here all the time, dear Joe?”
“Pretty nigh, old chap. For, as I says to Biddy when the news of
your being ill were brought by letter, which it were brought by the
post and being formerly single he is now married though underpaid
for a deal of walking and shoe-leather, but wealth were not a object
on his part, and marriage were the great wish of his hart––––”
“It is so delightful to hear you, Joe! But I interrupt you in what
you said to Biddy.”
“Which it were,” said Joe, “that how you might be among
strangers, and that how you and me having been ever friends, a wisit
at such a moment might not prove unacceptabobble. And Biddy, her
word were, ‘Go to him, without loss of time.’ That,” said Joe, summing up with his judicial air, “were the word of Biddy. ‘Go to him,’
Biddy say, ‘without loss of time.’ In short, I shouldn’t greatly deceive
you,” Joe added, after a little grave reflection, “if I represented to
lvii] Volume III Chapter XVIII 423
you that the word of that young woman were, ‘without a minute’s
loss of time’.”
There Joe cut himself short, and informed me that I was to be
talked to in great moderation, and that I was to take a little nourishment at stated frequent times, whether I felt inclined for it or not,
and that I was to submit myself to all his orders. So, I kissed his
hand, and lay quiet, while he proceeded to indite a note to Biddy,
with my love in it.
Evidently, Biddy had taught Joe to write. As I lay in bed looking at
him, it made me, in my weak state, cry again with pleasure to see the
pride with which he set about his letter. My bedstead, divested of its
curtains, had been removed, with me upon it, into the sitting-room,
as the airiest and largest, and the carpet had been taken away, and the
room kept always fresh and wholesome night and day. At my own
writing-table, pushed into a corner and cumbered with little bottles,
Joe now sat down to his great work, first choosing a pen from the
pen-tray as if it were a chest of large tools, and tucking up his sleeves
as if he were going to wield a crowbar or sledge-hammer. It was
necessary for Joe to hold on heavily to the table with his left elbow,
and to get his right leg well out behind him, before he could begin,
and when he did begin, he made every down-stroke so slowly that it
might have been six feet long, while at every up-stroke I could hear
his pen spluttering extensively. He had a curious idea that the inkstand was on the side of him where it was not, and constantly dipped
his pen into space, and seemed quite satisfied with the result.
Occasionally, he was tripped up by some orthographical stumblingblock, but on the whole he got on very well indeed, and when he had
signed his name, and had removed a finishing blot from the paper to
the crown of his head with his two forefingers, he got up and hovered
about the table, trying the effect of his performance from various
points of view as it lay there, with unbounded satisfaction.
Not to make Joe uneasy by talking too much, even if I had been
able to talk much, I deferred asking him about Miss Havisham until
next day. He shook his head when I then asked him if she had
recovered.
“Is she dead, Joe?”
“Why you see, old chap,” said Joe, in a tone of remonstrance, and
by way of getting at it by degrees, “I wouldn’t go so far as to say that,
for that’s a deal to say; but she ain’t––––”
424 Great Expectations
“Living, Joe?”
“That’s nigher where it is,” said Joe; “she ain’t living.”
“Did she linger long, Joe?”
“Arter you was took ill, pretty much about what you might call (if
you was put to it) a week,” said Joe; still determined, on my account,
to come at everything by degrees.
“Dear Joe, have you heard what becomes of her property?”
“Well, old chap,” said Joe, “it do appear that she had settled the
most of it, which I meantersay tied it up, on Miss Estella. But she
had wrote out a little coddleshell* in her own hand a day or two
afore the accident, leaving a cool four thousand to Mr. Matthew
Pocket. And why, do you suppose, above all things, Pip, she left that
cool four thousand to him? ‘Because of Pip’s account of him the said
Matthew.’ I am told by Biddy, that air the writing,” said Joe, repeating the legal turn as if it did him infinite good, “ ‘account of him the
said Matthew.’ And a cool four thousand, Pip!”
I never discovered from whom Joe derived the conventional temperature of the four thousand pounds, but it appeared to make the
sum of money more to him, and he had a manifest relish in insisting
on its being cool.
This account gave me great joy, as it perfected the only good thing
I had done. I asked Joe whether he had heard if any of the other
relations had any legacies?
“Miss Sarah,” said Joe, “she have twenty-five pound perannium
fur to buy pills, on account of being bilious. Miss Georgiana, she
have twenty pound down. Mrs.––what’s the name of them wild
beasts with humps, old chap?”
“Camels?” said I, wondering why he could possibly want to know.
Joe nodded. “Mrs. Camels,” by which I presently understood he
meant Camilla, “she have five pound fur to buy rushlights to put her
in spirits when she wake up in the night.”
The accuracy of these recitals was sufficiently obvious to me, to
give me great confidence in Joe’s information. “And now,” said Joe,
“you ain’t that strong yet, old chap, that you can take in more nor
one additional shovel-full to-day. Old Orlick he’s been a bustin’ open
a dwelling-ouse.”
“Whose?” said I.
“Not, I grant you, but what his manners is given to blusterous,”
said Joe, apologetically; “still, a Englishman’s ouse is his Castle, and
lvii] Volume III Chapter XVIII 425
castles must not be busted ’cept when done in war time. And wotsume’er the failings on his part, he were a corn and seedsman in his
hart.”
“Is it Pumblechook’s house that has been broken into, then?”
“That’s it, Pip,” said Joe; “and they took his till, and they took his
cash-box, and they drinked his wine, and they partook of his wittles,
and they slapped his face, and they pulled his nose, and they tied him
up to his bedpust, and they giv’ him a dozen, and they stuffed his
mouth full of flowering annuals to prewent his crying out. But he
knowed Orlick, and Orlick’s in the county jail.”
By these approaches we arrived at unrestricted conversation. I was
slow to gain strength, but I did slowly and surely become less weak,
and Joe stayed with me, and I fancied I was little Pip again.
For, the tenderness of Joe was so beautifully proportioned to my
need, that I was like a child in his hands. He would sit and talk to
me in the old confidence, and with the old simplicity, and in the old
unassertive protecting way, so that I would half believe that all my
life since the days of the old kitchen was one of the mental troubles
of the fever that was gone. He did everything for me except the
household work, for which he had engaged a very decent woman,
after paying off the laundress on his first arrival. “Which I do
assure you, Pip,” he would often say, in explanation of that liberty;
“I found her a tapping the spare bed, like a cask of beer, and
drawing off the feathers in a bucket, for sale. Which she would have
tapped yourn next, and draw’d it off with you a laying on it, and
was then a carrying away the coals gradiwally in the soup-tureen
and wegetable dishes, and the wine and spirits in your Wellington
boots.”
We looked forward to the day when I should go out for a ride, as
we had once looked forward to the day of my apprenticeship. And
when the day came, and an open carriage was got into the Lane, Joe
wrapped me up, took me in his arms, carried me down to it, and put
me in, as if I were still the small helpless creature to whom he had so
abundantly given of the wealth of his great nature.
And Joe got in beside me, and we drove away together into the
country, where the rich summer growth was already on the trees and
on the grass, and sweet summer scents filled all the air. The day
happened to be Sunday, and when I looked on the loveliness around
me, and thought how it had grown and changed, and how the little
426 Great Expectations
wild flowers had been forming, and the voices of the birds had been
strengthening, by day and by night, under the sun and under the
stars, while poor I lay burning and tossing on my bed, the mere
remembrance of having burned and tossed there, came like a check
upon my peace. But, when I heard the Sunday bells, and looked
around a little more upon the outspread beauty, I felt that I was not
nearly thankful enough––that I was too weak yet, to be even that––
and I laid my head on Joe’s shoulder, as I had laid it long ago when
he had taken me to the Fair or where not, and it was too much for my
young senses.
More composure came to me after a while, and we talked as we
used to talk, lying on the grass at the old Battery. There was no
change whatever in Joe. Exactly what he had been in my eyes then,
he was in my eyes still; just as simply faithful, and as simply right.
When we got back again and he lifted me out, and carried me––so
easily––across the court and up the stairs, I thought of that eventful
Christmas Day when he had carried me over the marshes. We had
not yet made any allusion to my change of fortune, nor did I know
how much of my late history he was acquainted with. I was so
doubtful of myself now, and put so much trust in him, that I could
not satisfy myself whether I ought to refer to it when he did not.
“Have you heard, Joe,” I asked him that evening, upon further
consideration, as he smoked his pipe at the window, “who my patron
was?”
“I heerd,” returned Joe, “as it were not Miss Havisham, old chap.”
“Did you hear who it was, Joe?”
“Well! I heerd as it were a person what sent the person what giv’
you the bank-notes at the Jolly Bargemen, Pip.”
“So it was.”
“Astonishing!” said Joe, in the placidest way.
“Did you hear that he was dead, Joe?” I presently asked, with
increasing diffidence.
“Which? Him as sent the bank-notes, Pip?”
“Yes.”
“I think,” said Joe, after meditating a long time, and looking
rather evasively at the window-seat, “as I did hear tell that how he
were something or another in a general way in that direction.”
“Did you hear anything of his circumstances, Joe?”
“Not partickler, Pip.”
lvii] Volume III Chapter XVIII 427
“If you would like to hear, Joe––––” I was beginning, when Joe
got up and came to my sofa.
“Lookee here, old chap,” said Joe, bending over me. “Ever the best
of friends; ain’t us, Pip?”
I was ashamed to answer him.
“Wery good, then,” said Joe, as if I had answered; “that’s all right;
that’s agreed upon. Then why go into subjects, old chap, which as
betwixt two sech must be for ever onnecessary? There’s subjects
enough as betwixt two sech, without onnecessary ones. Lord! To
think of your poor sister and her Rampages! And don’t you remember Tickler?”
“I do indeed, Joe.”
“Lookee here, old chap,” said Joe. “I done what I could to keep you
and Tickler in sunders, but my power were not always fully equal to
my inclinations. For when your poor sister had a mind to drop into
you, it were notsermuch,” said Joe, in his favourite argumentative
way, “that she dropped into me too, if I put myself in opposition to
her but that she dropped into you always heavier for it. I noticed that.
It ain’t a grab at a man’s whisker, nor yet a shake or two of a man (to
which your sister was quite welcome), that ’ud put a man off from
getting a little child out of punishment. But when that little child is
dropped into, heavier, for that grab of whisker or shaking, then that
man naterally up and says to himself, ‘Where is the good as you are a
doing? I grant you I see the ’arm,’ says the man, ‘but I don’t see the
good. I call upon you, sir, theerfore, to pint out the good.’ ”
“The man says?” I observed, as Joe waited for me to speak.
“The man says,” Joe assented. “Is he right, that man?”
“Dear Joe, he is always right.”
“Well, old chap,” said Joe, “then abide by your words. If he’s
always right (which in general he’s more likely wrong), he’s right
when he says this:––Supposing ever you kep any little matter to
yourself, when you was a little child, you kep it mostly because you
know’d as J. Gargery’s power to part you and Tickler in sunders,
were not fully equal to his inclinations. Theerfore, think no more of
it as betwixt two sech, and do not let us pass remarks upon onnecessary subjects. Biddy giv’ herself a deal o’ trouble with me afore I left
(for I am most awful dull), as I should view it in this light, and,
viewing it in this light, as I shouldser put it. Both of which,” said Joe,
quite charmed with his logical arrangement, “being done, now this
428 Great Expectations
to you a true friend, say. Namely. You mustn’t go a over-doing on it,
but you must have your supper and your wine-and-water, and you
must be put betwixt the sheets.”
The delicacy with which Joe dismissed this theme, and the sweet
tact and kindness with which Biddy––who with her woman’s wit had
found me out so soon––had prepared him for it, made a deep
impression on my mind. But whether Joe knew how poor I was, and
how my great expectations had all dissolved, like our own marsh
mists before the sun, I could not understand.
Another thing in Joe that I could not understand when it first
began to develop itself, but which I soon arrived at a sorrowful
comprehension of, was this: As I became stronger and better, Joe
became a little less easy with me. In my weakness and entire dependence on him the dear fellow had fallen into the old tone, and called
me by the old names, the dear “old Pip, old chap,” that now were
music in my ears. I too had fallen into the old ways, only happy and
thankful that he let me. But, imperceptibly, though I held by them
fast, Joe’s hold upon them began to slacken; and whereas I wondered
at this, at first, I soon began to understand that the cause of it was in
me, and that the fault of it was all mine.
Ah! Had I given Joe no reason to doubt my constancy, and to think
that in prosperity I should grow cold to him and cast him off ? Had I
given Joe’s innocent heart no cause to feel instinctively that as I got
stronger, his hold upon me would be weaker, and that he had better
loosen it in time and let me go, before I plucked myself away?
It was on the third or fourth occasion of my going out walking in
the Temple Gardens leaning on Joe’s arm, that I saw this change in
him very plainly. We had been sitting in the bright warm sunlight,
looking at the river, and I chanced to say as we got up:
“See, Joe! I can walk quite strongly. Now, you shall see me walk
back by myself.”
“Which do not over-do it, Pip,” said Joe; “but I shall be happy fur
to see you able, sir.”
The last word grated on me; but how could I remonstrate! I
walked no further than the gate of the gardens, and then pretended
to be weaker than I was, and asked Joe for his arm. Joe gave it me, but
was thoughtful.
I, for my part, was thoughtful too; for, how best to check this
growing change in Joe, was a great perplexity to my remorseful
lvii] Volume III Chapter XVIII 429
thoughts. That I was ashamed to tell him exactly how I was placed,
and what I had come down to, I do not seek to conceal; but, I hope
my reluctance was not quite an unworthy one. He would want to
help me out of his little savings, I knew, and I knew that he ought not
to help me, and that I must not suffer him to do it.
It was a thoughtful evening with both of us. But, before we went
to bed, I had resolved that I would wait over to-morrow, to-morrow
being Sunday, and would begin my new course with the new week.
On Monday morning I would speak to Joe about this change, I
would lay aside this last vestige of reserve, I would tell him what I
had in my thoughts (that Secondly, not yet arrived at), and why I had
not decided to go out to Herbert, and then the change would be
conquered for ever. As I cleared, Joe cleared, and it seemed as
though he had sympathetically arrived at a resolution too.
We had a quiet day on the Sunday, and we rode out into the
country, and then walked in the fields.
“I feel thankful that I have been ill, Joe,” I said.
“Dear old Pip, old chap, you’re a’most come round, sir.”
“It has been a memorable time for me, Joe.”
“Likeways for myself, sir,” Joe returned.
“We have had a time together, Joe, that I can never forget. There
were days once, I know, that I did for a while forget; but I never shall
forget these.”
“Pip,” said Joe, appearing a little hurried and troubled, “there has
been larks. And, dear sir, what have been betwixt us––have been.”
At night, when I had gone to bed, Joe came into my room, as he
had done all through my recovery. He asked me if I felt sure that I
was as well as in the morning?
“Yes, dear Joe, quite.”
“And are always a getting stronger, old chap?”
“Yes, dear Joe, steadily.”
Joe patted the coverlet on my shoulder with his great good hand,
and said, in what I thought a husky voice, “Good night!”
When I got up in the morning, refreshed and stronger yet, I was
full of my resolution to tell Joe all, without delay. I would tell him
before breakfast. I would dress at once and go to his room and
surprise him; for, it was the first day I had been up early. I went to his
room, and he was not there. Not only was he not there, but his box
was gone.
430 Great Expectations
I hurried then to the breakfast-table, and on it found a letter.
These were its brief contents.
“Not wishful to intrude I have departured fur you are well again dear Pip
and will do better without “Jo.
“P.S. Ever the best of friends.”
Enclosed in the letter, was a receipt for the debt and costs on
which I had been arrested. Down to that moment I had vainly supposed that my creditor had withdrawn or suspended proceedings
until I should be quite recovered. I had never dreamed of Joe’s
having paid the money; but, Joe had paid it, and the receipt was in
his name.
 What remained for me now, but to follow him to the dear old
forge, and there to have out my disclosure to him, and my penitent
remonstrance with him, and there to relieve my mind and heart of
that reserved Secondly, which had begun as a vague something lingering in my thoughts, and had formed into a settled purpose?
The purpose was, that I would go to Biddy, that I would show her
how humbled and repentant I came back, that I would tell her how I
had lost all I once hoped for, that I would remind her of our old
confidences in my first unhappy time. Then, I would say to her,
“Biddy, I think you once liked me very well, when my errant heart,
even while it strayed away from you, was quieter and better with you
than it ever has been since. If you can like me only half as well once
more, if you can take me with all my faults and disappointments on
my head, if you can receive me like a forgiven child (and indeed I am
as sorry, Biddy, and have as much need of a hushing voice and a
soothing hand), I hope I am a little worthier of you than I was––not
much, but a little. And, Biddy, it shall rest with you to say whether I
shall work at the forge with Joe, or whether I shall try for any different occupation down in this country, or whether we shall go away to
a distant place where an opportunity awaits me, which I set aside
when it was offered, until I knew your answer. And now, dear Biddy,
if you can tell me that you will go through the world with me, you
will surely make it a better world for me, and me a better man for it,
and I will try hard to make it a better world for you.”
Such was my purpose. After three days more of recovery, I went
down to the old place, to put it in execution; and how I sped in it, is
all I have left to tell.
lvii] Volume III Chapter XVIII 431
CHAPTER XIX
The tidings of my high fortunes having had a heavy fall, had got
down to my native place and its neighbourhood, before I got there. I
found the Blue Boar in possession of the intelligence, and I found
that it made a great change in the Boar’s demeanour. Whereas the
Boar had cultivated my good opinion with warm assiduity when I
was coming into property, the Boar was exceedingly cool on the
subject now that I was going out of property.
It was evening when I arrived, much fatigued by the journey I had
so often made so easily. The Boar could not put me into my usual
bedroom, which was engaged (probably by some one who had
expectations), and could only assign me a very indifferent chamber
among the pigeons and post-chaises up the yard. But, I had as sound
a sleep in that lodging as in the most superior accommodation the
Boar could have given me, and the quality of my dreams was about
the same as in the best bedroom.
Early in the morning while my breakfast was getting ready, I
strolled round by Satis House. There were printed bills on the
gate, and on bits of carpet hanging out of the windows, announcing
the sale by auction of the Household Furniture and Effects, next
week. The House itself was to be sold as old building materials and
pulled down. Lot 1 was marked in whitewashed knock-knee letters
on the brewhouse; Lot 2 on that part of the main building which
had been so long shut up. Other lots were marked off on other
parts of the structure, and the ivy had been torn down to make
room for the inscriptions, and much of it trailed low in the dust
and was withered already. Stepping in for a moment at the open
gate and looking around me with the uncomfortable air of a
stranger who had no business there, I saw the auctioneer’s clerk
walking on the casks and telling them off for the information of
a catalogue-compiler, pen in hand, who made a temporary desk
of the wheeled chair I had so often pushed along to the tune of
Old Clem.
When I got back to my breakfast in the Boar’s coffee-room, I
found Mr. Pumblechook conversing with the landlord. Mr. Pumblechook (not improved in appearance by his late nocturnal adventure)
was waiting for me, and addressed me in the following terms:
432 Great Expectations
“Young man, I am sorry to see you brought low. But what else
could be expected! What else could be expected!”
As he extended his hand with a magnificently forgiving air, and as
I was broken by illness and unfit to quarrel, I took it.
“William,” said Mr. Pumblechook to the waiter, “put a muffin on
table. And has it come to this! Has it come to this!”
I frowningly sat down to my breakfast. Mr. Pumblechook stood
over me and poured out my tea––before I could touch the teapot––with the air of a benefactor who was resolved to be true to
the last.
“William,” said Mr. Pumblechook, mournfully, “put the salt on.
In happier times,” addressing me, “I think you took sugar? And did
you take milk? You did. Sugar and milk. William, bring a
watercress.”
“Thank you,” said I, shortly, “but I don’t eat watercresses.”
“You don’t eat ’em,” returned Mr. Pumblechook, sighing and
nodding his head several times, as if he might have expected that,
and as if abstinence from watercresses were consistent with my
downfall. “True. The simple fruits of the earth. No. You needn’t
bring any, William.”
I went on with my breakfast, and Mr. Pumblechook continued to
stand over me, staring fishily and breathing noisily, as he always did.
“Little more than skin and bone!” mused Mr. Pumblechook,
aloud. “And yet when he went away from here (I may say with my
blessing), and I spread afore him my humble store, like the Bee,* he
was as plump as a Peach!’
This reminded me of the wonderful difference between the servile
manner in which he had offered his hand in my new prosperity,
saying, “May I?” and the ostentatious clemency with which he had
just now exhibited the same fat five fingers.
“Hah!” he went on, handing me the bread-and-butter. “And air
you a going to Joseph?”
“In Heaven’s name,” said I, firing in spite of myself, “what does it
matter to you where I am going? Leave that tea-pot alone.”
It was the worst course I could have taken, because it gave
Pumblechook the opportunity he wanted.
“Yes, young man,” said he, releasing the handle of the article in
question, retiring a step or two from my table, and speaking for
the behoof of the landlord and waiter at the door, “I will leave that
lviii] Volume III Chapter XIX 433
tea-pot alone. You are right, young man. For once, you are right.
I forgit myself when I take such an interest in your breakfast,
as to wish your frame, exhausted by the debilitating effects of
prodigygality, to be stimulated by the ’olesome nourishment of your
forefathers. And yet,” said Pumblechook, turning to the landlord
and waiter, and pointing me out at arm’s length, “this is him as I ever
sported with in his days of happy infancy! Tell me not it cannot be; I
tell you this is him!”
A low murmur from the two replied. The waiter appeared to be
particularly affected.
“This is him,” said Pumblechook, “as I have rode in my shay-cart.
This is him as I have seen brought up by hand. This is him untoe the
sister of which I was uncle by marriage, as her name was Georgiana
M’ria from her own mother, let him deny it if he can!”
The waiter seemed convinced that I could not deny it, and that it
gave the case a black look.
“Young man,” said Pumblechook, screwing his head at me in the
old fashion, “you air a going to Joseph. What does it matter to me,
you ask me, where you air a going? I say to you, Sir, you air a going to
Joseph.”
The waiter coughed, as if he modestly invited me to get over that.
“Now,” said Pumblechook, and all this with a most exasperating
air of saying in the cause of virtue what was perfectly convincing and
conclusive, “I will tell you what to say to Joseph. Here is Squires of
the Boar present, known and respected in this town, and here is
William, which his father’s name was Potkins if I do not deceive
myself.”
“You do not, sir,” said William.
“In their presence,” pursued Pumblechook, “I will tell you, young
man, what to say to Joseph. Says you, ‘Joseph, I have this day seen
my earliest benefactor and the founder of my fortun’s. I will name no
names, Joseph, but so they are pleased to call him up-town, and I
have seen that man.’ ”
“I swear I don’t see him here,” said I.
“Say that likewise,” retorted Pumblechook. “Say you said that,
and even Joseph will probably betray surprise.”
“There you quite mistake him,” said I. “I know better.”
“Says you,” Pumblechook went on. “ ‘Joseph, I have seen that
man, and that man bears you no malice and bears me no malice. He
434 Great Expectations
knows your character, Joseph, and is well acquainted with your pigheadedness and ignorance; and he knows my character, Joseph, and
he knows my want of gratitoode. Yes, Joseph,’ says you,” here Pumblechook shook his head and hand at me, “ ‘he knows my total
deficiency of common human gratitoode. He knows it, Joseph, as
none can. You do not know it, Joseph, having no call to know it, but
that man do.’ ”
Windy donkey as he was, it really amazed me that he could have
the face to talk thus to mine.
“Says you, ‘Joseph, he gave me a little message, which I will now
repeat. It was, that in my being brought low, he saw the finger of
Providence. He knowed that finger when he saw it, Joseph, and he
saw it plain. It pinted out this writing, Joseph. Reward of ingratitoode
to earliest benefactor, and founder of fortun’s. But that man said that he
did not repent of what he had done, Joseph. Not at all. It was right to
do it, it was kind to do it, it was benevolent to do it, and he would do
it again.’ ”
“It’s a pity,” said I, scornfully, as I finished my interrupted breakfast, “that the man did not say what he had done and would do
again.”
“Squires of the Boar!” Pumblechook was now addressing the landlord, “and William! I have no objections to your mentioning, either
up-town or down-town, if such should be your wishes, that it was
right to do it, kind to do it, benevolent to do it, and that I would do it
again.”
With those words the Impostor shook them both by the hand,
with an air, and left the house; leaving me much more astonished
than delighted by the virtues of that same indefinite “it.” I was not
long after him in leaving the house too, and when I went down the
High-Street I saw him holding forth (no doubt to the same effect) at
his shop door to a select group, who honoured me with very
unfavourable glances as I passed on the opposite side of the way.
But, it was only the pleasanter to turn to Biddy and to Joe, whose
great forbearance shone more brightly than before, if that could be,
contrasted with this brazen pretender. I went towards them slowly,
for my limbs were weak, but with a sense of increasing relief as I
drew nearer to them, and a sense of leaving arrogance and
untruthfulness further and further behind.
The June weather was delicious. The sky was blue, the larks were
lviii] Volume III Chapter XIX 435
soaring high over the green corn, I thought all that country-side
more beautiful and peaceful by far than I had ever known it to be yet.
Many pleasant pictures of the life I would lead there, and of the
change for the better that would come over my character when I had
a guiding spirit at my side whose simple faith and clear homewisdom I had proved, beguiled my way. They awakened a tender
emotion in me; for, my heart was softened by my return, and such a
change had come to pass, that I felt like one who was toiling home
barefoot from distant travel, and whose wanderings had lasted many
years.
The schoolhouse where Biddy was mistress, I had never seen; but,
the little roundabout lane by which I entered the village for quietness’ sake, took me past it. I was disappointed to find that the day
was a holiday; no children were there, and Biddy’s house was closed.
Some hopeful notion of seeing her busily engaged in her daily
duties, before she saw me, had been in my mind and was defeated.
But, the forge was a very short distance off, and I went towards it
under the sweet green limes, listening for the clink of Joe’s hammer.
Long after I ought to have heard it, and long after I had fancied I
heard it and found it but a fancy, all was still. The limes were there,
and the white thorns were there, and the chesnut-trees were there,
and their leaves rustled harmoniously when I stopped to listen; but,
the clink of Joe’s hammer was not in the midsummer wind.
Almost fearing, without knowing why, to come in view of the
forge, I saw it at last, and saw that it was closed. No gleam of fire, no
glittering shower of sparks, no roar of bellows; all shut up, and still.
But, the house was not deserted, and the best parlour seemed to
be in use, for there were white curtains fluttering in its window, and
the window was open and gay with flowers. I went softly towards it,
meaning to peep over the flowers, when Joe and Biddy stood before
me, arm in arm.
At first Biddy gave a cry, as if she thought it was my apparition,
but in another moment she was in my embrace. I wept to see her, and
she wept to see me; I, because she looked so fresh and pleasant; she,
because I looked so worn and white.
“But dear Biddy, how smart you are!”
“Yes, dear Pip.”
“And Joe, how smart you are!”
“Yes, dear old Pip, old chap.”
436 Great Expectations
I looked at both of them, from one to the other, and then––––
“It’s my wedding day,” cried Biddy, in a burst of happiness, “and I
am married to Joe!”
They had taken me into the kitchen, and I had lain my head down
on the old deal table. Biddy held one of my hands to her lips, and
Joe’s restoring touch was on my shoulder. “Which he warn’t strong
enough, my dear, fur to be surprised,” said Joe. And Biddy said, “I
ought to have thought of it, dear Joe, but I was too happy.” They
were both so overjoyed to see me, so proud to see me, so touched by
my coming to them, so delighted that I should have come by accident
to make their day complete!
My first thought was one of great thankfulness that I had never
breathed this last baffled hope to Joe. How often, while he was with
me in my illness, had it risen to my lips. How irrevocable would have
been his knowledge of it, if he had remained with me but another
hour!
“Dear Biddy,” said I, “you have the best husband in the whole
world, and if you could have seen him by my bed you would
have––––But no, you couldn’t love him better than you do.”
“No, I couldn’t indeed,” said Biddy.
“And, dear Joe, you have the best wife in the whole world, and she
will make you as happy as even you deserve to be, you dear, good,
noble Joe!”
Joe looked at me with a quivering lip, and fairly put his sleeve
before his eyes.
“And Joe and Biddy both, as you have been to church to-day, and
are in charity and love with all mankind,* receive my humble thanks
for all you have done for me, and all I have so ill repaid! And when I
say that I am going away within the hour, for I am soon going abroad,
and that I shall never rest until I have worked for the money with
which you have kept me out of prison, and have sent it to you, don’t
think, dear Joe and Biddy, that if I could repay it a thousand times
over, I suppose I could cancel a farthing of the debt I owe you, or that
I would do so if I could!”
They were both melted by these words, and both entreated me to
say no more.
“But I must say more. Dear Joe, I hope you will have children to
love, and that some little fellow will sit in this chimney corner of a
lviii] Volume III Chapter XIX 437
winter night, who may remind you of another little fellow gone out
of it for ever. Don’t tell him, Joe, that I was thankless; don’t tell him,
Biddy, that I was ungenerous and unjust; only tell him that I honoured you both, because you were both so good and true, and that, as
your child, I said it would be natural to him to grow up a much
better man than I did.”
“I ain’t a going,” said Joe, from behind his sleeve, “to tell him
nothink o’ that natur, Pip. Nor Biddy ain’t. Nor yet no one ain’t.”
“And now, though I know you have already done it in your own
kind hearts, pray tell me, both, that you forgive me! Pray let me hear
you say the words, that I may carry the sound of them away with me,
and then I shall be able to believe that you can trust me, and think
better of me, in the time to come!”
“O dear old Pip, old chap,” said Joe. “God knows as I forgive you,
if I have anythink to forgive!”
“Amen! And God knows I do!” echoed Biddy.
“Now let me go up and look at my old little room, and rest there a
few minutes by myself, and then when I have eaten and drunk with
you, go with me as far as the finger-post, dear Joe and Biddy, before
we say good-by!”
I sold all I had, and put aside as much as I could, for a composition
with my creditors––who gave me ample time to pay them in full––
and I went out and joined Herbert. Within a month I had quitted
England, and within two months I was clerk to Clarriker and Co.,
and within four months I assumed my first undivided responsibility.
For, the beam across the parlour ceiling at Mill Pond Bank, had then
ceased to tremble under old Bill Barley’s growls and was at peace,
and Herbert had gone away to marry Clara, and I was left in sole
charge of the Eastern Branch until he brought her back.
Many a year went round, before I was a partner in the House; but,
I lived happily with Herbert and his wife, and lived frugally, and paid
my debts, and maintained a constant correspondence with Biddy and
Joe. It was not until I became third in the Firm, that Clarriker
betrayed me to Herbert; but, he then declared that the secret of
Herbert’s partnership had been long enough upon his conscience,
and he must tell it. So, he told it, and Herbert was as much moved as
amazed, and the dear fellow and I were not the worse friends for the
long concealment. I must not leave it to be supposed that we were
438 Great Expectations
ever a great House, or that we made mints of money. We were not in
a grand way of business, but we had a good name, and worked for our
profits, and did very well. We owed so much to Herbert’s ever cheerful industry and readiness, that I often wondered how I had conceived that old idea of his inaptitude, until I was one day enlightened
by the reflection, that perhaps the inaptitude had never been in him
at all, but had been in me.
CHAPTER XX
For eleven years, I had not seen Joe nor Biddy with my bodily
eyes––though they had both been often before my fancy in the
East––when, upon an evening in December, an hour or two after
dark, I laid my hand softly on the latch of the old kitchen door. I
touched it so softly that I was not heard, and looked in unseen.
There, smoking his pipe in the old place by the kitchen firelight, as
hale and as strong as ever though a little grey, sat Joe; and there,
fenced into the corner with Joe’s leg, and sitting on my own little
stool looking at the fire, was––––I again!
“We giv’ him the name of Pip for your sake, dear old chap,” said
Joe, delighted when I took another stool by the child’s side (but I did
not rumple his hair), “and we hoped he might grow a little bit like
you, and we think he do.”
I thought so too, and I took him out for a walk next morning, and
we talked immensely, understanding one another to perfection. And
I took him down to the churchyard, and set him on a certain tombstone there, and he showed me from that elevation which stone was
sacred to the memory of Philip Pirrip, late of this Parish, and Also
Georgiana, Wife of the Above.
“Biddy,” said I, when I talked with her after dinner, as her little
girl lay sleeping in her lap, “you must give Pip to me, one of these
days; or lend him, at all events.”
“No, no,” said Biddy, gently. “You must marry.”
“So Herbert and Clara say, but I don’t think I shall, Biddy. I have
so settled down in their home, that it’s not at all likely. I am already
quite an old bachelor.”
Biddy looked down at her child, and put its little hand to her lips,
and then put the good matronly hand with which she had touched it,
lix] Volume III Chapter XX 439
into mine. There was something in the action and in the light pressure of Biddy’s wedding-ring, that had a very pretty eloquence in it.
“Dear Pip,” said Biddy, “you are sure you don’t fret for her?”
“O no––I think not, Biddy.”
“Tell me as an old friend. Have you quite forgotten her?”
“My dear Biddy, I have forgotten nothing in my life that ever
had a foremost place there, and little that ever had any place there.
But that poor dream, as I once used to call it, has all gone by, Biddy,
all gone by!”
Nevertheless, I knew while I said those words, that I secretly
intended to revisit the site of the old house that evening, alone, for
her sake. Yes even so. For Estella’s sake.
I had heard of her as leading a most unhappy life, and as being
separated from her husband, who had used her with great cruelty,
and who had become quite renowned as a compound of pride, avarice, brutality, and meanness. And I had heard of the death of her
husband, from an accident consequent on his ill-treatment of a
horse. This release had befallen her some two years before; for anything I knew, she was married again.
The early dinner-hour at Joe’s, left me abundance of time, without hurrying my talk with Biddy, to walk over to the old spot before
dark. But, what with loitering on the way, to look at old objects and
to think of old times, the day had quite declined when I came to the
place.
There was no house now, no brewery, no building whatever left,
but the wall of the old garden. The cleared space had been enclosed
with a rough fence, and, looking over it, I saw that some of the old
ivy had struck root anew, and was growing green on low quiet
mounds of ruin. A gate in the fence standing ajar, I pushed it open,
and went in.
A cold shivery mist had veiled the afternoon, and the moon was
not yet up to scatter it. But, the stars were shining beyond the mist,
and the moon was coming, and the evening was not dark. I could
trace out where every part of the old house had been, and where the
brewery had been, and where the gates, and where the casks. I had
done so, and was looking along the desolate garden-walk, when I
beheld a solitary figure in it.
The figure showed itself aware of me, as I advanced. It had been
moving towards me, but it stood still. As I drew nearer, I saw it to be
440 Great Expectations
the figure of a woman. As I drew nearer yet, it was about to turn
away, when it stopped, and let me come up with it. Then, it faltered
as if much surprised, and uttered my name, and I cried out:
“Estella!”
“I am greatly changed. I wonder you know me.”
The freshness of her beauty was indeed gone, but its indescribable
majesty and its indescribable charm remained. Those attractions in
it, I had seen before; what I had never seen before, was the saddened
softened light of the once proud eyes; what I had never felt before,
was the friendly touch of the once insensible hand.
We sat down on a bench that was near, and I said, “After so many
years, it is strange that we should thus meet again, Estella, here
where our first meeting was! Do you often come back?”
“I have never been here since.”
“Nor I.”
The moon began to rise, and I thought of the placid look at the
white ceiling, which had passed away. The moon began to rise, and I
thought of the pressure on my hand when I had spoken the last
words he had heard on earth.
Estella was next to break the silence that ensued between us.
“I have very often hoped and intended to come back, but have
been prevented by many circumstances. Poor, poor old place!”
The silvery mist was touched with the first rays of the moonlight,
and the same rays touched the tears that dropped from her eyes. Not
knowing that I saw them, and setting herself to get the better of
them, she said quietly:
“Were you wondering, as you walked along, how it came to be left
in this condition?”
“Yes, Estella.”
“The ground belongs to me. It is the only possession I have not
relinquished. Everything else has gone from me, little by little, but I
have kept this. It was the subject of the only determined resistance I
made in all the wretched years.”
“Is it to be built on?”
“At last it is. I came here to take leave of it before its change. And
you,” she said, in a voice of touching interest to a wanderer, “you live
abroad still?”
“Still.”
“And do well, I am sure?”

“I work pretty hard for a sufficient living, and therefore––Yes, I
do well.”
“I have often thought of you,” said Estella.
“Have you?”
“Of late, very often. There was a long hard time when I kept far
from me, the remembrance of what I had thrown away when I was
quite ignorant of its worth. But, since my duty has not been
incompatible with the admission of that remembrance, I have given
it a place in my heart.”
“You have always held your place in my heart,” I answered. And
we were silent again, until she spoke.
“I little thought,” said Estella, “that I should take leave of you in
taking leave of this spot. I am very glad to do so.”
“Glad to part again, Estella? To me, parting is a painful thing. To
me, remembrance of our last parting has been ever mournful and
painful.”
“But you said to me,” returned Estella, very earnestly, “ ‘God
bless you, God forgive you!’ And if you could say that to me then,
you will not hesitate to say that to me now––now, when suffering has
been stronger than all other teaching, and has taught me to understand what your heart used to be. I have been bent and broken,
but––I hope––into a better shape. Be as considerate and good to me
as you were, and tell me we are friends.”
“We are friends,” said I, rising and bending over her, as she rose
from the bench.
“And will continue friends apart,” said Estella.
I took her hand in mine, and we went out of the ruined place; and,
as the morning mists had risen long ago when I first left the forge, so,
the evening mists were rising now,* and in all the broad expanse of
tranquil light they showed to me, I saw the shadow of no parting
from her.
